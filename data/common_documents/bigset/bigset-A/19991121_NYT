GALAXY-UNITED MATCH HAS HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass _ Finally, the sequel has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has waited three years to avenge its 1996 disaster to
D.C. United, one of only two times in franchise history that the
Galaxy blew a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, United captured the Major League Soccer's
inaugural title, scoring three goals in monsoon-like rains and
winds over the final 21 minutes to earn a sudden-death, 3-2
overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Galaxy has become soccer's version of the
Buffalo Bills and Cleveland Indians _ having regular-season
success, but choking when it really counts.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has gone through two coaches and a change of
ownership to get back to the championship. But the latest coach,
Sigi Schmid, was a proven winner during 19 seasons at UCLA, winning
three national titles. And the owner, Denver-based billionaire
Philip F. Anschutz, has given Schmid the luxury of pampering his
team, allowing weekend getaways, and giving Schmid the freedom to
coach without distractions from management.
</P>
<P>
   But it all won't mean much if the Galaxy can't erase the
memories of 1996 and bring Los Angeles its first pro championship
since the 1988 Dodgers won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The weather, expected in the mid 50s and clear, provides a much
better setting than the last time these two met here.
</P>
<P>
   In front of more than 50,000 expected at Foxboro, Mass., for
today's reunion, the Galaxy and United will meet on the same field
where United's dynasty began and where the Galaxy's misfortunes
started.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in the Boston area are hyping the rematch angle with
full-page advertisements, wondering if these two teams can top what
many remember as the best game MLS has ever produced with the '96
final.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Galaxy was the favorite. This time, it is
the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations and stakes are much higher than they were in
'96,'' said Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri. ``That's because of
what D.C. has done in the past. They've been to the final every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But D.C. knows we play quality soccer as well. We are the two
teams regarded as the best in this country and play the most
enjoyable style for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you look at each of our last games. D.C. pounds
Columbus 4-0, and we take apart Dallas, 3-1. You couldn't ask for
anything better. You have the best team's peaking at the same time,
plus you have that rivalry built up from the inaugural season. It's
a perfect showcase for soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a mutual respect between the two sides. They both have
been the most dominant clubs in their conferences over a four-year
period. United has been in all four MLS championships, winning the
first two before losing to Chicago last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, which plays in a much tougher conference, has won
three Western Conference regular season titles and will make its
second trip to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Head-to-head, United leads the overall series, 8-4, and has won
six of the past seven meetings. This year the clubs split their
head-to-head series, with each winning on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sigi turning things around we expected the Galaxy to be
here this year,'' said United defender Jeff Agoos. ``We pretty much
knew if they played the way they could play, it would set up this
big game. They dodged some pretty good tests in the playoffs with
Dallas and certainly the league couldn't ask for a better dream
match-up.''
</P>
<P>
   United coach Thomas Rongen brushed aside the revenge factor.
After United loss to Chicago in last year's championship, he said
both team's will arrive this afternoon with something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenge factor doesn't mean anything to us, but it
certainly means something to them,'' said Rongen. ``Certainly our
guys remember the feeling against Chicago last year just as they
remember the feeling of '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a huge disappointment if we don't win this game.
But in a one-game championship with two evenly matched teams,
anything can happen.''

<P>
   Craig Billington has been around. This is his 15th season and
the Washington Capitals are the fifth team the 33-year-old
goaltender has been with, including the Bruins in 1994-95 and
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   As the backup, Billington spells No. 1 netminder Olaf Kolzig
once in a while and stops plenty of shots at practice.
</P>
<P>
   Billington, picked up from the Colorado Avalanche in July,
hasn't played that much. The 33-year-old brought a rather high
goals-against average of 3.80 into Saturday night's game against
the Bruins at the FleetCenter and a lofty 82.1 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But Billington, in only his second start of the season, stopped
all 28 shots the Bruins had on net, including 14 in the first
period in the Capitals' 3-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   It was his his 100th NHL victory, and his eighth shutout,l the
first since since blanking the Detroit Red Wings, 2-0, two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is you've got to win, and we've been on a pretty good
role, playing well getting some wins and playing with a lot more
consistency,'' said Billington, who stopped the Bruins five
power-play chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played against a very good Bruins team, one that was 9-1-1
in their last 11 games, and that was a good challenge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitals coach Ron Wilson told Billington he would get this
start, because it's one of the few back-to-back games Washington
has had so far and because Billington once guarded the Bruins net,
with a respectable 15-14-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been nervous since I was four and first strapped on the
pads,'' said Billington, whose team is 5-4-2 in its last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just find a way to use your nerves. But the guys were just
tremendous, it was a textbook road game and our guys deserve all
the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Billington has all sorts of respect for the Bruins, considering
the team had the NHL's fourth best power play percentage at 20.7
percent coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray (Bourque) shoots the puck so well and the Bruins have very
big forwards with (Dave) Andreychuk, (Jason) Allison and (Anson)
Carter and they go to the net well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting background that Billington has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the minors, I've been a top-round pick, I've been
put on waivers, I've been to an all-star game, I've been bought
out, I've been picked up on waivers, a lot of things have
happened,'' Billington said. ``I've been on an expansion team and
I've been on a Stanley Cup contending team.

TRAGEDY STRIKES IN RING, JOHNSON COLLAPSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ The main event between Andrew Golota and Michael
Grant was delayed Saturday night for the worst of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the semi-main event, a Brooklyn junior middleweight named
Stephan Johnson showed once again how dangerous a profession prize
fighting can be when he collapsed in the 10th round of his USBA
junior middleweight championship fight with Paul Vaden and was
taken from the ring on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was leading on the master scorecard now used in New
Jersey by 1 point at the time, had absorbed considerable punishment
before he finally went down almost on his own at 2:24 of the round
when he staggered backward after being hit by a jab. As Johnson
fell, Vaden nailed him with a final long, left hand and he tumbled
to the floor in a neutral corner.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's neck hit the bottom strand of ropes and he lay
motionless until ringside physicians rushed in and covered his face
with an oxygen mask for more than 10 minutes before immobilizing
his neck and bringing in a stretcher as an obviously concerned
Vaden watched from across the ring, a pained expression on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson never opened his eyes as he was carried out and the
concern for him mounted as his handlers looked on helplessly back
in his locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a bad hit the last one,'' said Dr. Rick Snepar. ``He
looked like he may have seized after he hit the ground. He's still
breathing, but it's shallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Johnson was removed on a stretcher and taken by
ambulance to Atlantic City Medical Center with his wife and fiancee
accompanying him.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his locker room, his handlers stood in stony silence,
not only fearing the worst but knowing they had received a warning
in April when Johnson went down in eerily similar fashion during a
fight in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happened in Canada,'' trainer Kenny Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   That was against Canadian champion Fritz Vanderpool in a fight
for the little known WBF title. Vanderpool won that fight the same
way Vaden won Saturday night, with Johnson stopped by an 11th round
TKO without being hit flush. But Johnson came back from that to
fight twice more this year and win, including a knockout of Calvin
Moody in October.
</P>
<P>
   But as he lay on a stretcher Saturday night, unconscious and
barely breathing, the memory of his handlers was not of a victory
but of the ultimate defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't stop breathing but the seizure suggested something
major,'' Dr. Snepar said. ``Some form of brain damage.''

CELTICS BURNED BY HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ ``This was personal,'' said the Heat's Tim Hardaway, his
voice very angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very personal,'' agreed Alonzo Mourning. ``We wanted to
shut them up, all the cheering and gyrations when they swept us
last year. That was enough motivation right there. All the
headlines, `Boston owns the Heat.' This is a business, but
(Saturday night) it was personal. We wanted to let them know who
the better team is.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA standings said this was a battle for the Atlantic
Division lead, the Heat vs. the Celtics, but Miami first wanted to
address some leftover business from last season. Personally. And
the Heat delivered the message, trouncing the Celtics, 110-92, in
Boston's last game at the Miami Arena _ the Heat move to a new
venue next month.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches spoke in coach-speak in analysing the game. ``I
think coming off their big win Friday night they were tired,'' said
the Heat's Pat Riley. Rick Pitino said the game was not a true test
because Miami had had three nights off while the Celtics had played
``four games in five nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was three games in four nights but that mattered
little because Miami (8-2) proved that its fastest start in
franchise history is no fluke. And the Celtics proved . . . well,
that the real identity of this Celtics team is yet to be
determined. Not yet close to Miami, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat in the Heat was clearly evident when garbage time
began late in the fourth quarter and Hardaway and the Celtics'
Antoine Walker crossed paths on the court as subs flooded the
floor..
</P>
<P>
   ``Go home, now,'' Hardaway shouted at Walker. And Walker shouted
back, ``It's a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season's regular-season series sweep of the Heat by the
Celtics was one of Boston's few bright lights. The Heat players
more than remembered the numbers. ``Don't say this was just a
game,'' said Hardaway, which Pitino and other Celtics more or less
said. ``This was more than a game.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three quarters it was a semblance of a game. Rookie
Adrian Griffin scored Boston's first 7 points (and 11 in the first
quarter), Walker was passing the ball and slipping inside for
several nifty baskets (``I thought Antoine player very well,'' said
Pitino) and Boston hung close, trailing, 28-27, after one and 54-49
at the half.
</P>
<P>
   But a horrid stretch near the end of the third quarter when the
Celtics turned the ball over four times on five trips down court
(``They were mainly unforced errors,'' said Pitino) sealed their
fate. A fate that loomed also because the Heat's Dan Majerle did a
magnificent job defending Paul Pierce. Pierce had his first basket
with 5:48 left in the first half and finished with only 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mourning (22 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 blocked shots)
was devastating against the center-deficient Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Portland,'' Pitino said. ``We can't come in against
the Heat and beat ourselves. Our No. 1 dilemma this year is
turnovers and it was once again (last) night. When we run our
offense, we get good shots but when we break our offense we turn
the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley was surpised the Celtics did not unleash their signature
pressing defense. ``They did not pressure us that much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat's Majerle and Mourning certainly pressured the
Celtics. ``Majerle played great defense,'' said Riley. ``Paul
Pierce didn't get many touches. Dan shadowed him and made it a
tough night for Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Celtics didn't help their cause much by turning the ball
over 20 times and getting a measly seven fast-break points (the
Heat had 24).
</P>
<P>
   The Heat's Jamal Mashburn scored 23, buried four 3-point
attempts, and was a force on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first acquired Jamal, I thought we were getting a
post-up player,'' said Riley of the former Kentucky star. ``It
turns out that he's a great up-and-down-the-court player who loves
to slash.''

CAPITALS SHUT DOWN BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some nights it just isn't there. The bounces are off, the
execution isn't up to snuff. It just isn't your night. That's how
it was for the Bruins Saturday night. They had no energy, no drive,
no emotion, and as a result were shut out by the Washington
Capitals, 3-0, at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time the Bruins have been blanked this
year, the other time being Oct. 4 at Toronto. The loss ended their
unbeaten streak at four games and was only their second defeat in
13 games (9-2-2). It was Boston's first loss at home since opening
night when the Bruins fell to Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a series like the Keystone Kops tonight,'' said coach
Pat Burns. ``We were falling, we made bad decisions with the puck.
It's going to happen I guess. Everybody was just not in it tonight.
There are going to be nights like that, that's why there are 82
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, there is no inspiration and right from the get-go
it was clear the Bruins had none.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:47 of the first, the Bruins were outshooting Washington,
8-2, but their scoring chances weren't prime. A tricky shot from
the blue line by defenseman Mattias Timander seemed to catch goalie
Craig Billington off-guard but beyond that, they did not put much
pressure on the former Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:09, the Capitals got all they would need on Peter Bondra's
11th goal of the season. Glen Metropolit, a 25-year-old rookie, was
behind the net and centered a pass to Bondra in the left circle.
Bondra one-timed his shot and it beat goalie Byron Dafoe to the far
side for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got a scare at 13:35 when pesky defenseman Brendan
Witt leveled a heavy check on center Joe Thornton. Thornton was
rammed into the boards in front of the Washington bench and it
appeared he landed left shoulder first and hit his head before
falling to the ice. He was shaken but went to the bench under his
own power and returned to play the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals' second goal, with 3:28 left in the period, was
ugly as the Bruins surrendered their first shorthanded goal of the
season. With Bondra off for holding the stick, center Andrei
Nikolishin, who had two goals, skated the puck down the left side
of the Bruins' zone, cut through the middle and scored on a
turnaround shot that eluded a screened Byron Dafoe at 16:32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Capitals played a perfect game,'' said Burns.
``They met us at the red line. We tried to dipsy-doodle around them
and got put on our ass. We lost possession of the puck. We gave
them the puck all night. I thought our passing was horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had three power plays in the first period but weren't
able to finish anything off. Part of that was due to strong penalty
killing by the Capitals, who went into the game having stopped 48
consecutive power-play chances and made it 53 straight as the
Bruins went 0 for 5 on with the man advantage. In the last 14
games, the Caps killed 60 of 61 power plays.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's fortunes never improved. The Bruins had a power play
midway through the third but Washington wouldn't allow them any
setup room and their fourth man advantage of the game came up
empty, evoking a loud series of boos from the crowd. ``We deserved
it,'' said Burns of the jeers. ``We deserved every single drop of
it. We didn't show up and play the game like it should be played. I
don't blame the fans. We were awful tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolishin wrapped things up with an empty-netter with 26.6
seconds left and Billington picked up his eighth career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fumbling everywhere,'' said Ray Bourque, who played
almost 28 minutes despite being under the weather as a result of
the flu. ``It was not one guy, it was pretty much through the whole
club. It's a very disappointing game for us. It was just a terrible
game.''

TCU'S TOMLINSON RUSHES FOR RECORD 406 YARDS, SCORES 6 TDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Move over, college football history; make
room for LaDainian Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, TCU's junior tailback three weeks removed from
suffering a serious left ankle sprain against Hawaii, recorded a
game for the ages, carrying the Horned Frogs to a 52-24 romp over
UT-El Paso yesterday afternoon at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's 406-yard, six-touchdown explosion rewrote almost
every major rushing mark in the TCU record book. And it set the
standard for NCAA Division I-A performers. For starters, Tomlinson
set:
</P>
<P>
   A single-game NCAA Division I-A record, breaking Kansas running
back Tony Sands' mark of 396 yards in 1991. He's the sixth back in
NCAA history to surpass 400 yards in game. The other five,
including the all-time NCAA mark of 441 by Dante Brown of Division
III Marietta, played in levels below Division I-A. Tony Jeffery's
TCU-record 343 yards against Tulane in 1986 also went by the
wayside.
</P>
<P>
   A single-season TCU mark with 1,725 yards, surpassing Kenneth
Davis' 15-year-old record of 1,611 yards. Tomlinson's 236 carries
this season also broke Davis' mark of 211.
</P>
<P>
   A single-game TCU touchdown record, besting Jeffery's
five-touchdown game, also against Tulane in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A TCU record for 300-yard games in a season with two. He had a
300-yard effort against San Jose State on Oct. 9. He also tied
Davis' record of three 200-yard games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   A TCU single-game mark for rushing attempts with 43. Mike
Luttrell had 40 against Rice in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's heroics highlighted a victory that clinched a second
consecutive winning season for the Frogs and moved them within a
victory of claiming a share of the Western Athletic Conference
title. TCU (6-4, 4-2) needs a victory over SMU (4-5, 4-2) on Friday
to tie Hawaii and Fresno State, both 5-2, for the WAC
regular-season championship.
</P>
<P>
   TCU also became bowl-eligible with the win, and indications are
the Frogs are headed to the first Mobile Alabama Bowl against No.
23 East Carolina on Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the game, I wasn't thinking about a lot of yards,''
Tomlinson said. ``All I was thinking about was winning the game. I
knew we had to get to six wins for a chance to be conference
champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson regained the Division I-A rushing lead he lost after
the Hawaii game. His per-game average jumps to 172.5 yards from
146.6 and ahead of previous leader Thomas Jones of Virginia, who
gained 91 yards yesterday to fall to 163.5. Wisconsin's Ron Dayne
finished the season with a 166.7-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson also moved into fourth on TCU's career rushing list
with 2,980 yards. He passed Jim Swink, Curtis Modkins and former
teammate Basil Mitchell yesterday. Tomlinson is only 14 yards away
from Davis at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's six scores covered 13, 1, 27, 1, 70 and 63 yards. He
broke Jeffery's single-game rushing record with the 63-yard score
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed about scoring that many touchdowns,''
Tomlinson said. ``I saw \Rformer Texas running back\S Ricky
\RWilliams\S do it twice last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson left the game after a 7-yard run with 2:34 to play.
TCU called a timeout as the 21,218 in attendance at Amon Carter
Stadium gave Tomlinson a standing ovation. The entire team left the
sideline to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters, students and adults all surrounded Tomlinson asking
for autographs after the final gun. ESPN, ABC and TV stations from
around the area called for interviews. A long night for Tomlinson
was just beginning, a TCU public relations official said on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never seen anything quite like that before,'' TCU coach Dennis
Franchione said. ``I've had some great rushing teams and some great
running backs, but I don't remember many days like that one.''
</P>
<P>
   How could he?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best ever,'' Franchione said. ``What have we been
playing college football, a hundred-and-something years and nobody
has ever been able to do what he just did today. It was pretty
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson thanked God, his linemen (''I think I'm going to buy
them a couple steaks''), the coaching staff, his mother, the fans
and anything else dressed in purple. His fellow players were left
speechless. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he did it, I can't even describe what it felt like,''
offensive tackle David Bobo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made my job a whole lot easier,'' said backup quarterback
Patrick Batteaux, who started the second half. ``All I had to do
was hand the ball off to him. I've got to carry out my fakes, but
it's kind of hard because I wanted to watch him.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU's press-box staff remained in contact with Franchione in the
fourth quarter as Tomlinson started to make a run at the record
book. At that point, the Frogs had the game in hand and Franchione
debated taking Tomlinson out of the game. With a short week ahead,
Franchione didn't want to risk re-injuring Tomlinson's tender
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get that close to something like that, believe me it was not
an easy call whether to take him out or let him try to get the
\Rnecessary yards\S,'' Franchione said. ``You get a young man who
puts himself in that kind of day, that kind of position, you need
to let him finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson missed the second half of the Hawaii game Oct. 30
after spraining his ankle. He was held out of practice the next
week, TCU's bye week, returned to play against North Texas on Nov.
13. Tomlinson looked a step slow against the Eagles, finishing with
75 yards on 21 carries.
</P>
<P>
   But he looked sharp early against the Miners. He was able to
make hard cuts and easily break through arm tackles. Tomlinson had
59 yards by the end of the first quarter and 119 at halftime. He
rushed for 121 more in the third and put the finishing touches on
the historic performance with 166 yards in the final period. His
63- and 70-yard scores came in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's two touchdowns in the third turned a 17-17 halftime
tie into a 31-17 Frogs' advantage. On TCU's first drive of the
second half, Tomlinson carried seven consecutive times for 71 yards
and scored from 27 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got smart enough to quit trying to throw it and just
give it to him,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ankle, Tomlinson smiled and said: ``I think it's real
good right now.''

BAFFLED STARS BLANKED BY HURRICANES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Floyd 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Mike Keane has had enough of the euphemisms and
silver linings and positive outlooks.
</P>
<P>
   After last night's 1-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes, the
Stars winger called the just-finished road trip as he saw it. The
view wasn't too good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a \Rhorrible\S road trip,'' Keane said in not-so-pleasant
terms. ``It's almost December, and I haven't looked at the
standings, but I've seen the box scores. Phoenix and LA are winning
and getting points. We aren't. You've got to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars captain Derian Hatcher: ``It's not that early any
more. It's 20 games in, a quarter of a season and we're 8-9-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Stars were below .500 was the beginning of the
1997-98 season when they started 0-1-1. You have to go back to the
1995-96 season to find another .500 record.
</P>
<P>
   The loss that ended that better-than-.500 streak had a familiar
feel _ a well-played game defensively, a defensive error that ended
up in Dallas' goal (Carolina's Paul Ranheim scored at 8:39 of the
second period) and a strong performance by goalie Ed Belfour. It
all added up to a loss because the Stars struggled to generate good
scoring chances and failed to score goals necessary to win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You allow one goal on the road, you've done your job
defensively,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Our problem is
still the same. We're still too light offensively, not near at the
level of determination or sacrifice necessary. ... It's really up
to the individual. Offensive hockey comes from hungriness. When
you're not hungry, you do bad things often. You don't make things
happen. We just don't have the hungriness.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars backup Arturs Irbe stopped all 24 of his former
teammates' shots for the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have scored five goals in last four games, including a
downward slide on this trip. After scoring two goals in Washington
on Wednesday, Dallas scored a single goal in Philadelphia on
Thursday and finished with a goose egg against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring struggles aren't anything new, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have scored more than two goals in a game only five
times this season, going undefeated in those games. Meanwhile, they
have been shut out four times this season. They were shut out 10
times all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our second and third chances are really few and far between,
and that's how we're going to break out of this,'' Stars forward
Mike Modano said. ``It's one shot here, one shot there. ... It's
really tough to keep trying to figure it out, day in and day out,
what the problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   The six forwards on the Stars' top two lines have accounted for
25 of their 41 goals this season. Defensemen have scored six more,
meaning the Stars have gotten only 10 goals from the rest of their
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all a little frustrated especially guys on the
third and fourth lines,'' said third-line winger Blake Sloan, who
has a goal and an assist in 20 games. ``If we're able to pop a
couple, that'd alleviate pressure off the top lines. ... I think we
need one to go off a butt or a shin pad, just to get the ball
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two other teams in the NHL have scored fewer goals than
Dallas _ the New York Islanders (32) and the Atlanta Thrashers
(40). Like the Stars, all of these teams are at the bottom of their
respective divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Stars players and coaches were preaching patience a couple of
weeks ago, saying standings didn't matter. The goals would start
coming, they said. The victories would follow. The standings would
take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been almost two months, and the Stars are beginning to
realize that scoreless games don't bring victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we know it, January is going to be around,'' Modano
said. ``To keep teams to three, two or one goal a game is great on
our part, but there is a whole other side to the game.''

USC HELPS MORTON KEEP HIS PROMISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chad Morton sat atop his teammates' shoulders
Saturday, the reward for keeping a promise: Eight was enough.
</P>
<P>
   The USC tailback was given a hero's ride amid the hundreds of
students celebrating on the Coliseum turf following the Trojans'
17-7 over UCLA before 91,384.
</P>
<P>
   After the decade began with Johnnie Morton catching the winning
touchdown pass against the Bruins, USC had gone eight years without
a victory over its crosstown rival when little brother Chad made
his brash prediction last summer.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday night, no one was doubting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad Morton can predict all he wants if he's going to be
right,'' UCLA wide receiver Danny Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Case closed. The Trojans finally ended years of futility against
UCLA by outmuscling the Bruins. USC had 214 yards rushing; UCLA
managed just 45. And doing most of the heavy lifting was Morton,
who ran for 143 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they had me up there on their shoulders, it's what I've
dreamed of,'' Morton said. ``To be a factor in the game, to be a
contributor and then to be carried off. There's no greater feeling
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a fitting reference to Johnnie Morton's big play in 1990,
he said, ``They're calling us bookends now.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was one of the uglier games of the rivalry,
befitting a pair of teams that entered the contest with 4-6
records. USC had 16 penalties and UCLA nine. The Bruins also had
five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   But the specter of the streak, and increased scrutiny of USC
coach Paul Hackett, added more emotion to this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bitter taste of last year, the way they rubbed it
in our face affected us,'' Hackett said. ``It was our time. Eight
years was a long, long time. I think the tide is turned and I feel
it will be turned for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But not without some controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Trojans were moving the ball up and down the field,
scoring points was a little tougher. Other than a 22-yard touchdown
pass from John Fox to Kareem Kelly in the second quarter, the
Trojans managed only a field goal and led 10-7 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   USC lined up for a field goal on fourth-and-8 at UCLA's 26 late
in the third quarter, when Fox took the snap and rolled to his
right, where he found tailback Jabari Jackson wide open for a
16-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were still unable to score a touchdown and again
lined up for a field goal. But UCLA's Ryan Roques dived into kicker
David Newbury, giving USC a first down, and the Trojans finally
scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they did and they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Fox found Kelly in the corner on a 5-yard pass and the freshman
caught the ball and was ruled to have scored a touchdown. Replays
showed his left foot landed out of bounds, but side judge Harvey
Jones ruled it a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know. I looked to the side and saw the ref's
hands go up. I did think it was a touchdown,'' Kelly said.
``Regardless if it was a touchdown or not, we still would have won
the game. Who's to say we wouldn't have come back and gotten a
touchdown anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, referee Jim Sprenger issued a statement to a pool
reporter: ``From where (Jones) was on the field, he saw the
receiver get control of the ball in the air and saw and felt he was
in bounds because he saw his second foot first, but when the
observers came in after the game, they said the first foot hit out
of bounds, and that would make an incomplete pass. That's the way
he saw it and there's nothing that can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo said Jones approached him afterward and
said he blew the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a mistake, but hey, he's human,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   USC also had its own contention. UCLA's DeShaun Foster appeared
to fumble, after defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed tore the
ball out of his hands, and ran nearly 75 yards before being
tackled. But the officials ruled Foster down on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year for us, let's don't even talk about calls,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (4-7, 2-6) did not lead statistically, but freshman
quarterback Ryan McCann of Agoura High had several opportunities to
pull out a victory. McCann threw three interceptions, however, and
all were damaging. Linebacker Zeke Moreno snared a pass at USC's
8-yard line to snuff out a scoring chance, and free safety David
Gibson caught a tipped pass at the Trojans' 2.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson also picked off McCann with three minutes left to
officially seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have dreamed going out this way playing like this
against UCLA,'' Gibson said. ``This is the best game I've ever had,
ending this streak. It's so important to USC alumni. I feel good
for the guys before us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it makes up for everything. This is the way I
wanted to go out against UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (5-6, 3-5) also sacked McCann six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, that was the best we played since I've been
here the last two years,'' USC defensive line coach Ed Orgeron
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of inspired play that has usually been missing
during all eight years of the streak, and had been absent from many
of this season's USC games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a miserable season, but here's this big beacon at the
end of the season,'' Hackett said. ``This is a monster.''

KELLY'S TD BRINGS CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a game that screamed out for a hero, a
touch of drama, a great moment, or something.
</P>
<P>
   It settled for something _ a speck of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's annual USC-UCLA titanic was being reduced to a
forgettable game of ``we can mess up more than you,'' when the
Trojans provided a morning conversation piece with a touchdown that
probably wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Kelly pulled down a 5-yard fourth-quarter pass from
quarterback John Fox in the corner of the end zone for what was
ruled a touchdown, although the freshman appeared to clearly first
land with his right foot beyond the sideline marking.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was obviously out of bounds,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said. ``The official told me coming up the tunnel he made a
mistake. Officials are human, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo was careful not to blame the play for the eventual 17-7
loss, but at that point there was a three-point difference in an
odd game of six turnovers and 25 penalties, and it did not seem a
great stretch to imagine the Bruins somehow finding enough offense
to muster another score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, maybe they fumble on the next play,'' UCLA
cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. said. ``Maybe our offense feeds off
that and marches down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe UCLA's streak over USC is at nine, instead of minus-one.
</P>
<P>
   It was Manning who defended Kelly on the end-zone play. Friends
after the two played together in last year's Shrine Game, Manning
said he wasn't sure Kelly had landed out until his teammates told
him after watching a big-screen replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``A touchdown is a touchdown,'' Kelly said. ``It was a
controversial call, but all year we've lost games because of
controversial calls. It ain't nothing. Take it away, and we still
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet instead of a tight three-point game set up for another
possible dramatic finish in this long rivalry, USC had a 10-point
lead that had to appear mountainous to the struggling Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Jim Sprenger said side judge Harvey Jones did not see
Kelly's right foot land out first, but his left catch the edge of
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the observers came in after the game, they said the first
foot hit out of bounds, and that would make it an incomplete
pass,'' Sprenger said. ``That's the way he saw it, and there's
nothing that can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA officials said they were told Jones became confused by the
multiple lines surrounding the end zone. There were yellow and red
lines inbounds, and a white line marked the out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had put USC ahead in the second quarter when he caught a
22-yard bullet from Fox for the Trojans' other score.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained a 10-7 game in the fourth quarter, both teams
taking turns stumbling over themselves.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had tried a similar fade route in the corner of the end
zone in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it too, to Danny Farmer,'' Toledo said. ``He was out
of bounds. They called him out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Farmer: ``They called him in, and called me out. That's the
way it goes sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Manning both went up for the Fox toss, but Kelly
cleanly won the mid-air battle for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get both feet down, because I knew I was close,''
Kelly said. ``When I looked at the replay, I saw my left foot drag.
I didn't see my right foot.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the foot landing first, and beyond the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the touchdown and who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have scored again,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we were going, we couldn't score anyway.''

BRUINS TRIP UP THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As thousands of USC fans celebrated on the
Coliseum turf, UCLA freshman quarterback Ryan McCann walked out of
the losing locker room, dropped his bags and opened his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot today; it's just too bad I had to learn it
against SC,'' he said with a quiet voice and glazed eyes. ``I feel
like 90,000 knives stabbed me and ripped me apart.''
</P>
<P>
   A few came from within.
</P>
<P>
   For disgruntled UCLA fans, Saturday's 17-7 loss was about the
touchdown that wasn't. For the discouraged Bruins (4-7, 2-6), it
was about everything else _ the missed tackles and the
interceptions, the dropped passes and the fumbles, the blown
coverages and the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the touchdown that wasn't would never have been if
not for a roughing-the-kicker penalty on UCLA senior Ryan Roques
two plays earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the emotion and it wasn't the effort,'' Bruins
defensive end Kenyon Coleman said. ``We've just got to execute. You
can't make that many mistakes and expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with a makeshift offensive line and a freshman quarterback
making his first start. Not with a condensed playbook designed to
limit mistakes. Not with a porous defense that yielded 430 yards.
And not with an inspired (and talented) Trojans defense fueled by
eight years of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Bruins had no margin for error, yet they cost themselves
21 potential points with three turnovers inside USC's 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes,'' Bruins defensive captain Pete
Holland said. ``There were lots of little fires. It was a microcosm
of the season, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann completed 17 of 29 passes for 204 yards and carried
himself well against USC's relentless pass rush. But he missed
several open receivers and threw three interceptions, including one
at USC's 8 and one at USC's 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enough time to throw,'' McCann said. ``I just threw to
the wrong guys at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's other crushing turnover came midway through the fourth
quarter. After the blown touchdown call gave USC a 17-7 lead, the
Bruins moved 74 yards in eight plays. On first down at the 7, USC's
Ifeanyi Ohalete slapped the ball from tailback DeShaun Foster.
Bruins tackle Bryce Bohlander pounced, but it squirted away from
under him and Ohalete recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it happened,'' Foster said, hunched over in
his stall in the far corner of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   There were other mistakes, plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   _Receiver Freddie Mitchell dropped two passes, including a
potential touchdown midway through the second quarter, and
sure-handed Danny Farmer dropped one.
</P>
<P>
   _Tailback Jermaine Lewis' face-mask penalty on a punt return
gave the Trojans great field position (UCLA's 45) from which to
begin their game-clinching touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   _Roques' roughing-the-kicker penalty, with 14 minutes remaining,
gave the Trojans first down at UCLA's 2. A few seconds later,
quarterback John Fox hit receiver Kareem Kelly in the end zone _ or
out of the end zone _ for the decisive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, it appeared Roques might have been blocked into
kicker David Newbury, which would have negated the penalty, but he
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped where I normally jump, and he hopped into me,''
Roques said. ``I don't think it was a good call. I was way in front
of the holder. He came forward into me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the complaints of a dead streak and a lost season.

DEPLETED MAVS ROUTED ON ROAD BY SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ This was not the way the Mavericks wanted to start
a 16-day stretch with eight of their next nine games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs pushed the Mavericks around as if they
were blocking dummies. With Cedric Ceballos and Steve Nash in
street clothes, and Gary Trent in Cleveland seeking a second
opinion on his strained left hamstring, the Mavericks never had a
chance against the defending NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs got 23 points from backup forward Jaren Jackson and
overwhelmed the short-handed Mavericks, 106-90, before 16,596 last
night at the Alamodome. The Mavericks are 4-7 after dropping their
third consecutive game, while the Spurs improved to 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos missed the game because of the flu. Nash took a
cortisone injection for an injured right ankle after Friday night's
game against Sacramento, and is slated to visit with team doctors
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at quite a disadvantage,'' Mavericks coach/general
manager Don Nelson said. ``We decided to try to take their inside
game away, and left the perimeter open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured if they were going to make \Rperimeter\S shots we
were going to lose. And they did, and we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs had the game well in hand midway through the third
period when they were up, 62-40. The only footnote remaining was
when former Mavericks forward Samaki Walker would make his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Walker got into the game with 3:08 remaining in the
third quarter, the Spurs were already ahead, 70-46. Walker finished
with four points, eight rebounds and a blocked shot in 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just another game,'' Walker said. ``We came out with a
big win.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the game when you look and see where that `W'
lies, that's got to be the most important aspect for me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson, it was virtually target practice as he found
himself wide open for many shots. Jackson made 8 of 19 shots,
including a career-high tying seven 3-pointers in a franchise-high
16 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have enough bodies to go up against them,'' said
guard Erick Strickland, who finished with 14 points and seven
rebounds. ``So, when they made their run there was nothing we could
do about it. We just had to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks trailed, 48-36, at the half. But the Spurs used a
14-4 run to open the third period, with Chucky Brown scoring six of
those points, to open up a 62-40 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have enough firepower, but I thought we competed
really hard,'' said guard Hubert Davis, who had nine points and
seven assists. ``We're all professionals, and the other people that
get to play just have to step up and just play as hard as they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley led the Mavericks with 19 points while playing 40
minutes. Dirk Nowitzki finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds,
while Shawn Bradley collected 16 points, 10 rebounds and four
blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Spurs' Twin Towers of Tim Duncan and David
Robinson were barely noticeable. Duncan did finish with 14 points
and 17 rebounds, and Robinson added seven points and seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But with Brown connecting on eight of 11 field-goal attempts for
16 points, and point guard Avery Johnson hitting 6-of-12 for 12
points, the Mavericks were caught between choosing whether to die
slowly from the outside or the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough playing like this and starting off on the road with
a bad loss like this,'' guard Robert Pack said. ``Hopefully we can
get a couple of guys back who were not feeling well, and just have
a better effort Tuesday \Rat Houston\S.''

ATLANTA UNEASY ABOUT RIDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes bright NBA executives can make the most boneheaded
mistakes imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Atlanta Hawks, for example. What in the world possessed
the Hawks to trade a darn good player _ and human being _ like
Steve Smith to Portland for a headache like Isaiah Rider? Hawks
executive Pete Babcock is one of the most respected general
managers in the business, but this made absolutely no sense, Petey.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is Exhibit A on how to be a professional. He comes to work
on time. He used his talents to make the all-star team. He gave his
alma mater, Michigan State, more than $1 million to build a student
center in honor of his late mother.
</P>
<P>
   Good guy. Clean image.
</P>
<P>
   Rider is Exhibit A on how not to be a professional. He's late a
lot of times for practice, games and planes. His ego demands that
the ball always goes through him on offense, or else he thinks
something must be wrong with the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, the Hawks suspended Rider for a game after
he didn't show up for practice. It seems two of Rider's vehicles
were damaged at the hotel were he's temporarily living, and Rider
thought the cars needed his undivided attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had paperwork and stuff to do,'' Rider said. ``It's
unfortunate what happened to my cars. It's unfortunate that I got
suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Isaiah, it's unfortunate that the Hawks thought you were
more valuable than Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Portland threw Jim Jackson in the deal to sweeten the pot for
Babcock. But Mavericks fans remember the day in Salt Lake City when
Jackson chastised guard Scott Brooks for not passing him the ball
in the waning seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   At least now, Babcock is not playing spin doctor. He admits
bringing in Rider was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the deal looking at the worse-case scenario,'' Babcock
said. ``So far, it has been the worse-case scenario. There's no use
sugarcoating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, then we won't sugarcoat it, either. You blew it, Babcock.
Big-time.
</P>
<P>
   Rider has become Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens most challenging
assignment in his 27 years on the NBA bench. And Wilkens isn't
sleeping well these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a point where enough is enough, but we aren't there
yet,'' Wilkens said. ``You can only push people so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect is a two-way street. So you have to have a player who
wants to be helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all of his trangressions, this past week Rider had to
nerve to say: ``This is not a strong team. That's why you've got to
give \Rthe ball\S to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make me the man like Steve Smith was, or get me out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks will be better served if they heed Rider's words and
get him out of there.
\Nsubheds:QUICK HITS Leon fallout Landon Cox is still fuming at the
Mavericks for what he calls their poor treatment of 19-year-old
rookie Leon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas did not make a mistake drafting Leon, because he has
the talent to play in the NBA,'' said Cox, who coached Smith at
Chicago's Martin Luther King High School. ``Where they made
mistakes is when they failed to get to know him and find out about
the tremendous problems he's been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ignored him and refused to treat him like a human being.
They just treated him like a piece of meat. They never even called
me for imput or returned my calls to them this summer until
\RWednesday morning\S after this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night, Smith was taken to Parkland Hospital's
psychiatric ward after allegedly overdosing on 250 aspirin. The
6-foot-10 forward has been released from the hospital after having
his stomach pumped.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the Mavericks showed no sensitivity when it came to
nurturing Smith, who was a ward of the state of Illinois from age 4
through 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas wants ready-made players,'' Cox said. ``But they
weren't ready to give Leon the special attention he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the Maverick organization had a job to play here.
There is teaching going on even in the pros. But these people in
Dallas don't care.'' \Nsubheds:Good ol' boys Jason Williams won't
discount his high school buddy Randy Moss as the next two-sport
athlete. Moss, a wide receiver with the Minnesota Vikings, said
earlier this season he'd like to tryout for the Minnesota
Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up with Moss in Virginia and the two played high
school basketball together. They're also featured in a national
shoe commericial where highlights of their high-school playing days
are woven in with clips of Williams playing basketball with
Sacramento and Moss playing football with Minnesota. All highlights
are done to the Dukes of Hazard theme song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have got Randy interested in basketball in high school
but this is all him,'' Williams said. ``He loves football. He'd
struggle at first \Rin the NBA\S and maybe have to go to a summer
league and get some seasoning, but he can play. If anyone can do
it, he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think he just gets bored in the off-season and
wants something to do, so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams would rather concentrate on his crossover dribble
instead of crossing over to football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get killed out there,'' said the 6-foot-1, 190-pound
Williams. ``The only position I could play is quarterback and I
couldn't see having all those 300-pound defensive linemen and
linebackers chasing me. I'd get killed.''  &LR; name:Dave Dondoneau
\Nsubheds:Payton's place This past week, Gary Payton became
Seattle's all-time assist leader when he notched his 4,894th
assist. Payton passed Sonics' assistant coach Nate McMillan, with
whom Payton is very close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to pass Nate,'' Payton said. ``I came in the
league with him and he's like a big brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for \Rthe record\S, and I'm glad it was a guy I
really respect and love.''
</P>
<P>
   When McMillan retired from playing last March 24, Payton
presented him with a $30,000 Rolex watch, and the inscription on
the back read: ``Take It Easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' McMillan said, showing off his watch. ``It's
love there.''
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT
Riley has once-stifling Heat playing red-hot on offense
The Miami Heat, running?
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so, Pat Riley, say it ain't so.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the team known for it's half-court offense, for
pounding the air out of the ball and firing up a shot just before
the 24-second clock expires, is actually running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat is ranked fourth in the NBA in scoring with 105.7
points per game. The Heat topped the century mark in five of its
first six games this season, after performing that feat on only
four occasions during the entire 1998-'99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking like the old Lakers,'' said Heat point guard Tim
Hardaway, in comparing the Heat to Riley's old run-and-gun Showtime
LA Lakers of the 1980's. ``But we're not a run-and-gun team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a run-and-score team. This is how it's going to be for
the rest of the season. We have the horses _ we always have.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley likes to call his team a ``sneaky fastbreak'' squad.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Riley and everyone with the Heat thought the new NBA
rules would hinder his team's work. The Heat are known as the
toughest defensive team in the league, and the new rules prevents
players from dislodging opponents in the post, and disallows
hand-checking.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat have actually benefitted from the new rules. Alonzo
Mourning is averaging 22 points, former Mavericks forward Jamal
Mashburn averages 19.9 points, and Hardaway averages 17.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   So, what gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as the new rules are going to hurt us defensively,''
said Riley, ``they will help us offensively because we have players
who can go to the basket. We can score.''

KINGS FEELING POWERLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It isn't quite at Defcon 4, but the Kings have a
crisis. Their power play continues to fail, unmasked by a more
disturbing trend of a lack of enthusiasm and lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Showing interest in only moderate portions during the first two
periods, the Kings lost 5-3 to an inferior and obviously less
talented Montreal Canadiens squad before a soldout Staples Center
crowd of 18,118 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time that the Kings have lost back-to-back games
this season. The Canadiens won their third road game of the season
and first since Oct. 14. They also won for the third time since
Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The urgent matter for the Kings is finding an answer to a couple
of puzzling questions.
</P>
<P>
   First, what happened to the power play that was dominating
games? And second, how can bottom feeders Chicago and Montreal come
to L.A. and outwork the Kings?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to swallow, but it's a good sign that it's (22)
games into the season before we did it,'' Kings defenseman Rob
Blake said. ``The passes weren't where they were supposed to be.
The power play wasn't going. That's why we won game early on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why they're losing them now.
</P>
<P>
   The power play, ranked third in the league, misfired on all
seven chances, including a 5-on-3 for one minute. The Kings have
not scored a power-play goal in their last three games, spanning 19
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from that, the Kings also turned off their intensity
switch. They survived to beat Chicago on Tuesday because goalie
Jamie Storr was splendid, but they lost to Phoenix two days later
against a Coyotes club that mucked and battled for three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Canadiens, fresh off a province-embarrassing 6-1 loss
to Nashville, skated with more purpose than the Kings. Andy Murray,
22 games into his tenure as Kings coach, wasn't ready to throw a
tirade but clearly was upset about this effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big thing was to step up and take responsibility,'' Murray
said. ``Everyone was there to get pats on the back when thing were
going well. Everyone should be there to take responsibility now.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who mixed lines in the third period to try to find a
spark, also didn't like his club's intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not to be a cheerleader behind the bench,'' he said.
``Tonight, it was the coaching staff doing much of the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times, the Kings cut two-goal deficits in half, but they
never scored the tying goal. They pulled within 3-2 early in the
third period on Marko Tuomainen's one-timer from the slot, but 1:33
later, a silly turnover allowed Montreal to pad its lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kings defenseman Aki Berg had a chance to swat away a bouncing
puck at center ice. Instead, it bounced off the heel of his stick
and Martin Rucinsky broke in alone on Storr, beating the goalie on
a backhander at the 3:40 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense played well for us (this season), but tonight
three of our six defensemen didn't play up to their level,'' Murray
said. ``We scored three goals in our building. We have to be better
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Kings had a chance late. Ziggy Palffy's second goal
of the night, a slapper from the slot, trimmed Montreal's lead to
4-3 with 12:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a few chances to tie it, but none better than
Donald Audette's opportunity from the right side of goalie Jose
Theodore. With most of the net open, Theodore made the save and the
rebound trickled a few inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to bounce back and our guys did,'' Montreal coach Alain
Vigneault said. ``It is a challenge every day. In a city where
expectations are always very high, we're trying to keep our
sanity.''

THIS GAME SUITS FLOP OF A SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fire the coach!
</P>
<P>
   Both schools, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   The last time two teams this rotten squared off in the annual
USC-UCLA football game was the day before Pearl Harbor in 1941. USC
was 2-6 and UCLA was 4-5 following a loss to Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side deserved to win that year and in fact they tied
7-7.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Saturday's bumbling display at the Coliseum was not quite
the most appropriate in the history of the intracity rivalry. Only
the most appropriate since the era of leather helmets.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote a fitting climax to the local college football season
as USC defeated UCLA at the Coliseum in a game in which the pivotal
performance was turned in by a nearsighted official.
</P>
<P>
   USC won 17-7 and didn't care a whit that on an artistic level,
the game was an overturned paint truck on the Harbor Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA lost for the first time since 1990 and found no consolation
in knowing that for much of the overcast afternoon the Trojans
looked as foolish as the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   It was depressing, though, for L.A. fans who just like to watch
good football. There wasn't any.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rivalry. It's unpredictable,'' David Gibson, the USC
safety who made the clinching interception, said by way of
explaining the ragged play. ``It seems like we gave UCLA every
opportunity to get back in the ballgame and were lucky to to escape
unscathed.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if any one moment sums it all up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the time, early in the second half, when an
official went down and was briefly attended to by trainers from
both sidelines. It was hard to tell if he was hurt or just worn
out. Twenty-five penalties were marched off for a total of 194
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the time, after the teams recorded five straight
three-and-outs in the third quarter, when they ran out of coffee
cups in the press box. Caffeine would have come in handy about
then.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was one of freshman UCLA quarterback Ryan McCann's
three interceptions or UCLA tailback DeShaun Foster's
fourth-quarter fumble at the USC 7.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the USC punt on which three penalties were called _
two against UCLA and one against USC _ and the whole play was done
over.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was one of the eight false starts among USC's 16
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, leading 10-7, the Trojans marched to the
Bruins' 1, only to jump before the snap. After a sack, a high
third-down pass and another false start, the Trojans missed a field
goal from 34 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was livid,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, with the score the same, the Trojans were inside
the 1 again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the next time we got down there we'd know what to do.
And sure enough, we jumped offside,'' Hackett said. ``I was beside
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That set up the play of the game. And the game's critical
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   From the 5, quarterback John Fox threw to the left side of the
end zone. Kareem Kelly jumped over Ricky Manning and snagged it.
But Kelly came down with his left shoe a foot out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Side judge Harvey Jones called it a touchdown. Videotape proved
he was wrong and he admitted as much later. This Harvey
!ital!wished!off! he was invisible.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo didn't blame the call for the defeat that
dropped the Bruins to 4-7, their worst finish in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have scored anyway,'' Toledo said. Anyway, the
Bruins weren't about to score again after McCann's second-quarter
touchdown scramble. It was the fourth time in five games they
managed a touchdown or less.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo blamed the sloppy performance on the Bruins' injuries.
They were down to their fourth-string quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start 45 different players (in a season), it's hard
to have any consistency or continuity,'' he said. ``At least in our
case, that was probably the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Trojans (5-6)? They were down to their third-string
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But they were in no mood for self-evaluation late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett used the euphemism ``hard-fought'' to describe the win,
admitting it ``wasn't one of the pretty ones'' while suggesting it
belonged among the series' classics anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Art wasn't in the USC curriculum Saturday. Winning was enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans wanted to end their eight-game losing streak against
the Bruins in the worst way, and you have to say they succeeded on
both counts. &QL;

L.A. FANS TAKE RIVALRY SERIOUSLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You know what they say: Southern California sports
fans are so blase.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. And God gave us earthquakes to occasionally stir us
from our complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The truth the Houstons and the St. Louises and the New Yorks
don't want to hear is L.A. has pleasant weather and passionate
fans, too.
</P>
<P>
   The proof was in the Coliseum on Saturday, where neither the
threat of rain nor a local football drought of epic proportions
could keep 91,384 people from showing up to watch unranked USC beat
unhallowed UCLA 17-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' victory, their first over the Bruins since 1990,
was shown on network television, all the more reason for Angelenos
to stay inside where it was dry and warm.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there was gridlock on the surface streets surrounding
the Coliseum three hours before the opening kickoff. The cars were
not lined up like pearls on a string because Angelenos are starved
for entertainment or suckers for a matchup of national title
contenders or Bowl-bound teams.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1941, the Trojans (5-6; 3-5 in the
Pacific-10) and Bruins (4-7; 2-6) both came to the game with losing
records. So it wasn't the promise of great football that drew a
near-sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was passion and pride, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos feel deeply and truly about our two major college
football teams. Loyalties to one school or the other are like fault
lines running through households, erupting every November.
</P>
<P>
   For USC fans, there had been a whole lot of shaking going on
since 1990, but not a lot of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The losses to UCLA kept coming like aftershocks, one after
another until it reached a numbing eight last year. Back in August,
running back Chad Morton, the heart and soul of the USC squad,
guaranteed a different ending this year.
</P>
<P>
   And so, cheering loudly and carrying a big umbrella, fans
streamed into the Coliseum on Saturday looking to either laud
Morton or mock him.
</P>
<P>
   What they were treated to was college football stripped of the
gaudy accessories _ the Bowl Championship Series rankings, the
Heisman Trophy hype and the like _ that have turned college
football into a sideshow to the main act of educating students.
</P>
<P>
   The 69th meeting of these two schools doesn't deserve a place in
the Getty Museum. It wasn't a masterpiece by anybody's reckoning.
There were 25 penalties and two atrocious calls by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed stripped the football from UCLA
running back DeShaun Foster and carried the ball inside the UCLA
10-yard line in the first quarter, but the Bruins retained
possession after officials ruled Foster was down and the play,
hence, over, when the turnover occurred.
</P>
<P>
   More egregious yet was the call by the side judge, Harvey Jones,
in the second minute of the fourth quarter with USC holding the
ball and the lead, 10-7. Quarterback John Fox lofted a pass to
freshman Kareem Kelly, who leaped to make the catch and landed with
his lead foot a few inches wide of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Jones signaled a touchdown and the score stood even though
replays on the video scoreboard showed Kelly clearly came down out
of bounds. Jones admitted after the game he had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo said it was a bad call but wisely didn't
bother to plead his case. He would have had a valid protest if the
Bruins had lost by seven or fewer points. But after Jones' call,
the Bruins compounded his error with mistakes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Foster lost the ball on the USC 7, freshman quarterback Ryan
McCann was intercepted by Trojans' senior safety David Gibson, and
Danny Farmer was stripped after making a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the stage was cleared for a pair of unlikely USC stars. It
was refreshing, in this day and age of the collegiate
student-athlete as NFL star-in-waiting, to see Fox and Morton bask
in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a senior who was lining up at linebacker for most of the
season, threw for 216 yards and two touchdowns and didn't have an
interception (McCann, by contrast, had three). Fox is using his
college experience as a springboard, all right _ to an elementary
school teaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, who is 68 inches of desire, darted and danced for 143
yards on 36 carries and along the way became the third USC running
back this decade to surpass 1,000 yards for the season.
</P>
<P>
   He is too small to join his older brother Johnnie, a receiver,
in the NFL. Indeed, many of the students who streamed out of the
stands and mobbed Morton at midfield after time ran out on the
Bruins' season towered over him.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Nobody on this day stood taller.
</P>
<P>
   By predicting over the summer that the Trojans would win this
game and stubbornly sticking to it in the days leading to the game,
Morton bought himself a few sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nauseous,'' Morton said. ``I couldn't eat. The biggest
thing is, I wanted to back up what I had said.''
</P>
<P>
   When he had done just that, he let the crowd carry him away,
literally. Rapturous fans turned the Coliseum floor into a giant
mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best feeling,'' Morton said. ``It's the feeling you
want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   We doubt any of the players on the No. 1-ranked Florida State
team got any greater high from their win Saturday over their main
nemesis, Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As Gibson skirted police batons and accepted hugs from strangers
in the game's glorious aftermath, he felt humbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you get a realization of how much this game means to
people,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the evidence was incontrovertible: If you build a sports
rivalry, Angelenos will come. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE ENDS SEASON ON SOUR NOTE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The six-month odyssey for the Cal State Northridge
football team ended with the hated opposition dancing and pointing
and celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion the CSUN players carried into the season finale
against Northern Arizona was sapped by the Lumberjacks, who
physically dominated the Matadors in a 30-10 victory Saturday
afternoon at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's season, which really started in May when the program went
under investigation for rules violations, ended with a losing
record. The Matadors dropped to 5-6 in front of 4,963.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was 4-4 in the Big Sky Conference. The Matadors were 7-4
and 5-3 in the conference last year and Ron Ponciano was named Big
Sky Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano was fired in July in the wake of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to endure a lot,'' CSUN senior tailback Jaumal Bradley
said. ``This team faced a lot of adversity. Nobody expected us to
do this well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who had a career-high 170 yards in his final
college game, wanted badly to beat the 17th-ranked Lumberjacks, who
solidified their argument for a Division I-AA playoff spot. NAU
(8-3, 6-2) won its fifth consecutive game _ and broke a losing
streak against CSUN at two years.
</P>
<P>
   There is bad blood between the programs, which recruit heavily
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are kind of our rivals,'' said Brennen Swanson, a
senior defensive end who had one sack and ended his career with a
school-record 31{. ``There's some hard feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotion bubbled to the surface during the game, which had 26
penalties (15 on NAU) and a flurry of personal fouls in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, was called for an
unsportsmanlike foul after erupting on the sideline in response to
a previous penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a physical game,'' CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady said.
``They were aggressive. I took a lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady was sacked four times and was hit several times after
throwing. He only completed 24 of 43 passes for 200 yards and he
threw three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks, who are third in the Big Sky Conference in
defense, held CSUN to 397 yards, 59 under its season average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, as a unit, (the Lumberjacks) are certainly one of
the top two (defensive teams we've faced),'' Kearin said. ``Man for
man, they have a lot of talent. They changed our philosophy; they
sat back and let us run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes, though, hurt the Matadors more than the Lumberjacks'
defense. Brady said his interceptions, the last of which was
returned by Cedric Jones 79 yards for a touchdown, were all on bad
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's first interception set the tone for the second half.
CSUN trailed 13-10 and was driving on its first third-quarter
possession. But Andre Smith picked off Brady at the NAU 5 and the
drive was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge play for them,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said: ``That play took the wind out of our sails a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks broke the Matadors with another important play:
Francis St. Paul's 75-yard touchdown reception with 3 minutes, 44
seconds left that gave NAU a 22-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they got the big plays,'' said senior
linebacker Jack Heaslet, who had seven tackles. ``They weren't
manhandling us. It was just the big plays that got us.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN answered St. Paul's touchdown with a gutty drive, which
unfortunately for the Matadors, ended in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   After Brady was sacked at midfield for a 9-yard loss, Northridge
faced a second-and-30 to start the fourth quarter. The Matadors got
exactly 30 yards on the next three plays, including a 1-yard plunge
by DeJuan Gilmore on fourth-and-1. But then the drive stalled on
the NAU 26 and Brady's fourth-and-17 pass, intended for Drew
Amerson in the end zone, was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get a consistent drive,'' Brady said. ``It didn't
feel like we were in sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Brady's frustration was Jones' two fourth-quarter
interceptions. Jones received unsportsmanlike penalties for
taunting at the end of both returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I just gave (NAU) seven points,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   The final minute was also marred by a personal foul. CSUN senior
receiver Terrence Jones was ejected after punching an NAU player on
the sideline.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There may be some hard feelings between UCLA coach
Bob Toledo and USC coach Paul Hackett, but the same apparently does
not apply to their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hackett and Elaine Toledo hugged and exchanged a kiss
between the locker rooms after USC's 17-7 victory over UCLA on
Saturday at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   As for their husbands, Paul Hackett admitted after the game that
he had been upset at Bob Toledo following last season's Bruins
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little animosity a year ago. I had not been in this
game for a while,'' Hackett said. ``I came out of the game a little
angry, only because I hadn't experienced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back, Bob was acting like he should. He had his game
face on and I was probably overreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was mad that Toledo had Cade McNown fake a run and try a
bootleg in the final 23 seconds of last year's game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought about having quarterback John Fox roll out
in the final minute, Hackett only laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The best? Hackett was asked if this was the biggest victory of
his career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the win in Hawaii was pretty big,'' he joked. ``This
is bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Where's Soward? Wide receiver R. Jay Soward caught just three
passes for 35 yards, but for a while it looked like he would have
only one catch.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, who said he was not bothered by his strained left
hamstring, fumbled on his first reception in the first quarter, and
did not play the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches, you know, felt after the fumble that maybe I'm
not ready after not practicing all week,'' Soward said. ``I came
back and I turned third downs into first downs in the second half.
I was a role player and if that was my role, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele out? Linebacker Markus Steele has torn tissue on the side
of his hip said there was a 50-50 chance he would play this week
against Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie time: Fox said the best thing about beating UCLA would be
going to his favorite cookie store in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make my favorite chocolate-chip cookies and it's been
pretty tough going over there,'' Fox said. ``You had to kind of
hang your head low before. Now, I think I'll have to go get some
cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   The workhorse: Tailback Chad Morton had a career-high 36 carries
for 143 yards. It was the most carries by a Trojan since Steven
Webster had 40 carries against Washington State in 1987. &QL;

NO RUNNING ROOM FOR FOSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A year ago, after rushing for 109 yards and
scoring four touchdowns, he was UCLA's hero. Saturday, after his
fourth-quarter fumble cost the Bruins a potential touchdown,
sophomore tailback DeShaun Foster felt an eight-game winning streak
collapse on his sturdy shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty much (as low) as I've been,'' he said. ``I'm
upset with myself. It was a key situation and a key spot on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   No one faulted Foster's effort. Running behind a makeshift line
and facing a ferocious USC defense, Foster rushed 17 times for 59
yards. They were tough yards, agonizing yards. Only once, on a
23-yard bolt, did he have room to roam.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fumble came after 2 bruising yards into the heart of
USC's defense, and in that respect it reflected UCLA's afternoon.
Their dominance of the running game ended at eight games, as well.
</P>
<P>
   They rushed for 45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   USC rushed for 214.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hard time sustaining drives and running the
football,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Not great, not bad: In his first career start, freshman
quarterback Ryan McCann completed 17 of 29 passes for 204 yards and
three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's assessment: ``He was spotty. He made some nice plays
and some bad ones. But he'll get better. He'll learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trick's on U-CLA: The Bruins tried four trick plays: a reverse
to Foster, a fake receiver pass, a hook-and-ladder, and their first
fake field goal in years.
</P>
<P>
   None of it worked, and the fake field goal cost them
holder/safety Joey Strycula, who sprained his ankle on the run and
missed several series in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern was that we would have a hard time scoring,''
Toledo said. ``That (fake) was a way to keep the drive alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The loss was Toledo's first in the city series.
He was 3-0 as a USC assistant in the 1970s, 2-0 as UCLA's offensive
coordinator in 1994-95 and 3-0 as the Bruins' coach....
</P>
<P>
   Third-down defense doomed UCLA again: USC completed 9 of 22
attempts....
</P>
<P>
   McCann was sacked six times....
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ryan Nece led the Bruins with 10 tackles. Defensive
end Kenyon Coleman, who played one of his best games, had nine....
</P>
<P>
   Toledo on Stanford winning the Pac-10 title: ``I called (coach
Tyrone Willingham) this week and wished him luck. I was hoping
they'd win. He's very deserving. And they'll be good. But they've
got to stop that Mack truck. (Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne) is
a heck of a runner.''...

Alabama. &QL;

GRANT BEATS DOWN GOLOTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ How do you say ``no mas'' in Polish?
</P>
<P>
   That's what referee Randy Neumann was wondering when he asked
Andrew Golota if he wanted to continue after he'd been knocked down
at 1:31 of the 10th round in a fight he was leading by five points.
</P>
<P>
   Golota's reply was ``Nyet,'' or something to that effect, and
thus Michael Grant remained undefeated Saturday night at Trump Taj
Mahal, despite proving that he has no idea how to box.
</P>
<P>
   What Grant does know how to do, though, is fight, a point he
proved more thoroughly than he would have liked after Golota
dropped him twice in the first round and knocked him from pillar to
post for much of the night. He unleashed a barrage of punches
midway through the 10th round that stunned Golota.
</P>
<P>
   Golota tried to hold on and the two wrestled for a time before
Grant hit him with a second flurry that ended with a right hand
that sent the big Pole tumbling onto his right shoulder. When he
got up, Golota began wandering aimlessly around the ring like a man
looking for his glasses, his face red, his nose bleeding, and his
heart beginning to shrivel.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked, Neumann pursued him and when he finally caught up
to Golota they had a brief conversation on the subject of
continuing his employment. Golota declined that option and resigned
his position. What he also resigned from was a fight he was leading
by five points, an overwhelming margin that Grant understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late in the fight, Don (Turner, Grant's trainer) told me, `You
know what you have to do?' '' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   What he had to do to remain undefeated and in Lennox Lewis's
crosshairs was to stop the tiring Golota and he found a way to do
that. For this Grant deserves great praise because he had to
survive a brutal opening round in which he was knocked to the floor
from two jabs and a right hand. After getting up he went down a
second time at the end of the round from an overhand right that had
him on his hands and knees when the bell sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I went down it was a test of my faith,'' said
Grant (31-0). ``He caught me sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost put him to sleep that round and by the end of four
rounds, Golota led by six points on the master card.

 &HT;    Changing HMOs pose problem
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Elinor and Howard C. Poff had heard about the
hassles people go through when their Medicare HMO pulls out, so
they were glad at first that PacifiCare Health Systems was staying
in Warren County. They had no idea their hassles would be worse
because PacifiCare didn't drop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard's not losing his insurance. He's just losing his
doctors,'' Elinor said.
</P>
<P>
   When PacifiCare decided to stop providing its HMO Jan. 1 to
4,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Montgomery and Clark counties, it
also disbanded the physician networks there. ``They said he was
going to have to go to Hamilton or Wilmington or Cincinnati with
all his problems,'' Elinor said. But the Poffs live in Franklin,
near the Montgomery County line, and Howard's glaucoma keeps him
from driving.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans will find themselves in predicaments like
Poff's on Jan. 1, with a Medicare HMO that no longer resembles the
one they joined but without the realistic option of returning to
Original Medicare and buying a supplemental ``Medi-gap'' policy to
fill the many holes in that coverage. Most won't be losing all
their doctors, like Poff, but the American Association of Health
Plans estimates nearly 60 percent of the 6.2 million Americans in
Medicare HMOs will have lower prescription drug benefits and 2.3
million will face increased monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   The 300,000 whose HMOs are abandoning them at least are
guaranteed acceptance for a Medicare supplemental policy regardless
of health problems _ unless they're on Medicare for disabilities
before they're 65. The seniors are given disenrollment
certificates, as the Poffs and their lawyer are fighting to
receive. All the people in Montgomery and Clark counties had to do
was stay with PacifiCare through Dec. 31 and buy the supplement
before March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Howard needs that guaranteed acceptance. Elinor is healthy and
65, but Howard is 69 with high blood pressure, insulin-dependent
diabetes and past brushes with bladder cancer, a stroke and
vascular surgery. ``No one will take him if they don't have to,''
Elinor said. And no one except another HMO has to take him because
PacifiCare hasn't left his county of residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee a Med-supp policy for everyone who drops
their HMO,'' said Bette Weisberg, regional director of Medicare
HMOs for the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration. ``Can you
imagine how many that would be?''
</P>
<P>
   All three Dayton-centered Medicare HMOs will either raise fees,
reduce benefits or both as of Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare will still offer at least $1,000 in
prescription coverage in two of its three plans, but they cost $70
and $85 a month on top of the $45.50 basic Medicare premium all HMO
members must pay. UnitedHealthcare still charges no premium, but
its prescription benefit is down to $300 a year in Montgomery
County and zero in Clark. Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield dropped
its monthly fee from $39 to $29, but like Aetna and United, it will
charge higher co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not understand what they're giving up when they join
an HMO,'' said Diane Lardie, who directs Ohio's Universal Health
Care Action Network in Cleveland. Many of them gave up an
employer's Medi-gap policy that was better than anything they can
buy now even if they're healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, said Lardie, do people understand Medicare HMOs can change
their rules from year to year. PacifiCare didn't tell the Poffs
that might happen when Howard canceled his supplemental plan to
join Secure Horizons. ``It was a fantastic policy three or four
years ago,'' Elinor said. ``The doctors he dealt with were led to
believe that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry blames Congress for urging companies to
develop Medicare HMOs and then slashing the Medicare budget in
order to balance the federal budget in 1997. ``This program's
future is in jeopardy,'' said AAHP President Karen Ignagni.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA criticizes the HMOs' financial management, citing studies
that show they are still overpaid and noting it will pay them an
average of 5 percent more next year for each Medicare HMO member.
</P>
<P>
   The AAHP is no more comforted by that claim than the apocryphal
statistic that someone drowned in a river with an average depth of
3 feet. It says nearly half the HMO beneficiaries live in counties
where the reimbursement rate will rise by no more than 2 percent,
while pharmaceutical expenses are going up by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Mutual of Ohio's recent decisions reflect the industry's
trepidation with Medicare. It was authorized to open an HMO in
Cleveland-area counties, but it decided instead to bypass HCFA and
create a discount prescription drug plan, targeted largely to
Medicare beneficiaries without that coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Where HMOs aren't dropping out of counties, hospitals often are
dropping the Medicare HMOs' contracts. ``Cincinnati is undergoing
some very significant changes,'' said Bruce A. Turner, Aetna's
Southwest Ohio general manager. ``We don't get enough from HCFA and
we can't pass enough along to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Aetna is committed to every county of its unprofitable
Medicare HMO for another year because of sentiment in Washington to
reverse at least some of the 1997 cuts
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think everybody would say if something doesn't happen
for year 2001, there are going to have to be dramatic changes in
(fees) and benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shortcoming of the Medicare system is that HCFA gives
HMOs less money to cover residents of suburban and rural counties
than those in urban counties. That ``fairness gap,'' as the AAHP
calls it, averages about 13 percent in counties neighboring
Montgomery County and is the reason most Medicare HMO withdrawals
are from outlying counties.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem's response this year was to reduce the rates it pays
physicians and other providers by the same percentages. United
adjusted by offering fewer benefits in outlying counties.
</P>
<P>
   After HMOs canceled their Medicare coverage for more than
400,000 people last January, a recent Kaiser Family Foundation
report said more than one-third suffered declines in benefits,
nearly 40 percent paid higher premiums and more than 20 percent had
to find new doctors. Those hurt most by the withdrawals were
minorities, the under-65 disabled and, as the Poffs would have
guessed, the poorest and the sickest.

   ``People say, 'At your age, you should have this and this and
this,''' Elinor said. ``Well, sure, at one time we did. We had
savings and mutual funds and stocks. But when you're faced with
retirement and medical problems, you have to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the comment, if I'm going to have to be a bag lady, I'm
going to have to move to a warmer climate. It's just too cold here
under the bridges.''

 &HT;    AS PRESIDENCY WINDS DOWN, CLINTON FOCUSING ON TYING UP LOOSE
FOREIGN POLICY STRINGS
 &HT;    (625&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ When he journeys on Tuesday to Kosovo,
President Clinton will be highlighting one of the riskiest and most
troublesome ventures of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, as in neighboring Bosnia, Clinton has sent Americans
into combat, committed troops to a long-term peacekeeping
operation, and spent billions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars to end
Europe's bloodiest conflicts since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of genuine reconciliation needed to knit the region
back together, however, remains elusive at best, and Clinton has
his work cut out for him in trying to shore up hard-won gains there
before the forces of conflict can tear them asunder.
</P>
<P>
   His quest to bring peace to the Balkans, though, is but one of a
half dozen loose foreign policy strings Clinton is scrambling to
tie together in his remaining year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Amid talk of a lame duck presidency on the domestic front,
Clinton is geared for an aggressive push to wrap up unfinished
business in a foreign affairs portfolio his administration has put
together over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a determination, White House officials say, to try to
lock in what progress has been made so far, before Clinton's
foreign policy operation turns back into a pumpkin in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount that we can do over this period,''
said White House National Security Advisor Samuel R. ``Sandy''
Berger. ``Fourteen months is a hell of a long time, particularly
when you're not running for re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's foreign policy to-do list includes peacemaking efforts
in the Middle East, Northern Ireland and Cyprus. Add to that the
attempt to expand and strengthen the global trading order.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, moreover, plays out against the even bigger job of
helping to shepherd Russia and China through the immensely
difficult, if quite different, economic, social and political
transitions both of those countries face.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is under no illusion that such work can be completed
before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In foreign policy,'' said White House spokesman David Leavy,
``it's never done.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, having devoted enormous resources in each of these
areas, Clinton has generated the kind of momentum that has the
potential to lead to achievements.
</P>
<P>
   And, with his prospects for large-scale domestic initiatives in
the months ahead largely compromised by the politics of an election
year, some analysts say foreign policy may hold out the greatest
opportunities for burnishing the Clinton legacy before he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very impressive in his mediation in Ireland and the
Middle East,'' said historian James MacGregor Burns, author of
``Dead Center: Clinton-Gore leadership and the perils of
moderation,'' a new book examining Clinton's presidency. ``But he
probably needs a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get none soon in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic of analysts concede that Balkans
recovery will take years, if not decades. NATO peacekeepers _
31,000 now, 6,300 of them American _ will remain to keep the peace
as far as anyone can see, and stitching together the economic and
political underpinnings of true Balkans integration with the rest
of Europe could well take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   That point was underscored during Clinton's 24-hour visit to
Greece this weekend, where anti-American protests reached a
crescendo of violence when an estimated 10,000 demonstrators had to
be stopped by police in riot gear using tear gas. But many
demonstrators hurled firebombs and rocks, smashing windows, burning
out shops and banks and wreaking havoc in the heart of downtown
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was aimed against U.S. policy in Kosovo and Bosnia
and the American-led bombing of Yugoslavia, a traditional Orthodox
Christian ally of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China are long-term challenges where progress is
measured, again, in years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-China relations, still strained by differences over Taiwan
and charges of Chinese spying against U.S. nuclear facilities,
appear to be bobbing back from their spring-time ebb, when U.S.
bombers inadvertently destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   White House trade envoy Charlene Barshefsky struck a landmark
deal with her Chinese counterparts last week in Beijing that opens
the way for China's admission to the World Trade Organization, a
goal Clinton has been working on since he took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russia relations, though, have plumbed a new low.
Washington and Moscow are far apart on four key issues: nuclear
arms control; Russia's war in Chechnya; the quest for control of
Caspian oil; and rampant crime and corruption that threatens the
economic transition at the heart of Russia's perilous turn from
Communism to free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections in Russia next month, and
presidential elections next June, few analysts believe there can be
big movements in Russia over these or other issues between now and
the time Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to grind it out,'' Leavy said, ``and have the
long-term vision that Russia's transition is probably the single
most important foreign policy challenge long term.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the global trading order won't be built in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes for advances in the negotiating round set to begin
in Seattle Nov. 30 for the WTO, the Geneva-based group that sets
the rules and regulations for global commerce. That round is likely
to take three years to conclude, however, long after Clinton has
become a private citizen again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has real expectations, though, for a resilient
breakthrough on Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, his special envoy for Northern Ireland issues,
former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, made real progress in brokering a
way forward for Republicans _ Catholics who favor breaking away
from the United Kingdom and becoming part of Ireland proper; and
Unionists _ Protestants who wish to remain a part of the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Far from a final agreement, Mitchell's accord at least maps out
a way ahead on steps toward autonomy for Northern Ireland's
Catholics as called for in the Good Friday peace agreement both
sides signed, with Mitchell's help, a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has devoted time, off and on, to the 25-year-old
Greek-Turkish dispute on Cyprus. While it's been a source of
enormous frustration to him, aides concede, Clinton was heartened
by the agreement last week by both parties to meet for negotiations
beginning Dec. 3 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest foreign policy prize yet within Clinton's
reach is a comprehensive accord on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat have both committed to laying out an agenda
for negotiations by February, and to completing those talks by
October.
</P>
<P>
   Snags in the process arose as recently as last week, when a
dispute stalled the process of Israeli withdrawals from portions of
the occupied West Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the most difficult issues _ the question of
Palestinian statehood and the future of Jerusalem _ remain to be
discussed. Those are expected to be negotiated in the tough months
sure to follow whatever agenda is agreed upon in February.
</P>
<P>
   Berger is convinced, though, that Barak and Arafat both see the
Clinton presidency as offering their best chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years and dozens of summit talks on the issue,
Clinton and his foreign policy team are deeply steeped in the
issues and complications with every possible step forward.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows, Berger said, and cares about, the personalities
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president knows Arafat and Barak better than Arafat and
Barak know each other,'' Berger said. ``He can help explain Arafat
to Barak and explain Barak to Arafat.''

   CLINTON-FOREIGN _ FLORENCE, Italy _ When he journeys on Tuesday
to Kosovo, President Clinton will be highlighting one of the
riskiest and most troublesome ventures of his presidency. In
Kosovo, as in neighboring Bosnia, Clinton has sent Americans into
combat, committed troops to a long-term peacekeeping operation, and
spent billions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars to end Europe's bloodiest
conflicts since World War II. His quest to bring peace to the
Balkans, though, is but one of a half dozen loose foreign policy
strings Clinton is scrambling to tie together in his remaining year

   MEDICARE _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Elinor and Howard C. Poff had heard
about the hassles people go through when their Medicare HMO pulls
out, so they were glad at first that PacifiCare Health Systems was
staying in Warren County. They had no idea their hassles would be
worse because PacifiCare didn't drop them. ``Howard's not losing
his insurance. He's just losing his doctors,'' Elinor said. When
PacifiCare decided to stop providing its HMO Jan. 1 to 4,000
Medicare beneficiaries in Montgomery and Clark counties, it also
disbanded the physician networks there. ``They said he was going to
have to go to Hamilton or Wilmington or Cincinnati with all his
problems,'' Elinor said. But the Poffs live in Franklin, near the
Montgomery County line, and Howard's glaucoma keeps him from
driving. Millions of Americans will find themselves in predicaments
like Poff's on Jan. 1, with a Medicare HMO that no longer resembles
the one they joined but without the realistic option of returning
to Original Medicare and buying a supplemental ``Medi-gap'' policy
to fill the many holes in that coverage. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News)

 &HT;    AS PRESIDENCY WINDS DOWN, CLINTON FOCUSING ON TYING UP LOOSE
FOREIGN POLICY STRINGS
 &HT;    (625&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ When he journeys on Tuesday to Kosovo,
President Clinton will be highlighting one of the riskiest and most
troublesome ventures of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, as in neighboring Bosnia, Clinton has sent Americans
into combat, committed troops to a long-term peacekeeping
operation, and spent billions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars to end
Europe's bloodiest conflicts since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of genuine reconciliation needed to knit the region
back together, however, remains elusive at best, and Clinton has
his work cut out for him in trying to shore up hard-won gains there
before the forces of conflict can tear them asunder.
</P>
<P>
   His quest to bring peace to the Balkans, though, is but one of a
half dozen loose foreign policy strings Clinton is scrambling to
tie together in his remaining year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Amid talk of a lame duck presidency on the domestic front,
Clinton is geared for an aggressive push to wrap up unfinished
business in a foreign affairs portfolio his administration has put
together over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a determination, White House officials say, to try to
lock in what progress has been made so far, before Clinton's
foreign policy operation turns back into a pumpkin in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount that we can do over this period,''
said White House National Security Advisor Samuel R. ``Sandy''
Berger. ``Fourteen months is a hell of a long time, particularly
when you're not running for re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's foreign policy to-do list includes peacemaking efforts
in the Middle East, Northern Ireland and Cyprus. Add to that the
attempt to expand and strengthen the global trading order.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, moreover, plays out against the even bigger job of
helping to shepherd Russia and China through the immensely
difficult, if quite different, economic, social and political
transitions both of those countries face.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is under no illusion that such work can be completed
before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In foreign policy,'' said White House spokesman David Leavy,
``it's never done.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, having devoted enormous resources in each of these
areas, Clinton has generated the kind of momentum that has the
potential to lead to achievements.
</P>
<P>
   And, with his prospects for large-scale domestic initiatives in
the months ahead largely compromised by the politics of an election
year, some analysts say foreign policy may hold out the greatest
opportunities for burnishing the Clinton legacy before he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very impressive in his mediation in Ireland and the
Middle East,'' said historian James MacGregor Burns, author of
``Dead Center: Clinton-Gore leadership and the perils of
moderation,'' a new book examining Clinton's presidency. ``But he
probably needs a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get none soon in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic of analysts concede that Balkans
recovery will take years, if not decades. NATO peacekeepers _
31,000 now, 6,300 of them American _ will remain to keep the peace
as far as anyone can see, and stitching together the economic and
political underpinnings of true Balkans integration with the rest
of Europe could well take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   That point was underscored during Clinton's 24-hour visit to
Greece this weekend, where anti-American protests reached a
crescendo of violence when an estimated 10,000 demonstrators had to
be stopped by police in riot gear using tear gas. But many
demonstrators hurled firebombs and rocks, smashing windows, burning
out shops and banks and wreaking havoc in the heart of downtown
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was aimed against U.S. policy in Kosovo and Bosnia
and the American-led bombing of Yugoslavia, a traditional Orthodox
Christian ally of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China are long-term challenges where progress is
measured, again, in years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-China relations, still strained by differences over Taiwan
and charges of Chinese spying against U.S. nuclear facilities,
appear to be bobbing back from their spring-time ebb, when U.S.
bombers inadvertently destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   White House trade envoy Charlene Barshefsky struck a landmark
deal with her Chinese counterparts last week in Beijing that opens
the way for China's admission to the World Trade Organization, a
goal Clinton has been working on since he took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russia relations, though, have plumbed a new low.
Washington and Moscow are far apart on four key issues: nuclear
arms control; Russia's war in Chechnya; the quest for control of
Caspian oil; and rampant crime and corruption that threatens the
economic transition at the heart of Russia's perilous turn from
Communism to free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections in Russia next month, and
presidential elections next June, few analysts believe there can be
big movements in Russia over these or other issues between now and
the time Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to grind it out,'' Leavy said, ``and have the
long-term vision that Russia's transition is probably the single
most important foreign policy challenge long term.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the global trading order won't be built in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes for advances in the negotiating round set to begin
in Seattle Nov. 30 for the WTO, the Geneva-based group that sets
the rules and regulations for global commerce. That round is likely
to take three years to conclude, however, long after Clinton has
become a private citizen again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has real expectations, though, for a resilient
breakthrough on Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, his special envoy for Northern Ireland issues,
former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, made real progress in brokering a
way forward for Republicans _ Catholics who favor breaking away
from the United Kingdom and becoming part of Ireland proper; and
Unionists _ Protestants who wish to remain a part of the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Far from a final agreement, Mitchell's accord at least maps out
a way ahead on steps toward autonomy for Northern Ireland's
Catholics as called for in the Good Friday peace agreement both
sides signed, with Mitchell's help, a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has devoted time, off and on, to the 25-year-old
Greek-Turkish dispute on Cyprus. While it's been a source of
enormous frustration to him, aides concede, Clinton was heartened
by the agreement last week by both parties to meet for negotiations
beginning Dec. 3 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest foreign policy prize yet within Clinton's
reach is a comprehensive accord on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat have both committed to laying out an agenda
for negotiations by February, and to completing those talks by
October.
</P>
<P>
   Snags in the process arose as recently as last week, when a
dispute stalled the process of Israeli withdrawals from portions of
the occupied West Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the most difficult issues _ the question of
Palestinian statehood and the future of Jerusalem _ remain to be
discussed. Those are expected to be negotiated in the tough months
sure to follow whatever agenda is agreed upon in February.
</P>
<P>
   Berger is convinced, though, that Barak and Arafat both see the
Clinton presidency as offering their best chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years and dozens of summit talks on the issue,
Clinton and his foreign policy team are deeply steeped in the
issues and complications with every possible step forward.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows, Berger said, and cares about, the personalities
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president knows Arafat and Barak better than Arafat and
Barak know each other,'' Berger said. ``He can help explain Arafat
to Barak and explain Barak to Arafat.''

 By SCOTT TUROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the age of 18, after my freshman year in college, I worked as
a mailman. This was merely a summer job. My life's calling, I had
decided, was to be a novelist, and late at night I was already
toiling on my first novel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the glories of postal employment in those days was that
once carriers learned their routes, they could deliver the mail in
far less than the five hours allotted. By longstanding agreement _
explained to me in a most emphatic and furtive way by a colleague
my first week _ mail carriers who finished early did not return to
the post office until the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Since the public library was the only air-conditioned public
building, even in that affluent suburban town, I spent my free time
there. And inasmuch as I wanted to be a novelist, I decided to read
James Joyce's ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   By then I had read Joyce's magnificent first novel, ``Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man,'' and I wanted to be a novelist just
like him. In homage to Joyce's embroidery from the stuff of the
Greek myths, I'd called my first novel ``Dithyramb,'' the name of a
Bacchic dance whose relevance was entirely elusive, even then, to
my story of two teen-age runaways from Chicago who witness a
murder.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Ulysses,'' even as a freshman I'd been taught that it
was hands down the best novel ever written. The literary god T.S.
Eliot had hailed the book in 1923 as ``the most important
expression'' of its age. ``If it is not a novel, that is simply
because the novel is a form which will no longer serve,'' said
Eliot, praising Joyce for being in advance of his time.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next eight weeks I read the novel to end all novels
for an hour and a half each afternoon at taxpayer expense. A number
of things struck me about ``Ulysses.'' First, it was hard. When I
finished, I was glad I'd read it, but I didn't mind that I'd been
paid by the hour to do it.
</P>
<P>
   I was also troubled that the library's single volume of
``Ulysses'' was there every day when I went for it, never checked
out. It seemed that no one else in this well-to-do, highly educated
community wanted to read the greatest novel ever written, at least
not in the leisure hours of summer. I thought inevitably of the
philosophical riddle with which schoolchildren were routinely
teased in those days: If a tree falls in the forest and no one
hears it, is there sound?
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the questions that plagued me for years. Was
``Ulysses'' really a great work of literature, if almost no one
read it for leisure, and if the few who dared found it so taxing?
What did writers owe their audience? How easy were we supposed to
make things for them? And what were we entitled to demand in
return?
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious that every writer, at least those who sought to
publish, craved an audience. But on what terms? The modernists, for
example, did not aim to be read by everybody. Their attitudes were
well expressed in Eliot's remarks about Joyce or in Ezra Pound's
declaration ``Artists are the antennae of the race, but the
bullet-headed many will never learn to trust their great artists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the modernists' view the writer's job was to lead culture, to
reinvent art constantly, thereby providing society with previously
undiscovered insights. It did not matter if the bullet-headed
didn't understand ``Ulysses,'' provided the few who could change
culture did.
</P>
<P>
   The radical democrat in my soul who was running amok in the '60s
had a hard time buying this. Yet even I had to accept the
modernists' formulation that artists must lead. But my view was
more of an I-thou relationship: The artist offers a special vision
that reframes experience in a way that, although intensely
personal, reverberates deeply among us all.
</P>
<P>
   To lead and arouse a universal audience seemed the writer's
task, yet it was hardly clear to me how to do it. Following college
I spent several years at the Creative Writing Center at Stanford
University, first as a fellow and later as a lecturer. The center
was roiled by intense factional rivalries that echoed much of my
own turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   A clutch of anti-realists, self-conscious innovators, championed
the views of John Hawkes, who had once declared, ``I began to write
fiction on the assumption that the true enemies of the novel were
plot, character, setting and theme.'' The experimentalists reacted
in horror when I contended that the ideal novel would be equally
stirring to a bus driver and an English professor.
</P>
<P>
   My ideas were much closer to those of my teacher, Wallace
Stegner, a realist writer in the tradition of James and Dreiser,
which had stressed an exacting representation of our experience in
the everyday world. The realists eschewed Dickensian plot, since it
depended on coincidence or the kind of odd or extreme behavior we
don't commonly witness. Despite my affinities, I was tweaked by the
experimentalists' complaints that the resulting literature was
often static.
</P>
<P>
   I dug through these issues in my own work, spending my years at
Stanford writing a novel about a rent strike in Chicago. The book
was steeped in the intricacies of real estate law, which explained
in part why it, like ``Dithyramb,'' went unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, writing the book had opened me to a previously
unrecognized passion for the law. I startled everyone, even myself,
by abandoning my academic career in favor of law school, vowing all
the same to live on as a writer. By the time I graduated, I had
published ``One L,'' a nonfiction account of my first year at law
school. But I still yearned to be a novelist, even as law school
had confirmed my attraction to the life of a working lawyer and,
especially, to criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I was hired as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Chicago. There I was astonished to find myself facing the same old
questions about how to address an audience. The trial lawyer's job
and the novelist's were, in some aspects, shockingly similar. Both
involved the reconstruction of experience, usually through many
voices, whether they were witnesses or characters. But there the
paths deviated. In this arena the universal trumped; there were no
prizes for being rarefied or ahead of the times. The trial lawyer
who lost the audience also inevitably lost the case.
</P>
<P>
   Engaging the jury was indispensable, and again and again I
received the same advice about how to do it: Tell them a good
story. There were plenty of good stories told in the courtroom,
vivid accounts of crimes witnessed or conspiracies joined. The jury
hung in primal fascination, waiting to find out what happened next.
And so did I.
</P>
<P>
   Thus I suddenly saw my answer to the literary conundrum of
expressing the unique for a universal audience: Tell them a good
story. The practice of criminal law had set me to seething with
potential themes: the fading gradations between ordinary
fallibility and great evil; the mysterious passions that lead
people to break the known rules; the mirage that the truth often
becomes in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to succumb to plot and to the tenacious emotional
grip I felt in contemplating crime led me naturally to the mystery
whose power as a storytelling form persisted despite its long-term
residence in the low-rent precincts of critical esteem. I was
certain that an audience's hunger to know what happened next could
be abetted by some of the values of the traditional realist novel,
especially psychological depth in the characters and a prose style
that aimed for more than just dishing out plot.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore the supposedly timeworn conventions of genre writing
seemed actually to offer an opportunity for innovation. Why not,
for example, invert the traditional detective tale by having the
investigator accused of the crime?
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born ``Presumed Innocent.'' I worked on that book for
eight years on the morning commuter train and was staggered by its
subsequent emergence as a best seller. My only goal had been
finally to publish a novel. I didn't even like most best sellers,
which I deemed short on imagination.
</P>
<P>
   I have, frankly, learned to enjoy all the rewards of
best-sellerdom, but none more than the flat-out, juvenile thrill of
entering so many lives. I love my readers with an affection that is
second only to what I feel for my family and friends, and I would
be delighted to please them with every new book.
</P>
<P>
   But I am, all the same, desperate not to be captured by that
audience. I have self-consciously avoided cloning ``Presumed
Innocent'' (to the oft-stated disappointment of many), knowing
self-imitation would violate the rules I set for myself to start.
Art _ or whatever it is I'm doing _ begins with the maker, not the
audience. Capitulating to established expectations means abandoning
that obligation to lead and is likely to yield the larded stuff
that too often oozes out of the Hollywood sausage grinder.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Greene, probably this century's most admired writer of
suspense fiction, remarked that all writers tend to be governed by
``a ruling passion.'' I regard myself as blessed to have been able
to discover mine.
</P>
<P>
   Over time I've realized that the ideal novel that deeply stirs
everyone will never be written. Even ``Anna Karenina'' grows
tiresome for some readers. The only true transcendence is achieved
by the entire family of writers _ of artists _ who, together,
manage to move us all. As individuals we can only dig toward our
ruling passions, uncover them and desperately hope, as we fall, to
be heard.

`I REMAIN IN DARKNESS': WHEN A PARENT BECOMES A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Collectors of the slender, restrained and elliptical books of
Annie Ernaux, which have been critical and commercial successes in
France for a generation, will want to have ``I Remain in
Darkness,'' even though it is a less gripping work than her earlier
works. Ms. Ernaux, a professor of literature who lives outside
Paris, has created something of a genre: the emotionally
minimalist, stylistically uninflected chronicles of a
hypersensitive middle-aged woman examining her own life and those
of her parents. Her work represents a severely pared-down
Proustianism, a testament to the persistent, haunting and
melancholy quality of memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Remain in Darkness,'' capably translated Tanya Leslie (who
has translated six of this author's earlier books), is a collection
of notes that Ms. Ernaux made during the two and a half years of
her mother's final illness. It is a sequel in a way to ``A Woman's
Story,'' an earlier memoir-novel that examined the subtly afflicted
relationship between the author and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   This new book, like Ms. Ernaux's other works, displays an almost
brutal conciseness, an absence of artifice and dramatization as it
relates in brief, narrowly factual fragments her mother's final
years. ``She just sits there on a chair in the living room,'' is
the opening sentence, dated December 1983. ``Staring straight
ahead, her features frozen, sagging. Her mouth not quite open but
gaping slightly, from a distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ernaux sustains this naturalism to the end, interrupting
here and there with commentary on her main theme, which is that in
getting sick, becoming incontinent, losing her mind to what seems
to have been Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Ernaux's mother forced ``an
agonizing reversal of roles between mother and child.'' But, sad as
it is, the idea that an aging person reverts to a kind of childlike
dependency, leaving the former child in a state of guilty mastery
worried about her own inevitable death, is not a thundering
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ernaux's uncompromising lucidity, her unwillingness to look
aside, to prettify or to sentimentalize, are all components of a
striking sensibility. And yet sometimes a rigorous sort of
antisentimentalism becomes a sort of sentimentalism itself. It is
not that one doubts the sincerity of Ms. Ernaux's pain but that her
intentional understatement, the repetition of images without
narrative explanation, becomes itself mannered, solipsistic. The
special quality of her writing is that it leads us in its very
suggestive spareness to a deeper sense of the common poignancy. But
this new book is so thin and undeveloped as to lack the quiet
impact of her others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ernaux tells us the basics in a short forward, before she
sets down the notes she took as she cared for her mother in her
final years. She tells us that her mother began losing her memory
two years after a car accident from which she seemed otherwise to
have recovered. For a while she lived in a residence for the
elderly, but she was unable to take care of herself there and moved
in with Ms. Ernaux and her two teen-age sons. When that arrangement
proved unworkable, Ms. Ernaux's mother went to the hospital for a
couple of months and then was put into a private nursing home where
she stayed until her death in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   This book reproduces the notes that Ms. Ernaux took during her
mother's years in the nursing home. They are not, she warns us,
``the objective chronicle of a patient's stay in the long-term
geriatric ward,'' but should be read ``merely as vestiges of
pain.'' The recurrent themes, expressed as always in laconic
phrases, are guilt, fear of mortality and the underlying
animosities that make themselves felt as mother and daughter play
out the eternal reversal of roles: ``I clipped her fingernails; she
moaned, despite the fact that I always take great care not to hurt
her. I can feel the sadistic streak in me, echoing her behavior
toward me a long time ago. She still loathes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ernaux faithfully records her visual impressions, her
sadness, her disgust, the ``foul stench'' of urine and feces, the
wrenchingly comic aphasia of the senile. She sees the woman who
shares the room with her mother resting one hand on her belly, and
Ms. Ernaux remarks, ``It's beyond sadness.'' She bends forward at
one point to check her mother's wheelchair. ``She leans over and
kisses my hair. How can I survive that kiss, such love, my mother,
my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ernaux is inconsolable when, finally, her mother dies. Her
guilt overpowers her, for having put her in the home in the first
place, for having failed to stop her pain, for having been
inadequate in the face of the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   These larger themes, it should be added, are extrapolations from
the wisps of prose that Ms. Ernaux set down in her notes at the
time. She does not interpret or explain, even when she makes some
epigrammatic statement that could use some explanation. ``The
maternal instinct,'' she writes, after reading a newspaper article
on motherhood and infertility, ``is tantamount to a death wish.''
That is certainly a suggestive remark, but Ms. Ernaux's refusal to
explain or annotate it is an example of the extreme minimalism that
she has chosen as her literary principle.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for a line like ``She still loathes me.''
It is not that one wants conventional explanations. The lack of
convention in Ms. Ernaux's shadowed writing is perhaps its chief
virtue. But in the case of this book, something more than that mere
statement would enrich the text without robbing it of the power of
its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ernaux turns daily life, with its colossal, invisible
struggles, into a kind of epic. She is one of those writers who
seem so unspectacular you feel that anybody could do what she does,
if only they took the time and made the effort. In truth, there is
more genius involved in the recreation of the world in a drop of
water than one might think. This book certainly has flashes of that
genius even as it leaves one breathing a bit shallowly, wishing for
just a bit more air.

 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to cyberspace, the mantra of
politicians vying for the title of most e-friendly, Republicans and
Democrats alike, has been ``Hands off and go slow.'' Yet lawmakers
have already passed a laundry list of bills that leave the federal
government's fingerprints all over the Internet, and more are in
the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts include inventing rules against the peddling of
Internet addresses, granting legal standing for digital contracts,
proposing bans on the Internet programming known as Webcasts,
prohibiting online gambling and regulating ``spam,'' the junk mail
of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just a partial list of e-era legislation that this
Congress has passed or is considering.
</P>
<P>
   Some are the products of politicians seeking a hot issue. But
others are being promoted by the same companies that originally
insisted on self-regulation or by traditional lobbying powerhouses
and special interest groups taking advantage of Internet fever to
promote laws that protect their niches.
</P>
<P>
   The business groups backing the growing list of bills defend
them as necessary rules of the road for electronic commerce.
Watchdogs, however, see a disturbing anticonsumer trend in much of
the legislation that could have long-term negative effects _ not
only on Internet users but on the very companies that are now
scurrying for new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, digital laissez-faire seems to be applied
arbitrarily. While laws to protect business interests like
intellectual property and digital contracts have been on the fast
track, proposals to lay out basic protections for consumer privacy
online have been pushed aside as unnecessary and contrary to the
need to keep cyberspace unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I characterize it as short-term-advantage thinking with
long-term implications,'' said Jerry Berman of the Center for
Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit group in Washington that aims
to work with industry to establish responsible Internet policy.
``My view is that the Internet is going to get hurt, consumers are
going to get hurt, and since all things come around, different
industry parts of the Internet are going to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Lane, who handles e-commerce affairs for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, and Harris Miller, executive director of the
Information Technology Association of America, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain rules of the road that we need legislation
to establish,'' Lane said. ``And the rules of the road that are
being created are an incredible empowerment tool for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Miller argues that rules governing things like privacy are
not necessary because Internet companies know that their customers
_ with ``just one click of a mouse'' _ will move from a Web site
they do not trust to one that offers them basic consumer
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Berman says that the trend has moved away from true
self-regulation to ``leave it alone _ except for this, except for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company says, `Except for this,''' he said. ``And maybe
that exception makes sense, but it should only be done after
careful scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Berman said, after watchdog and industry groups united
to fight the Communications Decency Act as a form of
unconstitutional censorship, Internet business associations set up
the Internet caucus to educate Congress about the complicated
issues presented by the global network and the need to legislate
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what has happened is a number of these issues have not
gone through the process,'' he said. ``And I am unhappy and
disappointed that regardless of what side the different industry
players are on, they are moving their agendas without this kind of
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one key Internet bill to outlaw so-called cybersquatting
_ the ransoming of .com, .net and .org Internet addresses using
famous names or trademarks _ was worked out largely in closed
meetings and passed last week as an attachment to the omnibus
spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the measure argue that it will give trademark holders
unprecedented rights to Web names at the expense of individuals and
small businesses and that it could have a chilling effect on free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   It could also threaten the authority and credibility of Internet
Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, a still tenuous and
experimental oversight board chosen by the Clinton administration
last year to oversee the distribution of Internet addresses, known
as domains.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN recently established its own rules on cybersquatting, but
the powerful Motion Picture Association of America and other
trademark groups, unsatisfied with the rules, pushed for stronger
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased willingness by lawmakers to put their
names on anything touted as friendly to e-commerce, Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who championed the first comprehensive
Internet deregulation bill, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, said most
of the Internet legislation pending in the 106th Congress was
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government simply doesn't have the answer at the moment,'' Cox
said, noting that evolving technology could eliminate the need for
rules over domain name disputes and problems like spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say there is not a distinction between good and
bad laws,'' he said. ``But by and large, as a policy matter,
regulation of the Internet should be put on hold because the
subject of the regulation itself is not yet settled.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But as technology companies increasingly make their presence
felt in Washington, the trend is not likely to go away.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, one of the companies most vocal in calling for a
hands-off approach to the Internet, is pushing legislation that
would force cable companies to open their high-speed Internet lines
to competition. The auction site eBay is pushing a database
protection bill opposed by the rest of the high-technology pack,
which fears that it could limit access to Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the increasing dissension among high-technology
companies, lobbies like the banking and insurance association are
pushing their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Such an alliance earlier this month turned a bipartisan
compromise for giving digital signatures the legal weight of their
ink-and-paper counterparts into a broader law that would eliminate
many record-keeping and consumer notification laws. In the end,
House Democrats who had supported the administration's push for the
narrower bill voted for the broader measure anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was very alarming and pretty surprising,'' said
Margot Saunders, managing attorney for the National Consumer Law
Center. ``Here we had a debate on the House floor for four hours
where the leaders were saying to their colleagues that this bill
hurts all Americans, it does not help electronic commerce. Yet you
had this huge block of middle-of-the-road Democrats completely
ignore what their own leadership was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly a matter,'' she added, ``of everybody being
scared to death to vote against the high-tech industry.''

   The cracked-looking fellow in a sandwich board that announces,
``The End Is Nigh!,'' has served cartoonists down the decades, but
for believers over many centuries the message has been no joke.
With the millennium upon us and a million pilgrims expected in
Jerusalem, once again expectations of Armageddon are stirring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apocalypse!,'' Monday night's absorbing two-hour edition of
``Frontline,'' offers a 2,000-year history of apocalyptic visions,
beginning with the final book of the New Testament, the Book of
Revelation, with its powerful images of a cosmic battle between
good and evil, heaven and hell, eternal damnation and an ascent to
Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Biblical scholars, abetted by reproductions of the nightmarish
imaginings of religious artists, trace the enduring belief in an
end to things to the Babylonian conquest and destruction of
Jerusalem in 586 B.C. During the long exile of the Jewish people,
the Hebrew prophets, influenced by other conquerors, from the
Persians to Alexander the Great to the Romans, contributed to an
apocalyptic literature that resonates in the preaching of Jesus and
John the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's scholars find the Bible sometimes allied with
history, sometimes colliding with it. The Book of Revelation,
written in about A.D. 95, is now interpreted as an attack on Rome
as the new Babylon. Rome responded, in celebration of its own
millennium, with vicious persecutions of Christians. Later,
Christian crusaders killed the Jews in their path. As Norman Cohn,
one of Monday night's droller guides, says: ``The official doctrine
was that all Jews must be converted to Christianity before the
Second Coming. But one way of settling this matter was to kill
them. Then there would be no unconverted Jews left.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century Martin Luther would turn apocalyptic thought
against the church itself, condemning the pope as the anti-Christ.
One of his disciples, Thomas Munzer, applied the Bible's
description of a struggle between the forces of righteousness and
the forces of evil to the peasant revolts in Europe. The narrator
observes, ``Three hundred years later Karl Marx would transform the
apocalyptic ideas of Munzer into a secular ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expression of the prophesied transformation of society
reached America in the Pilgrims' visions of a New Jerusalem. John
Winthrop exhorted the colonists to build ``a city upon a hill,''
and their revolt against Britain was seen as a battle against ``the
beast of the apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   The prophetically inclined have periodically proclaimed that the
reign of Christ was at hand. In the middle ages an apocalyptic
thinker named Joachim deduced that from the birth of Jesus to the
end of time was 1,260 years, 80 years away. When the appointed day
finally arrived, he was dead; the world survived.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century William Miller founded a sizable movement
known as the Millerites or Adventists, based on the belief that
Christ's return was imminent. Crowds gathered on Oct. 22, 1844.
When nothing happened, one Millerite recalled, ``We wept and wept
until the day dawned.''
</P>
<P>
   Prophecies of apocalypse, though not as specific as those of
Joachim or Miller, remain current. The Rev. Jerry Falwell tells his
congregations that he believes in the premillennial coming of
Christ. David Koresh's followers apparently believed that they
would end up in Jerusalem. The program ends with the news that the
Israeli police are keeping a close eye on new groups that take a
literal view of the old Book of Revelation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ On a recent Monday, 11,000 fans gathered in
Conseco Fieldhouse here to watch World Championship Wrestling's
``Monday Nitro,'' a live wrestling match with more plot twists than
an Italian opera. Behind a silver curtain near the ring, the
scriptwriters, Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara, stood with earphones
clamped to their heads, staring into television monitors, following
the action as 3.5 million people watched on Turner Network
Television, a unit of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On a screen above the ring, videotaped scenes played of a
wrestler stalking a woman through a parking garage. (``Kimberly,
I'm going to find you no matter where you hide!'') On stage, the
Nitro Girls dance troupe mimicked sexual intercourse to rap music
by House of Pain. Three-hundred-pound men with stage names like Sid
Vicious, Lex Luger and Sting shouted threats at one another. (``How
about a game of hide and seek? You hide. I seek. Then I destroy!'')
A wrestler named Jeff Jarrett broke an acoustic guitar to pieces
over the head of a fellow wrestler _ a woman with 19-inch biceps
and as much body fat as a strip of beef jerky _ named Midnight.
</P>
<P>
   During it all, Russo and Ferrara monitored the progress _ or
physical deterioration _ of their repertory players, offering
advice to the wrestlers just before they ventured on stage and
going over lines at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give the people what they want,'' Russo said
later. ``The people want girls in the ring, they want women and men
beating on each other, they want things you might not see at 8 p.m.
Gritty, in-your-face stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Russo and Ferrara have become two of the more
important people in television. Their move last month to Ted
Turner's empire _ from the rival World Wrestling Federation, whose
programs are run on UPN and USA Network _ made the front page of
Variety, a sign of how wrestling, in all its boisterous,
adolescent, violent, bloodstained, sweat-spattered glory, is
changing television.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has come to regard the two writers as the magic
bullet that makes wrestling programs among the fastest-growing
shows on television. At WWF, Russo and Ferrara have not been
replaced by scriptwriters, but by a committee of writers and
wrestlers working in concert to draw story lines with the precision
of a ``Friends'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling can no longer be left to vague plot lines and the
whims of the wrestlers themselves. The shows are surging in
popularity. They have moved beyond the cable channels into
broadcast television and are even attracting mainstream advertisers
like Coca-Cola and Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   UPN, which is owned by Viacom and Chris-Craft Industries, was
almost left for dead last year until it became the first broadcast
network to air wrestling. Now it is starting to beat some WB
programs and has put a dent into the Fox network's Thursday night
male-oriented schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at World Championship Wrestling, or WCW, say they
have been told that Fox, owned by News Corp., whose chairman,
Rupert Murdoch, is a bitter rival of Turner, is considering adding
wrestling to its prime-time lineup and is trying to lure Hulk
Hogan, one of the Turner wrestling empire's prized names. A Fox
spokesman, Gary Ginsberg, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Russo's move to WCW also has people wondering: Given the
newfound competition, will wrestling reach new depths of raunch? He
has already changed the tenor of Turner's family-oriented network:
Two weeks ago, WCW changed its rating to TV-14 from TV-PG, as Russo
_ a man who scripted in ``accidental'' female frontal nudity and
faked hangings when he was at the WWF _has incorporated steamy
story lines into what has become 1999's version of the
old-fashioned variety show. Has Turner thrown in the towel on
taste? A spokesman for Turner said he declined to comment on the
topic of wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   And the business of wrestling scriptwriting has begun to draw in
traditional television writers. Russo got his start in wrestling as
an editor of WWF magazine, but Ferrara studied theater in college,
is an alumnus of the short-lived UPN series ``The Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer,'' and says his favorite playwrights are Peter
Schaffer and Shakespeare. Three months ago, the WWF hired Tommy
Blacha, a former Harvard Lampoon writer who was a writer for ``Late
Night With Conan O'Brien'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Before Russo and Ferrara became widely recognized in the
industry as the first professional wrestling scriptwriters,
wrestling was loosely scripted by a member of the wrestling
management known as a ``booker'' _ usually a wrestler or a former
wrestler who booked talent and sketched out rough story lines,
while the wrestlers largely ad-libbed their own lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Russo and Ferrara work like any scriptwriter on a movie. At
the WWF, Russo said, he and Ferrara would gather in his den, turn
on ``The Jerry Springer Show'' for inspiration and while Russo's
young daughter ran in and out of the room, would write the
intricate story lines, dialogue and plots for 16 different segments
in a show. The script includes lines for the wrestlers, basic plot
outlines and even stage directions, though the wrestlers themselves
are allowed to devise the manner in which they dispatch their
opponents to the mat. Russo and Ferrara's work habits are much the
same at the WCW, but they are writing from hotel rooms more often.
</P>
<P>
   The story line, they said, should work seamlessly week to week,
52 weeks a year: There are no seasons in wrestling, no weeks off.
They meet almost daily with wrestlers to assure that plot lines
jibe with the wrestlers' on-stage personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to be part of the process,'' Russo said. ``You
have to come up with something that they are happy and comfortable
with, something that frees them to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he added, a wrestler's acting is of paramount
importance. ``This is no longer about how good a wrestler you are,
or how good a match you can put on,'' he said. ``More than 50
percent of this is now about personality. We can put words in their
mouth, but we can't give them emotion.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bret ``Hitman'' Hart, one of WCW's most popular wrestlers, said
Russo and Ferrara had transformed WCW's programs _ ``Monday
Nitro,'' ``WCW Thunder'' and various pay-per-view events _ from a
loosely organized set of faked matches into a cohesive narrative
that draws viewers back week after week. ``It has finally become
what it should have been all along, which is soap opera,'' he said.
``Of course, it is one of the weirdest soap operas you'll ever
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart is so pleased with his new writing team that he does not
harbor any ill will toward them for the accidental death of his
brother, Owen Hart, 33, a wrestler who died in May after a botched
stunt _ he was to be lowered into the ring from 50 feet, but fell
instead _ at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Mo. While Russo and
Ferrara's script called for the stunt, Ferrara blamed the accident
on mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, as it has since the 1950s, rests on the soap-operatic
conceit that there is always a good guy, known in wrestling jargon
as the ``babyface,'' and a bad guy, the ``heel,'' and these two
opposing forces of good and evil are supplemented by a Greek chorus
of morally ambiguous characters. But, Russo said, it is more
complicated than that. ``There is one word that we start and end
every conversation with: logic,'' he said. ``Once you lose the
logic of the situation, then you lose the realism and you lose the
audience. It's all about, `If you were in this situation yourself,
how would you handle it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is difficult to imagine how an ordinary citizen
would react if a 6-foot-5-inch man in leather underpants with the
phrase ``2 Cool'' on the back attacked him with a garbage-can lid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to move the plot along,'' Russo said. ``Tomorrow
we'll sit down and say, `Well, this is what happened to Kimberly
last night, and this is what will happen to her next week.'''
</P>
<P>
   Russo explained that the wrestler David Flair was stalking
Kimberly Page _ a woman in her late 20s with a master's degree in
journalism from Northwestern University _ because last week Ms.
Page injured him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She clipped him with her car,'' Ferrara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what made him go over the edge,'' Russo said. ``He just
went nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And she clipped him because the week before that he laid out
her husband with a tire iron,'' Ferrara said. Pardon? ``He sent her
husband to the hospital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Ms. Page and Flair will meet again for a live
pay-per-view wrestling match. Russo sees battles between genders as
a kind of opportunistic feminism. ``I like to paint women in a way
where they're not afraid to go into a man's world and prove
themselves,'' Russo said. ``It's not the woman being the victim.
It's the woman choosing to bring it on herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of battles prompted Russo and Ferrara to tell Brad
Siegel, the president of TNT, as soon as they arrived at WCW, that
they would have to incorporate elements that might cause the show's
ratings to change. ``WCW had this squeaky clean image, you know,
`We're a family show,''' Ferrara said. ``Well, I am sorry but the
whole basis of the show is two guys getting into a ring and beating
each other up. That to me is not family entertainment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I do not know one family that is sitting down watching `Nitro'
from 10 to 11 on Monday nights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the WWF, Russo said, the ratings were so high _ about 6
million viewers a show _ that ``it got to the point where we were
more or less entertaining ourselves. We would look at each other
and say, `All right, let's see how far we can go this week. How
much can we get away with?'''
</P>
<P>
   At times, that sure went far: On one pay-per-view episode, a
wrestler wrenched the prosthetic leg off another wrestler and beat
him with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain rules now,'' Russo said with a sigh. ``But
we can keep it under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Russo is disdainful of Blacha. ``You can't come from Letterman,
or Conan, and work in this world,'' he said. ``This guy comes from
television, and he's this artsy L.A. guy wearing clogs. And the
boys are looking at him like, `Who is this?' Do you think a
300-pound guy who has been in this business for 15 years is going
to sit and listen to some little kid in a pair of clogs?''
</P>
<P>
   But Blacha said: ``My clogs fit in fine in the locker room at
WWF. How can you sum up a human being by an article of clothing?''
Then he added: ``I'll challenge him to a
my-clogs-vs.-his-greasy-ponytail battle any day.''

PATENTS: CUSTOM-DESIGNED MEDICATION; PAINLESS EARRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is it that one type of anti-depressant can lift one
patient's spirits while the same medication leaves his neighbor
jittery and sleepless? Or that a certain asthma drug might
instantly open up one child's breathing passageways, while bringing
no relief to the next wheezing patient who walks into the
pediatrician's office?
</P>
<P>
   The reason lies in our genetic differences. Just as they
determine the color of our eyes, the genes we inherit help
determine how we will react to certain drugs. And as researchers
hurtle toward decoding the entire human genome, companies are
beginning to try to use this information to help tailor drugs to
better fit genetic idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   Genaissance, a privately held company in New Haven, Conn.,
recently received a patent covering what it considers to be a
fundamental approach to collecting and organizing this information
to better design drugs for populations according to their different
genetic makeups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We break down subpopulations to figure out which people from a
genetic perspective can be predicted, in the case of a given drug,
to have the best response or to have side effects,'' said Gualberto
Ruano, the founder and chief executive officer of Genaissance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Genaissance says, it found that people with a
certain genetic variation do not respond to albuterol, a
bronchodilator drug used to treat asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of the population, you can predict with certainty,
will not respond to this medication,'' Ruano said. ``From the
clinical perspective, it doesn't make sense to give these people
albuterol.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a consortium of 10 pharmaceutical companies
with a similar goal announced that it would develop a map of SNPs,
or single nucleotide polymorphisms, which are essentially small
variations in people's DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Genaissance also relies on SNPs, but organizes them into
haplotypes, which it likens to genetic bar codes that can be used
to identify connections between genetic variations and drug
response.
</P>
<P>
   Ruano said the two approaches were complementary. ``If you don't
know how a drug works, the SNPs approach works,'' he said. ``In our
case, we have a very good idea what the genes are, so we're
literally going to where the action is.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to use a metaphor, ``Instead of having one big library, it's
like deciding to look only at poetry and collect books by Pablo
Neruda or Robert Frost,'' Ruano said.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of authors, of course, Genaissance is collecting
information on specific genes that have been linked with all manner
of diseases, such as arthritis and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, Genaissance says it plans to have
created anthologies, or collections of information, for 2,000 genes
in a wide variety of ethnic populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can harvest as many anthologies as there are people who
represent the planet _ as opposed to creating an entire library
from the genes of just two people off the street of San
Francisco,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While ultimately such technology is likely to be used in the
doctor's office to screen for the appropriateness of certain drugs,
initially it will be used by pharmaceutical companies testing new
drugs. The technology will help them weed out people likely to
develop side effects and identify patients genetically predisposed
to respond well to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Genaissance received patent 5,972,614.
</P>
<P>
   An Earring Design That's Less Perilous
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Meridyth Mischel Webber, who lives in
Teaneck, N.J., ripped open her ear lobe when one of her earrings
became entangled in her comb. Ever since then, she has spent time
trying to invent an ``ouchless'' earring, and she has received her
third patent covering what she contends is the most important
improvement in earrings since clip-ons were introduced in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   From the front, Ms. Webber's earrings look like normal earrings
(albeit big normal earrings, because they cover the whole lobe).
But in the back, they feature a curved post that resembles an
upside-down coat hook. That post hooks inside the notch in the ear
that is just above the ear lobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My earrings don't pinch or clamp any area of the body,'' she
said. ``They are secure because that notch can hold anything. Plus
the bottom wraps around the back so it can use the lobe as an
anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webber's earrings are for sale at several stores in North
Jersey. She received patent 5,845,518.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

MUSIC INDUSTRY FAILS TO MEET TARGET FOR START OF ONLINE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATT RICHTEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After scrambling to adopt a technical standard for sales of
music online, record companies and hardware makers last summer said
they had paved the way for Christmas sales of portable digital
players. But the holidays are ringing in a reality: neither the
tunes nor the players will be in place to make this the first big
digital music Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the delay, Sony Electronics, a consumer electronics
bellwether, last week introduced its digital music player, the
Memory Stick Walkman, but said that it would not be for sale until
January. Meanwhile, major music companies say that the delay in
adopting standards _ along with logistical challenges _ has forced
them to abandon their one-time goal of making much of their music
available over the Internet by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The delays suggest the complexity of the still evolving
technical standards being developed by the recording industry's
Secure Digital Music Initiative, and they hint at continued
uncertainty for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They also reflect competing interests. The music companies fear
that insecure digital players will lead to rampant piracy of music
downloaded from the Internet, while the consumer electronics
industry sees the digital players merely as heir to the portable
cassette and compact disc player.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a final agreement on the first phase of the
specifications being developed by the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, or SDMI, is not even scheduled to be signed until next
week. Initiative officials plan to meet in Maui, Hawaii, on Dec. 1
to sign a contract with Aris Technologies Inc., which makes a key
screening technology for the portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hardware vendors have sought to play down the delay, suggesting
that a single holiday shopping season lost will make little
difference in a still-nascent market. At the same time, some say
they are disappointed that they were pushed to adopt and comply
with standards but will not reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   This delay hurts the ``credibility of SDMI,'' said Chris Smith,
portable audio program manager for Creative Labs. His company makes
the Nomad II, a portable player initially due out by Christmas but
now scheduled for distribution in the first quarter. When SDMI was
formed, he said, ``our stated goal was to have specifications by
June 30 so we could create products for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer electronics manufacturers said their concern had
been mitigated by the fact that their competitors' digital players
would not be on the shelves either. ``Our goal was Christmas,'' a
spokeswoman for Sony said, ``but in the grand scope of things,
missing one Christmas isn't going to make or break us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen portable digital players that record music
on tiny hard drives are already on the market. But those players
are not yet fully compatible with the technical standards, and it
is unclear how many of them will be able to be upgraded once the
new standards are in place. If they ultimately cannot meet SDMI
specifications, they would not be able to play the newest music _
either downloaded from the Internet or ``ripped'' from compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   What has made the issue so pressing from a music industry
perspective is that the downloading of music from the Internet has
gathered momentum. College students in particular, a huge music
audience, have taken advantage of the Internet to trade, download
and listen to music online in a format called MP3, opening both a
massive opportunity and a potential Achilles' heel for music
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The great fear of the music industry _ and of some musicians _
is that the existing MP3 technology makes it possible for people to
trade and distribute music freely, in blatant violation of
copyright laws and possibly costing the companies tens of millions
of dollars in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   The industry in turn regards the portable players as the
paraphernalia of music piracy because people will theoretically
have even more incentive to pirate music if they can copy, store
and play it on easy-to-use portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry's trump card is its vast catalogs of
popular music. Its promise to make this content available over the
Internet is what has lured the device manufacturers to cooperate in
SDMI. Without the content, the conventional wisdom goes, the market
for the devices will not thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Both the recording and consumer electronics industries expressed
optimism in June that they would meet the Christmas target. At the
time, a coalition of more than 100 companies from the two
industries agreed to the first SDMI specifications, which were
designed to eventually preclude the portable devices from playing
pirated music in the MP3 format. That first specification, called
Phase I, stopped short of preventing piracy but would have enabled
the players to be upgraded once the record industry settled on a
secure format for the delivery of music.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, these Phase I compatible players would screen
incoming music and prevent the devices from playing illegally
obtained songs. But despite the agreement in principle to Phase I
specifications, SDMI did not settle on the Aris screening
technology until Nov. 12. And, in fact, the final contract is not
slated to be signed with Aris until the Dec. 1 meeting in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The delays were so great that when Creative Labs begins selling
its Nomad II sometime in the first quarter next year, it will not
initially be Phase I compatible. To make it compatible, consumers
will eventually need to download software from the Internet, though
it is not entirely clear what incentive consumers will have to
download the software. The same is true of players expected from
Sanyo, Toshiba and Sharp, among others.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opponents of SDMI, which has been criticized as a
record industry initiative to maintain control of music
distribution, contend that the latest delays underscore much larger
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``SDMI is dead _ it's dead as a door nail,'' said Robert Kohn,
chairman and cofounder of emusic.com, an online music site that
sells songs in MP3 format. ``There's no document from which any of
these companies can develop specifications. They've developed a
framework, not specifications.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The music companies themselves are facing delays, partly because
of SDMI delays and partly because of technical logistics in
preparing their music for online distribution. Laurie Jakobsen, a
spokeswoman for Sony Music Entertainment, which now offers limited
downloads of music for promotional purposes, said that Sony would
be pushing back commercial distribution of music online ``because
of SDMI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do more as soon as there are players out there,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Samit, senior vice president for new media for EMI Records,
said there were also simple, practical matters to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the record companies have discovered that
they must explore how and whether each artist contract permits the
distribution of music over the Internet. ``We're going as fast we
can,'' he said. ``We are moving through mounds of paper.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: SELF-INDULGENCE IN THE INTERNET INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also E-COMMERCE-POLITICS) 
(mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, the Internet's growing lack of credibility among
consumers is becoming a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, two organizations _ one grass-roots, the other
representing industry _ announced their intentions to bring some
balance and intellectual rigor to a debate that has been almost
completely lopsided toward unfettered growth at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   One of the groups, People for Internet Responsibility
(www.pfir.org), is a global, nonpartisan network. It says its
mission is to make the voice of consumers and citizens heard at a
level equal to that of the corporations and governments that have
vested interests in how the Internet is run.
</P>
<P>
   The second, an industry organization called the Internet Policy
Institute (www.internetpolicyinst.org), says it wants to provide an
antidote to the ``noise, hype, rumors, marketing, IPOs and the
hopes of starry-eyed start-ups'' on the Internet by providing the
first independent, objective analysis and research about the global
network's development and use.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, several of the institute's backers have made billions
in that starry-eyed Internet economy, which raises the specter of a
fox with a mouthful of feathers guarding the henhouse.
Nevertheless, it contends that it will not lobby ``or otherwise
actively advocate or represent the interests'' of Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   As it should be, of course. But then, I'm not objective about
the subject. Aside from writing this column, I have also been on
the public-speaking circuit for nearly five years, keening about
the sorry state of credibility online and championing a code of
conduct for publishing.
</P>
<P>
   And after having spent much of the last year doing research and
interviewing Internet companies about disclosure and credibility
practices, I wonder how much change any industry-based organization
can effect without real, outside pressure from either consumers or
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations with nearly 40 Internet publishers,
vendors and researchers, it seems that the revenue-starved Internet
economy is far more willing to risk consumer wrath and rejection
than to voluntarily adopt a meaningful code of conduct or to reveal
too much about how it conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial focus was online journalism _ ``Freedom of
the press belongs to those who own one,'' said A.J. Liebling, and
pretty much anyone with a computer and an Internet account fits
that bill _ it became clear almost immediately that any standards
code would have to extend more broadly. Portals, search engines,
commerce sites, independent artists, universities and researchers
had all become ``publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   And while most journalists understand that with publishing comes
accountability, the ``accountability'' quotient was almost
completely absent on the Web at large, in almost every area, from
consumer privacy to customer service to disclosure of conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike print and broadcast media, for example, most Web sites
feel no particular need to distinguish between what information is
paid for by sponsors and what is not. In fact, next to labeled
advertising, the sale or barter of a hypertext link on a Web page
is probably the most fundamental value exchange for those
conducting business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When a commercial link is in or near a news story, credibility
advocates _ rightly aghast _ call the practice ``transaction
journalism.'' But the concept might better be called transaction
publishing, because it applies virtually across the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Transaction publishing is neither fundamentally good nor evil.
In fact, the ability to directly link pieces of information,
whether transactions or content, is the defining feature of the
Web. But precisely because the link is so powerful a metaphor, it
is particularly incumbent upon online publishers to give users full
disclosure _ as much context as possible to judge the substance,
value and credibility of the links they explore.
</P>
<P>
   This seems self-evident. Yet almost nowhere on the Web can users
easily find even the most basic contextual information, like a
company's physical location or telephone number. Or who or what
company owns and runs the Web site. Or what business(es) it is in
and how it makes money _ a fact that is not always obvious for
Internet businesses like portals, which derive revenue every which
way they can.
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial sites offer news and a search engine, but often
do not provide the source of the news _ nor do they volunteer
whether specific key words or links are sold and, if so, to whom.
And despite widespread privacy concerns, they are rarely upfront
about what personal information they collect and what they do with
it.
</P>
<P>
   It is evident from consumers' concerned reactions to paid
product endorsements on Amazon.com and DrKoop.com and to the more
recent revelation that RealNetworks was secretly vacuuming up
users' personal data without permission, that this wholesale
disregard for the truth is generating confusion and alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But amazingly, the specter of the online marketplace collapsing
as consumers sprint for the doors is not a sufficient impetus for
companies to clean up their acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an ideal confusion in the mind of the consumer
today,'' said the chief executive of one Internet company, who was
granted anonymity _ as were all the interview subjects _ in
exchange for candor. ``It's good if the consumer doesn't know
whether he's buying the watch from Casio's site or from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the marketing executive who spoke of a project in
which a prominent business publication worked closely with
marketing executives for his client, a big technology vendor, to
design a Web page. The idea was to make the links, which led
directly to the advertiser's site, exactly match the magazine's
editorial style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified,'' he said. ``No one seemed to understand that
once a consumer clicked on that link and found out that it took
them directly to an ad, their credibility was shot and they'd never
get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The many interview subjects who did support strong disclosure
standards for the Internet tended to be lawyers, researchers and
others who were concerned with long-term effects on the credibility
of the Internet as a medium.
</P>
<P>
   The rest are apparently banking on the ``ride this horse till it
drops'' strategy. And considering the amount of activity that their
bad behavior is generating, they may not have long to wait. The
burning question is what is going to bring them down? And who will
they take with them?

FINAL GRADES ARE READY ON YEAR 2000 READINESS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government is going to get a respectable report
card, with plenty of A's, when the House subcommittee tracking Year
2000 preparations issues what it calls its final grades Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason things look so rosy is that the subcommittee has
decided not to issue grades for more than 40 vital government
programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. As the committee sees
it, many programs dependent on the states and private organizations
are not completely ready for the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the kind of programs that affect everyone,'' said
Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Government Management, Information and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, who was president of California State University at Long
Beach and then a professor there before running for Congress,
instituted the grading system to draw attention to the potential
disaster facing many government agencies when he first began
investigating Year 2000 computer concerns in 1996. Many agencies
had no plan for dealing with potential problems. In fact, two
cabinet heads had never even heard of the issue, according to Horn.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a year ago, the government's overall grade was a
D. But the grades rose steadily as agency after agency reported
completion of its repair work, testing and development of
contingency plans. As the A's began to pile up, the subcommittee
shifted some of its focus to a gaping hole in its oversight effort:
the preparedness of state governments and private organizations
that the federal government relies on to provide federal money,
services and regulatory enforcement to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the subcommittee issued separate grades for the
first time to the agencies for the readiness of 43 programs
designated ``high impact'' by the Office of Management and Budget.
Suddenly, agencies sporting A and B ratings for their own work
found themselves on the defensive about state or private programs
rated D or F with only a few months left until the Year 2000
rollover. The fact that the problems were not at the federal level
was not considered an acceptable excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report will make it clear, though, that the expanded
grading proved to be more trouble than it was worth. Often, the
poor grade reflected incomplete readiness around the country where
services are delivered rather than substantial evidence of actual
Year 2000 vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the subcommittee is simply classifying
programs as ready or not, Horn said. The subcommittee report will
point out some worries that were not highlighted three months ago,
including concern about the readiness of owners of public housing
raised by a recent survey by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

`PUTTING IT TOGETHER': A VEILED SPIRIT, A HEART UPON THE SLEEVE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: `lite' in 6th graf cq.) 
(nk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the years she ruled as the queen of television
variety shows, from 1967 to 1978, Carol Burnett was a warm spot in
the seas of medium cool. At a moment when comedy kept turning
darker and angrier, Ms. Burnett offered brilliant clowning without
bile, satire without a sneer. Few contemporary comedians have
commanded such undiluted good will, and even today this actress
can't appear on a stage or screen without inspiring an instant
flood of affection.
</P>
<P>
   Now all this warmth is being put to the cause of removing the
chill from the songs of Stephen Sondheim, a composer whose talents
are as intellectual as Ms. Burnett's are instinctive, in the
misconceived revue ``Putting It Together,'' which opened Sunday
night at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. And as experiments in
thermodynamics go, this one is a nonstarter. It's not that Ms.
Burnett, who became a star on Broadway four decades ago in ``Once
Upon a Mattress,'' doesn't have what it takes anymore to seduce a
live audience; she does, in spades.
</P>
<P>
   It's that her tools of seduction are the opposite of Sondheim's.
The composer of such benchmark musicals as ``Company,'' ``Follies''
and ``Sweeney Todd'' writes intricate, introspective melodies and
lyrics with a heart that is vital but also hidden and guarded. Ms.
Burnett has always worn  &UR; her  &LR; heart on the outside, and even at her
broadest and loudest, she reads as both friendly and vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting It Together,'' a reworking of the Sondheim evening
first seen at the Manhattan Theater Club in 1993 (starring Ms.
Burnett's friend Julie Andrews), asks her to be sharp and brittle.
Ms. Burnett can caricature brittleness deliciously, but actually
being brittle is a chore for her. It's like asking a luffa sponge
to function as a razor blade.
</P>
<P>
   While there are moments in the production, directed by Eric D.
Schaeffer, when the Burnett and Sondheim sensibilities coalesce in
shiver-making flashes, they are sadly infrequent. The whole tone of
the show, which strings together Sondheim songs to shape a loose
story of five urbanites at a cocktail party, is out of sync with
its own material. ``Putting It Together'' is perversely determined
to make something lite of the dark bard of the American musical.
</P>
<P>
   These intentions are made clear in the opening moments, which
find Bronson Pinchot, who plays a character called the Observer,
racing down an aisle of the Barrymore dressed as an usher.
Pinchot's mission is to disarm with blithe stand-up commentary
about Sondheim. One example: ``Deep down, even his friends are
afraid that he's going to be cerebral, difficult, complicated,
wordy. ... And at dinner, he is.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a gag reference to Ms. Burnett's being lost in a
taxi, having followed directions given her by Kathie Lee Gifford,
the perky television host who is to substitute for Ms. Burnett at
some performances. The mood is firmly established: This is going to
be an amiable, jokey evening in which audiences can get cozy with
people who show up in People.
</P>
<P>
   What follows sticks fairly close to the form of the Manhattan
Theater Club production, with a few substitutes in the lineup of
songs. Ms. Burnett and the estimable George Hearn portray a rich,
middle-aged and deeply disenchanted older couple; Ruthie Henshall
(the smashing London star, late of ``Chicago'') and John Barrowman
are the sexy, wave-making younger pair at the party. She has
predatory ambitions; he has no discernible character whatsoever.
Pinchot is he who watches.
</P>
<P>
   Singing numbers plucked from shows ranging from ``Merrily We
Roll Along'' to ``A Little Night Music,'' from ``Sunday in the Park
With George'' to the movie ``Dick Tracy,'' the five characters make
love and war with one another before arriving at a spurious finale
of cheerful reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   This is accomplished before Bob Crowley's neon-splashed,
multilevel designs (with theme-heralding projections by Wendall K.
Harrington), which may be meant to evoke the worldliness of William
Hamilton cartoons but feel more like the swinger's playground of a
set for the old ``Laugh-In'' series. The effect is at once cute and
distancing. And as the show proceeds, the performers often seem to
be disclaiming the material they deliver, as if to reassure us that
any hard feelings they assume are only pretend.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, each of them seems to have arrived from a different
show-business universe. Watching them onstage is like looking at a
supermarket tabloid cover in which pictures of different
celebrities have been combined to create the illusion that they
were photographed together. Ms. Henshall provides the same
razzle-dazzle intensity she brought to ``Chicago''; Barrowman
contributes a pretty voice and a pretty face, though little else.
</P>
<P>
   Pinchot, best known for the sitcom ``Perfect Strangers,'' is
winsomely puckish. Hearn, who was a memorable Sweeney Todd, is
gentle, grave and low-key. His reflective version of that fine
ballad of midlife angst, ``The Road You Didn't Take'' (from
``Follies''), comes closer to suggesting a song's original context
than any other number in the show, but he is largely eclipsed by
the avidness of those around him.
</P>
<P>
   The vulpine Ms. Henshall is, as always, compellingly watchable,
but all that Fosse-style legwork seems a bit out of place here.
There's no denying her star quality, and she stops the show with
the gold digger's anthem ``More'' (from ``Dick Tracy''), but her
hard-sell flair is wasted on what is a trifle of a song. When she
and Ms. Burnett square off as Clare Booth Luce-esque rivals in
``There's Always a Woman'' (from ``Anyone Can Whistle''), they are
so mismatched that it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely, in fact, does the presentation here bring out the
best in either the songs or the singers. It was a lousy idea to
have Pinchot, whose forte is light flippancy, to sing ``War,'' a
tense narrative of erotic conflict from ``Night Music,'' while Ms.
Henshall and Barrowman smilingly execute a sexual ballet. The pair
is also bizarrely given the duet ``Unworthy of Your Love,'' which
was strong stuff when sung by characters representing Squeaky
Fromme and John W. Hinckley Jr. in ``Assassins,'' but turns watery
out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The real raison d'etre of ``Putting It Together,'' however, is
Ms. Burnett. Her fans (and I am one of them) will find that she
remains an inspired master of rubber-faced mugging and goofy vocal
inflections. And she has one searing moment of emotional nakedness,
with a ``Ladies Who Lunch'' (from ``Company'') that finds the raw
loneliness at the song's core.
</P>
<P>
   She also pulls off the funniest variation on ``Not Getting
Married Today'' (from ``Company'') that I've ever heard, slowing
down the number's usual breakneck pace to give italicized,
cartoonish weight to every element of a reluctant bride's anxiety.
The moment is entirely Ms. Burnett's, however, not Sondheim's.
Indeed, the composer's full presence is oddly absent throughout
this evening devoted to his work.

<P>
   E-commerce companies have enough to worry about when it comes to
competitive pricing, as Internet shoppers can visit
price-comparison sites like mySimon and DealTime.com to search for
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, shoppers do not even have to click away to another site to
find better prices. Several companies have developed a new breed of
so-called agents _ software tools that work with Web browser
software, offering shoppers better deals on whatever merchandise
they happen to be viewing on a Web page. For an off-line analogy,
imagine someone infiltrating the checkout line at OfficeMax and
telling people they can save money on the same products at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   Agent companies like ClickTheButton, DealPilot and R U Sure have
developed software that scans various shopping sites for price and
delivery data, then sorts it (most often by price). In some cases,
the agents also gather information about product availability,
shipping costs and the length of time it takes to receive the item.
</P>
<P>
   Once a user has downloaded software from one of these agent
services, though, the software is activated any time the Web
browser is open. Someone surfing the Web with ClickTheButton, for
instance, sees a bull's-eye icon in the corner of the screen. By
clicking on this icon while viewing a Web page about a particular
product, a price comparison page appears listing competitors'
prices for the item.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while a user was on an Amazon.com page featuring the
book ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' a ClickTheButton
search yielded price information from 15 retailers. Six of them,
including Amazon, offered the book for about $9, plus $3 for
shipping. One site, 1Bookstreet.com, offered the book for $10.77,
with no charge for United Parcel Service ground shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Such results essentially mirror those of shopping comparison
sites, but there are two fundamental differences between the
browser-based services and the shopping comparison sites. First,
the browser-based agents typically monitor a shopper's habits,
thereby allowing the services to make relevant offers at the right
moment. Second, merchants do not have to pay to be included in at
least two of these services _ a significant departure from shopping
comparison sites, which generally charge merchants fees to be
listed in prime positions.
</P>
<P>
   And although one might expect merchants to mount a
counter-assault against technologies that effectively hijack their
sites, Internet retailers have reacted to them with a surprising
air of resignation. ``These things are both intriguing and a little
bit scary,'' said Michelle Rubin, director of affiliate marketing
for the music seller CDNow. ``I think they will become more
sophisticated in the future, to give consumers a fuller picture of
what's important at a store beyond prices. But right now it's a
very freewheeling, competitive environment out there, and it's just
hard to stop stuff like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman, was even more sanguine. ``We're
comfortable with people making price comparisons, and qualitative
comparisons as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the current rate of consumer adoption, at least, Amazon
and its competitors may not have much to worry about.
ClickTheButton.com is among the oldest of the bunch, having rolled
out in March. It now has over 100,000 active users, Cheyenne
Ehrlich, the company's chief executive, said in an interview last
week. ``But we just started our marketing campaign this week,'' he
said, adding that the company's goal is to obtain 2 million users
by the end of next March.
</P>
<P>
   ClickTheButton scans information from 233 of the most visited
retailers in six categories: books, electronics, hardware and
software, movies, music and toys. Users download the software _ a
process that takes less than a minute on a 56-kilobit modem _ and
register with the company so it can monitor the user's shopping
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said the company made money from a few different
sources, including referral fees from some retailers that obtain
customers through ClickTheButton. Given the wealth of data the
company can collect about its users, ClickTheButton could
conceivably gorge itself at the trough of dot-com advertising, but
Ehrlich said it would abstain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take this data in aggregate and maybe tell Amazon where to
price their goods in order to get a certain percentage of people to
move from Barnes &AMP; Noble, but I don't want ads,'' he said.
``Nothing we do will let companies get back to users.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new company, Dash, has a somewhat different approach.
The company takes advantage of retailer affiliate programs, which
pay referral fees to sites that funnel sales their way. Dash
essentially serves as an intermediary: A software tool directs
shoppers to Dash's partner retailers, and Dash collects referral
fees whenever a purchase is made at one of its 100 or so partner
sites. Dash then passes those fees back to consumers with a monthly
check.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when someone is shopping for goods on the Gap.com,
a message will appear on the toolbar at the bottom of the browser
telling users that they can ``save 5 percent when you shop at
J.Crew instead.'' Users can then click directly to J.Crew's site
and shop as they would normally, knowing they eventually will get a
5 percent rebate check from Dash.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, if Gap signs up with Dash, J.Crew and other competitors
will not be permitted to display competing coupons when the user is
on Gap's site. At any time, however, users can click an icon on the
toolbar and view the savings available through competitors in the
Dash network.
</P>
<P>
   According to Daniel Kaufman, Dash's chief executive, the service
capitalizes on both the greed and the fears of merchants. ``The
greed factor is that any company loves the idea of advertising at a
competitor's checkout aisles,'' he said. ``The fear factor is that
if they don't work with us, their customers will see a competitor's
ads. In the end, fear and greed overcomes the negative effect of
paying a discount on every sale.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company earns referral fees from retailers in addition to
what it pays back to consumers, Kaufman said, and by allowing
companies to target users with specific offers. ``If I'm United
Airlines, I can target someone who flies to Orlando four times a
month, business class, on American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman hastened to add that merchants ``never know who is
getting a message,'' since Dash is the conduit. As with most of the
other browser-based shopping comparison services, Dash posts a
lengthy privacy policy on its site. (Dash hired Jason Catlett, a
well-known privacy advocate, to develop its privacy policy.)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are mixed on the promise these technologies hold.
``Give them credit for the idea,'' said Melissa Bane, an e-commerce
analyst with Yankee Group. ``But the trick here is to get people to
download these things. That's still a real barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Orton, chief strategist for Cognitiative, a consulting firm,
was more skeptical. ``People go to a site for a reason, and to be
sold off of that in the middle of the experience is not a likely
scenario,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman of Dash is predictably optimistic that both consumers
and merchants will warm to this technology. ``This is perhaps the
best way for consumers to capture value when shopping,'' he said,
noting that the service has 20,000 users after just two weeks in
business. As for Dash's relationship with retailers, Kaufman said
partner merchants could enjoy sizable sales advantage over
competitors. ``So we're in a pretty serious love-fest right now.''

JUDGE DISMISSES BIAS LAWSUIT AGAINST CNN 
EXECUTIVE EDITOR IS QUITTING TALK MAGAZINE 
LONGTIME EDITOR NAMED TO HEAD ST. MARTIN'S
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, CNN hired a veteran journalist, Art Browne, as a
senior editor in its New York office. What made the move somewhat
unusual for CNN was that Browne was 59 at the time, had been
unemployed for four years and suffered from a neurological
condition called essential tremor disorder, which caused his voice,
hands and head to shake.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months later, Browne, after being told that his work had
been unsatisfactory, was fired. He sued CNN last year, contending
that he was dismissed because of his age and his disability.
</P>
<P>
   But last Tuesday, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the
suit before trial, saying that Browne had failed to prove
discrimination and that CNN should receive credit for hiring him in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would do disservice,'' wrote Judge John S. Martin Jr. of
federal District Court in Manhattan, ``to the goals that our
anti-discrimination laws are designed to foster if we did not give
substantial weight to the fact that CNN hired Browne with full
knowledge of his age and disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of evidence of discrimination, the judge added,
were he to allow the suit to proceed, ``other companies would, in
the future, be reluctant to follow CNN's example and hire someone
like Browne.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen S. Binetti, a lawyer for Browne, said he had no comment,
but she criticized the decision, saying, ``It's dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge ignored critical evidence that we believe mandated
the denial of'' CNN's motion to dismiss the case, she said, ``and
it's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person was in this business for four decades,'' she said,
``and I find it incomprehensible that as matter of law, a judge
would find that he could not do that particular relatively
low-level job when he had tremendous jobs in the business in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN described the job Browne took in October 1995 as one with
important responsibilities. Browne had had a long career in
television and radio, working as national editor of ABC News in New
York from 1977 to 1981 and later in television news operations in
New Haven, Chicago and Washington. CNN hired him as senior futures
editor, a job that involved planning beyond the day's news for
events throughout the Northeast, CNN said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   But his superiors became dissatisfied with his performance,
giving him warnings, and in one case, removing him from coverage of
the explosion of TWA Flight 800 after he was found to be ``an
impediment to coverage,'' Judge Martin noted in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster his discrimination case, Browne said in legal papers
that CNN had replaced him with a 26-year-old ``who had fewer years
on this planet than plaintiff had doing television news,'' that
almost all of CNN's employees in New York were under 40 and that
his superior made derogatory comments about his disability.
</P>
<P>
   But in rejecting various arguments by Browne that he was a
victim of discrimination, Martin said ``poor work performance is a
legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to discharge an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN spokesman, David J. Bittler, would say only, ``We feel the
decision speaks for itself.''

   Executive Editor Is Quitting Talk Magazine
</P>
<P>
   Editors are leaving Talk magazine and its guiding light, Tina
Brown. First it was the managing editor, then it was a features
editor, and now it is David Kuhn, Ms. Brown's longtime deputy, who
followed her from Vanity Fair to The New Yorker and who has spent
almost a dozen years altogether under her editorial spell.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Kuhn resigned as vice president and executive editor
at Talk magazine. And he is headed for a place where editors also
tend to come and go with some dispatch: the media organization run
by Steven Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Senior staff members at Talk said that Kuhn had been actively
seeking a job outside Talk since September and that when Ms. Brown
hired Robert B. Wallace to be editorial director two weeks ago, a
position above Kuhn, his plans quickly firmed up.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn himself said Wallace's arrival did not prompt his
departure, saying instead that he had been offered an exciting new
opportunity: Kuhn will not join Brill's magazine, Brill's Content,
but instead will head Brill's new Web division, which Brill refuses
to discuss yet but which his magazine's staff members describe as a
commerce site to be introduced in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said his expectations for Talk remained buoyant, despite
its decided lack of buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely proud of my contribution to Talk, and it was an
amazing launch for a magazine, and I was thrilled to be a part of
it,'' he said. ``Launches are launches, so to say that there was
never a bump would be ridiculous. But what I am going to do is an
altogether different life choice, and involves an area that has
been increasingly interesting to me over the last six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn also declined to discuss just what he was so excited about,
but did offer other clues: As part of his compensation package, he
said he will receive an equity stake in Brill's Internet venture.
``Basically I have a participation in this company that is really
thrilling to me,'' he said.

   Longtime Editor Named to Head St. Martin's
</P>
<P>
   Still recovering from the recall of its George W. Bush
biography, St. Martin's Press last week chose a longtime editor of
its literary list to replace the departed editor in chief, who fled
abruptly saying he was disgusted with the book.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's announced the appointment last week of George
Witte, 39, who got his start at the company, which is owned by
Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, in 1985 as an editorial
assistant with a graduate degree in English from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. More recently, Witte had presided
over St. Martin's literary imprint, Picador USA, as publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see myself doing anything dramatically
different in changing the way that St. Martin's publishes and
acquires books,'' Witte said. ``It all starts with the books that
you buy and I want to be as accessible to the editors as I can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those editors were naturally flustered when their previous boss,
Robert B. Wallace, resigned on Oct. 26 because he did not want to
be associated with books like ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and
the Making of an American President,'' which was published by the
company's independent imprint, Thomas Dunne Books. St. Martin's
canceled and recalled the book after learning that the author, J.H.
Hatfield, was a convicted felon linked to a car bombing attempt on
his boss. Two days later, Talk magazine announced that Wallace
would be its new editorial director.
</P>
<P>
   Witte takes a much milder view of the entire contretemps: ``I
think it would be very hard to avoid a situation like that. That's
one of those situation where you would be blindsided. We don't
ordinarily do a criminal check on our authors. You try to check
into people's background as best you can.''

MICHAEL APTED: A VETERAN DIRECTOR, DELIGHTING IN OPPOSITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ There are odd juxtapositions in the career of any
filmmaker, particularly one who has been at it as long and
prolifically as Michael Apted. But it's hard to imagine an
alignment odder than the one that has encompassed Apted in the last
few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday ``42 Up,'' the latest installment in his popular
and highly regarded documentary series tracing the lives of more
than a dozen British men and woman in seven-year increments, opened
in the United States after a frustrating year during which Apted
searched and searched for a distributor. Two days later this
journeyman director, best known for finely wrought dramas often
featuring female protagonists, offered ``The World Is Not Enough'':
of all things, a James Bond movie, big and expensive and explosive,
full of stunts and action scenes and scantily clad women.
</P>
<P>
   The two don't seem to go together. It's like Abbott and Garbo.
And yet they must go together, or how else to explain Michael
Apted?
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been perfectly respectable, but this could
catapult me into a whole new category,'' said Apted, 58. If nothing
else, he said, if he has two successes at once, especially with
such disparate films, it might change the way some Hollywood power
brokers regard him. ``Can't make money, that Apted,'' he mimicked
with a sneer.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't saying that after the weekend. ``The World Is Not
Enough'' had an estimated weekend box office gross of $37.2
million. This not only put it in first place for the weekend (ahead
of Tim Burton's ``Sleepy Hollow'' with $30.5 million) but also made
it the highest opening ever for a James Bond film and the highest
opening for any movie ever released by MGM. Early box office
numbers for ``42 Up,'' which opened on only a handful of screens,
were not available, but the series has always done respectably in
big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Apted said, ``could jump-start my movie career,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Apted is tall, slender, disarmingly frank and a bit patrician in
manner. George Plimpton could play him in the movie. The
Buckinghamshire accent has mellowed a bit, probably from 19 years
of living in Southern California. ``I came here to do `Coal Miner's
Daughter,' and I just stayed, actually,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His filmmaking career began in 1964 when, with the backing of
the BBC and Granada Television, he embarked on what he thought
would be a one-time documentary about British 7-year-olds. In ``7
Up'' he drew children from a variety of social classes, interviewed
them about their lives and their aspirations and then photographed
them playing together, their modes of play unconsciously commenting
on their dreams and their classes.
</P>
<P>
   He saw it as a political statement, a commentary on the British
class system, and he was stunned when viewers saw something more.
Seven years later he followed up with ``Seven Plus Seven,''
catching up with the same children, now teenagers. It was an
enormous success in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so slow to realize that it had an appeal outside of
England,'' he said. ``I didn't realize what I had. I thought I was
making a statement about class, but what I really had was a study
about life.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He returned with ``21 Up,'' but not until ``28 Up'' in 1985 did
he get widespread distribution in the United States. Each
successive film has been incrementally more popular, and the series
has grown and mellowed with its subjects, sometimes taking on
almost heartbreaking resonance. By now, his 7-year-olds have begun
to settle into middle age and confront their mortality.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What Apted hadn't realized when he made the first of the series,
he said, was that he would some day require the participation of
those being interviewed to continue it. He neglected to get them to
sign contracts. Even now there are none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I have to go back to them and ask them to take part
again,'' he said. ``I have to put on my used car salesman bit. You
see, they hold all the cards. I want them in it, and I really don't
care what I do to keep them in it. And I always know that if I do
something naughty, they're out of it. So I really do have to
behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the subjects grow through awkward adolescence to
adulthood, some prospering, some not; being able to cut back to
shots of them as children full of young dreams: it has been more
than just a filmmaker's exercise for Apted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I find that I know them all well, and they are like my
family, in a way,'' he said. ``As they are getting older, the
difference in age between us seems less and less important, and the
whole fear of mortality is creeping in. It's really a frightening
thought, what I will do when the first of them dies. It didn't used
to worry me before. But now I have to face it. I only hope I go
first.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Apted said he had kept up with the series, even in years when he
could have been making much more money directing something else,
largely because of the response it had received. He was having a
salad during a round of interviews at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Beverly Hills, promoting the Bond film. Several dozen journalists
had already questioned him that morning, he said, and every one of
them brought up the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says to me, `Why do you still do it?''' Apted said.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly isn't for the money; the amount that he makes on
the ``Up'' series is a fraction of what a director earns on a
big-budget project like a James Bond movie. It is something else
that drives him to push on with the ``Up'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it because every single person I've talked to today has
mentioned it,'' Apted said. ``It's amazing how much people bring it
up. They all say, `How it is going to end?' I tell them, I don't
know. I'll keep going as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Which made his most recent struggle to find an American
distributor for ``42 Up'' so frustrating and perplexing, he said.
(First Run Features eventually picked it up.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody turned it down,'' he said. ``I mean, everybody. I
couldn't understand it. These films always do about a million
dollars. Always. It's as close to a guarantee as you can get. And
the films don't need to be marketed, outside of a few newspaper
ads. They're review-driven. There is no negative cost, just
publicity and advertising, and it's a guaranteed million dollars,
but nobody was interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The films in the series have always had their premieres on
television in England, where ``42 Up'' was shown in the summer of
1998. ``They would say to me, `Oh, the marketplace is too
crowded,''' Apted said. ``Then I think they realized that that Bond
film was coming out, and it might do well to release them close
together. Which I hope it does.''
</P>

<P>
   (MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In between his seven-year reunions, Apted became one of the most
prolific and versatile directors in Hollywood, though his films
have had spotty box-office success.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, his career breaks into seven-year segments, too.
Between ``7 Up'' and ``Seven Plus Seven,'' he struggled to
establish himself, mostly doing television series in Britain.
Between ``Seven Plus Seven'' and ``21 Up,'' he became a respected
director in Britain, with films like ``Stardust'' (1974) and the
cult favorite ``Triple Echo'' (1972).
</P>
<P>
   Not until between ``21 Up'' and ``28 Up'' did he make the move
to Hollywood, where his first real success was ``Agatha,'' a 1979
drama starring Dustin Hoffman and Vanessa Redgrave (as Agatha
Christie). The same period saw ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' which won
Sissy Spacek an Oscar in 1980, ``Continental Divide'' starring John
Belushi in 1981 and ``Gorky Park'' in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Then, between ``28 Up'' and ``35 Up'' came a series of uneven
efforts. Sigourney Weaver was an Oscar nominee for his ``Gorillas
in the Mist'' in 1988, and 1991's ``Class Action'' was well
received, but there was also ``Critical Condition,'' a critical and
box office dud in 1987. Between ``35 Up'' and ``42 Up'' he was
never quite able to match the critical successes of his earlier
work. There was ``Thunderheart'' in 1992, ``Nell'' in 1994 and
``Extreme Measures'' in 1996, among others. Then last year came the
call to tackle James Bond, the most endurable series in film
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Apted said. ``I think my agent
put my name up and they called back. I said to my agent: `Is this a
joke? Why would anyone like me be asked to do an action film?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, said the film's producers, Michael G. Wilson and
Barbara Broccoli, is that they wanted a director who could not only
choreograph big-screen stunts but also add dramatic weight to the
story. Pierce Brosnan, in his third outing as Ian Fleming's suave
superspy, particularly felt that the most recent Bond movie,
``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' tilted too far in the direction of one big
action scene after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this one, what I think we all wanted and what I think we
got,'' Brosnan said, ``is a greater attention to story and
character.'' He gives Apted much of the credit for that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Apted said, that initial contact did come as a bit of a
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pierce was really ready to make the series his,''
Apted said. ``He wanted his stuff in it. He said to me: `I want
something to do. Give me something to play.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Brosnan was eager to take more advantage of some of the
supporting players the series had under contract. ``He said, `My
Lord, we have Judi Dench, one of the greatest actresses in England;
let's use her,''' Apted said. Plus, the story line relied more
heavily on the female roles, and Apted had had some success
directing women. ``All of that made sense to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apted said he had never been a James Bond fan. His tastes as a
young man ran to Antonioni and Godard, not Terence Young (director
of the first two 007 films), he said. ``But I know the series'
place in England's cultural history,'' he said. ``I know that
what's being sold is a perception of what England is.''
</P>
<P>
   So all he had to do was reconcile himself to the necessities of
the genre _ ``the action, the babes, that's a given really, when
you get the job'' _ and try to figure out how to make huge and
involving action sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done action scenes before, but I'd never done anything
this huge scale and with so much depending on it,'' Apted said. ``I
worried: How can you come up with these ideas? How can you make
them fresh? And now that we have Austin Powers breathing down our
neck, we have to be very careful. We want to be in on the joke, we
don't want to be the joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately that was something to which everyone was sensitive,
he said, including Brosnan. ``They all live in fear of parodying
themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And it all turned out to be a great deal of fun. He wouldn't
mind doing it again, if they ask him back. Now all he has to do is
see whether, in the crowded weeks of the holiday movie season, the
Bond film continues to perform well at the box office. And perhaps
to remind people about that other, little film of his that's out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is quite a moment for me,'' Apted said. ``An
extraordinary opportunity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As he tries to fend off the biggest hostile
takeover attempt in history, the chief executive of Mannesmann AG
insisted Sunday that he was not looking for a rescue by a ``white
knight'' investor or by German political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter that should be left to the markets and to
shareholders,'' the executive, Klaus Esser, said in an interview
Sunday. ``There should be freedom to make offers. If the offer is
not attractive, the shareholder can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   That may or may not turn out to be the final result. On Friday,
after weeks of shadowboxing, Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain
appealed directly to Mannesmann shareholders with an offer to buy
their stock for $127.7 billion, to be paid in newly issued Vodafone
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the battle would control what amounts to a
European transcontinental wireless communications network, at a
time when mobile voice and data services are growing at torrid
rates across the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   But more than money is at stake. German political leaders and
labor unions have already expressed outrage at what they describe
as a crass, ``Anglo-Saxon'' bid to break a major German success
story.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, originally a giant in engineering and automotive
parts, has transformed itself into a powerful phone and wireless
telecommunications company. Vodafone said that it would spin off
the automotive and engineering operations _ as Mannesmann itself
plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Vodafone would also split off the fixed-line telephone
operations into a company with separate stock, while primarily
concentrating on the wireless communications business.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, by contrast, argues that its strategy is based on
integrating the fixed-line and wireless businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And while Esser pleaded Sunday against letting the battle
descend into a brawl over nationality, he also emphasized that his
primary goal for the last year has been to keep his company
independent _ come what may.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from his home in Duesseldorf, Esser said
he had feared a hostile takeover bid from Vodafone since January,
when Vodafone acquired Airtouch Communications of San Francisco in
a deal valued at around $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Airtouch deal gave Vodafone a 35 percent stake in
Mannesmann's German mobile telephone company, D2, as well as a 22
percent stake in Omnitel, the Italian wireless company in which
Mannesmann now owns a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   Esser said he had wanted at least a ``substantial minority
stake'' in Vodafone's British mobile-phone business and had
proposed expanding their cooperation in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready for a broader cooperation in Europe,'' he said
Sunday. ``They didn't want a broadening of cooperation on a parity
level. They didn't see us as a partner, but as a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's chief executive, Christopher Gent, has told a very
different story. At news conferences, Gent said that Vodafone was
eager to deepen its partnership with Mannesmann but was forced to
turn hostile when Mannesmann reached a deal last month to acquire
one of Vodafone's biggest rivals in Britain, Orange PLC.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the takeover fight marks a key test of Germany's
openness. German companies have made huge foreign acquisitions in
the last year, led by the Daimler-Benz acquisition of Chrysler
Corp. and Deutsche Bank's purchase of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   But German businesses have remained surprisingly resistant to
foreign acquisition, whether friendly or hostile. If Mannesmann
repels Vodafone with help from political leaders or from other
members of Germany's old industrial club, other European countries
are likely to respond with new barriers against German companies.
</P>
<P>
   Esser said Sunday that German politicians should not try to
interfere with Vodafone's offer, which is entirely legal under
German law.
</P>
<P>
   Esser is in a particularly delicate position, with Mannesmann's
deal still pending to buy Orange, Britain's third-largest wireless
carrier, for about $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And last summer, Mannesmann scored a big victory by lining up in
Italy behind Olivetti SpA's hostile takeover of Telecom Italia.
When Olivetti won control of Telecom Italia, it sold Mannesmann a
controlling stake in the Omnitel wireless network for about $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Against that wider background, Esser has framed most of his
arguments strictly in terms of shareholder benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, both Mannesmann and Vodafone will begin campaigns to
win the hearts and wallets of Mannesmann shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is offering to pay 240 euros a share, now $247.25, a
premium of nearly 20 percent over Mannesmann's current share price.
Esser will hammer home his argument that Vodafone offers nothing
that Mannesmann needs and that its bid is paltry compared with the
track record of Mannesmann's own shares, which have quadrupled in
value in the last three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vodafone's offer is being made entirely in stock _ something
that Esser has criticized. A German magazine reported at the
weekend that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was pushing for a new
European directive that would require cash payments. Schroeder had
said on Friday that hostile takeovers ``destroy corporate
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Esser said he would be opposed to political intervention.
``I don't think we should change the rules,'' he said. ``It should
be left to the market and to shareholders. There should be freedom
to make offers, and if an offer is not attractive, the shareholders
can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Esser has at least two credibility issues with shareholders. The
first is that Mannesmann's fixed-line telephone business is not yet
profitable and may not be for several years. The second is that
Mannesmann infuriated investors by agreeing to pay what many
consider too high a price for Orange.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Esser also insisted that he was not looking for a
``white knight'' _ a friendly investor or corporation that would
acquire a stake in Mannesmann and block Vodafone from winning
control.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Mannesmann did have ``substantial and
significant'' partnerships with Vivendi SA of France, which
controls that country's second-largest mobile-phone network as well
as other properties around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that has nothing to do with a defense strategy,'' Esser
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mannesmann chief executive also ruled out a ``Pac-Man''
strategy of making a reverse offer to take over Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely excluded,'' Esser said. ``The Mannesmann
portfolio is better than the Vodafone portfolio. If we did a
Pac-Man, we would make our shareholders end up with the same thing
that Vodafone would have made them end up with.''

PEPSI, FOLLOWING COKE, GOING UP IN PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following the trend set by Coca-Cola earlier this month, PepsiCo
plans to raise the price it charges its bottlers for concentrate by
nearly 7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase means that both soft-drink giants are committed to
a shift in strategy that rejects the volume-at-any-cost model that
has been in place the last three years in favor of improved profit
margins with less volume. Many investors have been confused by the
change in strategy, which came with little fanfare from the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi Bottling Group, the bottler that was spun off from PepsiCo
earlier this year, made the announcement on Friday. Consumers can
expect to pay an average of a cent more for each can of Pepsi, said
a spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky, although prices on individual
packages will rise at a far higher rate. Analysts said 12-packs of
cans, which had been selling for $1.99 in many supermarkets, will
rise to $2.49 or $2.79 after the increase takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a workable increase,'' Jabbonsky said, adding,
``PepsiCo's commitment to providing more aggressive marketing
support is absolutely key to the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase, which most industry analysts expected, will
translate into higher marketing-support payments to Pepsi bottlers
from PepsiCo. A PepsiCo spokesman would say only that marketing
support is ``negotiated individually with our bottlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an executive at Coca-Cola's largest bottler,
Coca-Cola Enterprises, told a gathering of analysts and investors
that Coke was raising concentrate prices by twice the usual rate.
Much of the increase is expected to pay for massive brand-marketing
programs that are intended to increase volume. Coke's concentrate
will cost bottlers 7 percent more next year than they were paying
at the beginning of this year, said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst for
Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, both systems need to improve margins and
improve the overall profitability of the category,'' said John
Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello added that he expected the concentrate price
increases to cause additional consolidation of Pepsi bottlers. Many
small bottlers will feel pressured to sell their businesses, he
wrote in a report to investors on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi spokesman, Richard Detwiler, said the two issues were
not connected. ``Consolidation is a process that has been under way
for quite some time, and this concentrate price increase is not
related to consolidation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For both Coke and Pepsi, the great unanswered question is
whether consumers attuned to paying very little for soft drinks can
be persuaded to pay more. A round of price increases at the retail
level this spring caused a drop-off in demand that has resulted in
layoffs and cutbacks in Coke's bottling operations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi Bottling announced on Friday that volume declines as a
result of price increases at the retail level earlier this year
were less drastic than expected. Instead of volume dropping off by
3 percent, it fell by 1 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pepsi system is starting to see positive volume trends,
and consumers are adjusting to what was sticker shock earlier in
the year,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens in the future is less certain. ``It's positive
for the industry,'' Pecoriello said, ``but it's not without risk.''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between Florida State (No. 1) and Virginia Tech (2), and
the difference between Alabama (3) and Nebraska (4) is much
smaller.

ADVERTISING: INTERNET COMPANY OFFERS CUSTOMIZED COMPUTER CURSORS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small Internet company is hoping that the adage about tall
oaks growing from little acorns also applies to cyberspace, as it
seeks big results from turning perhaps the tiniest place on a
computer screen into advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The company is Comet Systems in New York, which has developed a
proprietary technology for commercializing cursors, the arrows that
point and click their way through the Internet. On Web sites where
marketers have bought ad space, computer users who have installed
Comet software can be offered customized cursors.
</P>
<P>
   The Comet Cursors are colorful miniature billboards in fanciful
shapes that can range from Pokemon characters and Energizer bunnies
to telephone directories and ``Star Trek'' spaceships. They also
come in generic forms with themes like pets, holidays and sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Comet efforts are indicative of the so-called rich media
applications being introduced to increase interest in online
pitches, particularly the banner ads that tend to be as dull as,
well, arrow-shaped cursors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test of any rich-media product is how effective it is at
getting more customers and creating more brand awareness,'' said
Marissa Gouck, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to keep it something special,'' she added,
``because often, the more ubiquitous it becomes, the less effective
it becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Research by Millward Brown Interactive, a unit of the WPP Group,
that was commissioned by Comet and sponsored in part by four large
advertisers showed that differentiated cursors can significantly
increase the ability of computer users to recall seeing ad banners
and their desire to click through to read the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me that if the cursor could change contextually with
each site you visit, the advertising impression would remain with
you,'' said Jamie Rosen, recently promoted to chairman at Comet
from president, ``because it's a way of stamping a personality onto
a site.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen founded the company in 1997 with Dean Margolis, the chief
executive, who left during the summer, and Tom Schmitter, the chief
technical officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any new technology, the problem with putting an image in
the cursor space is one of education, getting people familiar and
comfortable with it,'' said Ben Austin, marketing director at
Comet. ``But invariably, every time we show it to people, they
become believers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comet technology is used on more than 55,000 Web sites, by
the company's count, with licensees that include AT&AMP;T Worldnet; the
Comedy Central cable network, jointly owned by Time Warner Inc. and
Viacom Inc.; Mattel; and the Warner Bros. Online unit of Time
Warner. Under an agreement signed last month with 24/7 Media in New
York, a product named the Cometized Banner, which automatically
serves branded cursors when an ad banner is clicked through, will
be delivered across the 24/7 ad network.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns with commercialized cursors have appeared on Web sites
operated by AltaVista, Lycos, theglobe.com and Yahoo, sponsored by
marketers like BellSouth, Energizer and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We incorporated the Comet Cursor into our own site,
Energizer.com,'' said Harriet Blickenstaff, a spokeswoman for the
Eveready Battery Company in St. Louis, a division of Ralston
Purina. ``It captures the fun and surprise of the bunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of driving people to the site, the results were
inconclusive,'' she added. ``But we would still deem it successful
because it fits our strategy, our tone, our spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of advertising in yet another Internet space could
generate a backlash among critics of the increasing commercialism
of communications, who could complain, to paraphrase the outcries
of the defeated villains in melodramatic old movies, ``Cursors,
foiled again!''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the nice thing about the Comet Cursor is that the user has
to make an active choice to get it,'' said Beth Suitt, advertising
manager of BellSouth Intelliventures in Atlanta, referring to the
need to download the software, known as a plug-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of an opt-in experience instead of being put in your
face without permission,'' she added. ``That gives advertisers an
opportunity to stick to users' minds without being intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The plug-in aspect can be a minus as well as a plus if users are
wary of the time it takes to download the Comet Cursor from sources
like www.cometsystems.com and www.cometzone.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay for the sins of our predecessors,'' Rosen said,
laughing, ``when people see a download and think it's going to
crash their computers.'' But Comet plugs the plug-in process as
brief, lasting less than 10 seconds. (If you try it late on a
Friday, when your computer is choking as colleagues file articles
on deadlines for Saturday, Sunday and Monday, it may take five
minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, by Comet's estimate, 15 million computer users have
downloaded the plug-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a neat little application that improves response rates
for advertisers,'' said Will Margiloff, advertising sales director
at theglobe.com in New York, which has developed promotions with
holiday themes using Comet Cursors. ``We'll continue to use it with
almost every promotion we do going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But can the commercialized cursor become more than just a
promotional ploy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a gimmicky aspect to it,'' Ms. Gouck at
Jupiter said. ``The approach Comet has is pretty good, but
technology can go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some great executions of the Comet Cursor and I've
seen some awful ones,'' she added. ``A lot depends on the creative
capabilities of the advertiser.''
</P>
<P>
   And Comet's technology initially proved more popular with
individual home pages and small-business sites than with marketing
giants. For example, none of the four large advertisers from the
Comet survey have used the technology so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased with the results,'' said Gretchen Briscoe, a
spokeswoman for one advertiser, Procter &AMP; Gamble in Cincinnati.
``The cursor drove awareness and people remembered the brand, but
we've got no plans going forward to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope P&AMP;G rethinks its reticence. Who wouldn't relish the
chance to see a Comet Cursor shaped like a can of Comet cleanser?

   WASHINGTON _ The cable television and consumer electronics
industries say they have finally solved a problem that has lingered
for more than 18 months as a serious impediment to digital TV.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, because solutions and agreements between these two
industries are seldom wholehearted, the two sides are still sniping
at each other over some of the details.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been agreeing on a way to connect digital cable
boxes to digital television sets, which is necessary if cable
subscribers are to watch the new-style, digital programming.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer electronics industry announced last week that
sufficient agreement had been reached over what sort of connections
should be used for set makers to begin building cable-compatible
digital televisions. The first such sets should reach the market a
year from now.
</P>
<P>
   But TV-set makers are not yet ready to commit themselves to
making all digital television sets ready for cable in the form the
cable industry would like, saying that some consumers may not want
or need that capability.
</P>
<P>
   Digital television offers crystal-clear, high-resolution
pictures and first-quality digital sound _ as well as the
possibility of interactivity and other advanced digital services
that have yet to be devised. The federal government is mandating
the transition to digital TV and hopes to complete it by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The cable-connection debate first arose early in 1998, just
before the start of digital-television services. The industries
realized that after a decade of development costing hundreds of
millions of dollars, this small but vital question had been
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Because two-thirds of the United States' television viewers
subscribe to cable, government officials quickly realized that
unless these people were able to watch digital broadcasts, the
government-mandated transition would fail. So in the summer of
1998, William Kennard, the Federal Communications Commission
chairman, urged the parties to resolve the problem by November of
that year.
</P>
<P>
   When the appointed time came, the industries announced that they
had come to an agreement, and everyone gave congratulations. But
they had solved only part of the problem. They had figured out what
kind of plug they wanted to use. But they had not agreed on a
method to keep viewers from making digital copies of programs that
the programmers did not want copied _ like pay-for-view movies.
Hollywood will not release movies in digital form without such
protection.
</P>
<P>
   It took another year for that debate and others to be settled,
leading to last week's announcement. But even then, Gary Shapiro,
headof the Consumer Electronics Association (formerly known as the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association) complained that the
cable industry was trying to load the agreement with requirements
that his members, the TV makers, do not want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to broaden the digital divide by forcing
Americans to pay more for every DTV set to get features they may
not want or use,'' he said. Industry estimates place the added cost
of the new connections at $100 or less for each television set.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the sort of plug that will be used. A year ago, the
industries agreed to use a plug that has come to be known as
Firewire and was first designed by Apple Computer. Besides the
video and audio portions of digital television fare, Firewire would
enable the reception of data and other information that might be
part of new types of interactive programming.
</P>
<P>
   Since agreeing upon Firewire, the cable industry has won
agreement from worldwide standard-setting bodies that this sort of
plug would serve as the connector between digital TV and the
digital cable box. The cable industry is requiring its members to
use the plug on all digital boxes starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Green, head of Cable Labs, the cable industry
organization that worked on the standard, said of the dispute with
the set makers: ``We have a pretty wide consensus on this; we
really have addressed the cable compatibility problem. We've done
what we think is right. But if they don't want to use it, they
don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Milbourn, a senior executive with Thomson Consumer
Electronics, maker of the RCA and Proscan brands of TV, said he
assumed cable companies would eventually want to offer a
lower-priced option on their cable boxes, too, ``because cable
would want to market these new services _ not only to new digital
sets but also, more importantly, to the installed base of over 250
million regular TV sets as well.''

   Bias Suit Against CNN Dismissed

<P>
   A federal judge in New York has dismissed a discrimination suit
against CNN before trial. Art Browne, a senior editor in the
network's New York office, contended that he was fired after 16
months on the job because of his age _ he was 59 when he was hired

<P>
   The federal government is going to get a respectable report card
when the House subcommittee tracking Year 2000 preparations issues
what it calls its final grades Monday. But the subcommittee has
decided not to issue grades for more than 40 vital government

   Credibility Code Meets Resistance
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's growing lack of credibility among consumers is
beginning to draw more attention. Two organizations _ one
grass-roots, the other representing industry _ have announced their
intentions to bring some balance to a debate that has been lopsided
toward unfettered growth at any cost. But it seems that the
Internet economy is far more willing to risk consumer rejection
than to voluntarily adopt a code of conduct or to reveal too much
about how it conducts business.

   Software Tool Seeks Low Prices
</P>
<P>
   Web users who like to comparison shop no longer have to click to

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATORS INTENT ON ROUTING CORRUPTION FROM BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Suspect that bankers may have illegally
profited from Brazil's currency devaluation last January? Convene a
congressional investigation to look into it. Worried about
organized crime? Order a second legislative inquiry. Fearful of
corruption in the judiciary? Get yet another committee to examine
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere Brazilians turn these days, one parliamentary
commission of inquiry or another seems to be investigating some
form of official misconduct. What is more, many of these CPIs,
known by their Portuguese initials, are actually yielding results _
forcing policy changes and unmasking offenders and sending them to
court.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the judiciary, for instance, has concluded
that much of the $300 million in cost overruns in the construction
of a still unfinished labor-relations court complex in Sao Paulo
ended up in the pockets of the presiding judge and one of his
friends, Sen. Luiz Estevao. Though prosecutors had tried
unsuccessfully for years to uncover such evidence, a Senate panel
used its broader powers to compile a dossier in only a few weeks
that was strong enough to order the indictment of both men last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, part of the spate of high-profile investigative
activity is pure politics. With municipal elections scheduled for
next year and campaigning already getting under way, the country's
political parties, more than 20 in all, are eager to get publicity
for potential candidates and to appear to be defending the
interests of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``These CPIs are very interesting to watch on television because
they always make a lot of noise,'' said Nilton de Oliveira Motta, a
skeptical bus driver here. ``I am not sure, though, how much is
real and how much is just fireworks to impress us voters.''
</P>
<P>
   But the focus on exposing and punishing wrongdoing also reflects
a basic shift of attitude among Brazilians, rejecting impunity and
demanding accountability. In a country where the governor of a
major state once adopted the slogan ``he steals, but he gets things
done'' during a successful re-election campaign, the population
nowadays is both less tolerant of corruption and official
wrongdoing and better equipped to root it out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the military dictatorship that ruled this nation of 165
million people from 1964 to 1985, civilian institutions _ whether
elected officials, lawyers or the press _ had only limited ability
to poke into suspicious matters of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the new constitution that went into effect in 1988
encouraged such exercises, and the credibility of the commissions
of inquiry was strengthened after one investigation and an ensuing
impeachment trial on corruption charges led to the resignation of
President Fernando Collor de Mello in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the Senate alone has started 29 inquiries into
matters as diverse as child labor and wasteful spending in the
country's nuclear energy program. According to the Brazilian
chapter of the anti-corruption group Transparency International,
nearly 40 more such inquiries have been taking place just this year
at the state and municipal level, looking into matters ranging from
malfeasance in Sao Paulo to racism in Bahia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country seems to be learning to show its blemishes and
denounce its scandals, something that was not done'' in an earlier
era, Zuenir Ventura, a prominent writer and columnist, wrote
earlier this month in O Globo, the main daily newspaper here.
``Today nothing is hidden, everything is made manifest,'' he added,
and while ``that is more disagreeable, it is nevertheless
healthier.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Compared with their U.S. equivalents, congressional inquiries
here are more powerful, endowed with certain tools that are even
denied prosecutors. They can and have decreed the arrest of
suspected wrongdoers and ordered supposedly confidential bank, tax,
credit card and telephone records opened.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these committees ``have been extremely successful
in uncovering corruption and especially in producing hard and
quality evidence sufficient to indict and convict the offender,''
said David Fleischer, the president of Transparency International's
Brazilian branch. The organized crime investigation, he added,
``has already bared more in three months than the government has in
20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the current round of inquiries will end is not clear. One
member of the lower house of Congress has already been expelled for
involvement in drug trafficking, as have several state legislators
and city council members around the country. And a recommendation
was made to the Senate last week that Estevao be impeached on
grounds of illicit enrichment and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But the target of another inquiry, the Supreme Court, has been
feeling ``increasingly uncomfortable'' and has retaliated with
``several controversial decisions attempting to curtail the
investigative powers of Congress,'' Fleischer noted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``because the public opinion outcry was so harsh,'' he
added, ``the high court has had to back down and reverse those
restrictions.''

<P>
   ``CRYING: THE NATURAL &AMP; CULTURAL HISTORY OF TEARS'' &QL; 
By Tom Lutz (Norton, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only humans sob. Weeping is a peculiarity of man _ no other
animals are known to do it. And yet we know surprisingly little
about it, other than the obvious (children cry more than adults do)
and the physiological (reflex tears _ those you produce when you
peel an onion _ have a different chemical composition from
emotional tears). Crying is an escape, a physical act that
distracts us from the trauma that has made us cry. It is also, Lutz
tells us, a kind of language, ``expressing not just our distress
but our demands, not just our desire to be understood but our
desire to evade detection. Our crocodile tears can be used to
ensnare, to confuse, to extort, to deceive. Even those tears we cry
when we are alone have an imagined audience. Even in our deepest
moments of grief, we can be well aware of the effect our tears are
having on those around us.'' This vastly researched,
interdisciplinary study of tears is a delight, in the tradition of
Diane Ackerman's ``A Natural History of the Senses.'' Lutz looks at
how philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists and sociologists
have interpreted tears over the years. He looks at crying in art
and literature, film and advertisement. He explores the physical
process of crying and its psychological benefits, as well as gender
issues that it raises (powerful women such as Hillary Rodham
Clinton do not cry in public because it could be read as weakness).
He discusses our changing attitudes toward tears, illustrated by
the fact that Edmund Muskie was run out of the 1972 presidential
primary race for crying in front of reporters, whereas Bob Dole,
who remained dry-eyed for the first 40 years of his public life,
cried many times over the past decade without consequence. Finally,
Lutz poses another puzzle: Even if we think we know why we cry, can
we explain why we stop? ``Tears,'' he writes, ``are the most
substantial and yet the most fleeting, the most obvious and yet the
most enigmatic proof of our emotional lives.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LADIES AUXILIARY'' &QL; 
By Tova Mirvis (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This compassionate first novel is the story of the women of an
Orthodox Jewish community in Memphis, Tenn., and their relationship
with a free-spirited woman _ a convert to Judaism _ who comes to
live among them. Batsheva is the widow of Benjamin Jacobs, who has
been killed in a car crash in New York. Hoping to ease her
loneliness and preserve her ties to him, Batsheva brings their
5-year-old daughter to the Memphis community in which Benjamin grew
up. From the start, it's obvious to the other women that Batsheva
does not fit in _ she does not cook or clean, nor does she pay
suitable attention to the modesty of her clothing or to the
dictates of Jewish tradition. But she does bring an understated
self-confidence, a passion for delving into the questions that
religious faith inspires, and a sympathy for the community's young
people, who crave freedom from the obligations to which they were
born. Mirvis tells her story in the collective voice of the Jewish
ladies, a ``we'' that reflects the depth of their traditions, the
vulnerability of those traditions in the modern world and the
oppressive standards that have grown up around them. Mirvis never
loses her compassion for these characters, nor does she ignore the
value of their moral and religious commitments. They are gossipy
and judgmental, yet oddly innocent. And in coming to terms with
their feelings about Batsheva, the women begin to question
themselves. This is a gentle story _ no sex, violence or overt
drama _ written with a deft hand and a sympathetic heart. Mirvis,
who grew up in the Memphis community on which her novel is based,
says her novel is ``emotionally autobiographical.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MISS MANNERS' GUIDE TO DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY''By Judith Martin
(Crown, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The formidable arbiter of taste and tactics turns her eyes to
the home front, where civility often meets the fate of a dead
goldfish. She begins, of course, with the ticklish affairs of the
people of the home front, known as ``The Family.'' This chapter is
so complex, given today's divorce and remarriage statistics, that
New &AMP; Notable had to take notes just to keep up. But Miss Manners
has everything under control. Other headings include ``The Help,''
``The Visitors'' and ``Entertaining the Relatives.'' Our favorite
parts are not Miss Manners' essays on these matters, but the
questions she receives from her gentle readers and the answers she
gives, in which she shows herself capable of gutting a cloddish
correspondent without even a trace of discourtesy. We love Miss
Manners, yes we do. We would suggest, however, that she has written
many books (12); that the overlap is conspicuous; that being
content with one's already considerable fortune is a gracious thing
indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LIKELY STORY'' &QL; 
By Rosemary Mahoney (Anchor, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Miss Manners would wring her hands over Rosemary Mahoney.
There is no civility in this memoir (now new in paperback) of the
summer of 1978, when the 17-year-old Mahoney worked as a domestic
for the woman she thought was her idol, Lillian Hellman. Hellman
was irascible, insulting, bossy, cheap and pathetic. Mahoney was a
teenager, and so not much more pleasant than her employer. The
difference is that Hellman is dead and Mahoney is alive to tell the
tale. Neither woman looks good, although it is Hellman who suffers
the indignity of having her 73-year-old body described through the
eyes of an angry young girl. This is what Miss Manners would
whisper in Rosemary Mahoney's ear: Someday, you will be old. &QL;

GATES FOUNDATION DONATES $26 MILLION TO FIGHT TETANUS ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An American support group for Unicef, the U.N. children's fund,
announced Sunday that it has received its largest donation ever, a
grant of $26 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
earmarked for the elimination of tetanus among babies and their
mothers in the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 250,000 people, most of them infants, died of tetanus in
the developing world in 1998, according to the U.S. Committee for
Unicef, the American support group and the oldest of Unicef's 37
national support committees. Only one newborn infant died of
tetanus in the United States in the same year, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   The grant from the foundation, which was created by Gates, the
chairman and co-founder of the Microsoft Corp., is intended to make
immunizations more widely available to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps us close the gap between what we are capable of doing
in the world and what we are actually going to do,'' said Charles
J. Lyons, president of the U.S. committee. The money will be turned
over to Unicef for its programs abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unicef and others have strategies for dealing with neonatal
tetanus,'' Lyons, a former Unicef official, said in an interview on
Thursday. ``We're down to 57 countries, 27 of which account for 90
percent of cases. But there was no movement on that because the
resources weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to eliminate neonatal tetanus received its first
pledge of assistance in 1998 from Becton, Dickinson &AMP; Co., a
leading maker of syringes, which offered donations of equipment and
some funds. The Gates grant, Lyons said, is expected to prompt more
donations because people like to be part of a demonstrably
successful project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is much of a limit on people's interest
and willingness to give, but they want to see results; they want to
see lasting results,'' he said. Unicef says that its campaign can
effectively eliminate neonatal tetanus as a health hazard if the
organization can raise $100 million to inoculate 100 million women
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said that the Gates grant, which follows grants to several
U.N. projects from Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation, reflects a growing
interest in development among companies that want to expand their
business abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at this very interesting stage historically,'' he said.
``I don't believe that the private sector is giving more in terms
of international development because government funding is being
reduced. I think the private sector is much more engaged because
their own vested interests are touched. There are more and more
companies that are operating in more and more countries where they
want to grow. Countries where we're still dealing with maternal and
neonatal tetanus include India, China, parts of Southeast Asia,
parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Companies see this as part of their
growth strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers in poor nations become infected by the tetanus bacteria
through unsterilized gynecological procedures or unsanitary
conditions surrounding childbirth. Babies can be infected when the
umbilical cord is cut, Unicef experts say. Death can be tortured,
with spasms, stiffness and the loss of the ability to breathe.
Inoculation protects both the mother and her newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the tetanus campaign and on the disease itself is
available on the U.S. Committee for Unicef's Web site:

SURVEY FINDS RESISTANCE TO E-SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES  
 ON THE DIGITAL EDGE WITHOUT VIDEOS OR ICE CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Wash.)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.)

<P>
   Merchants with high hopes for peddling cashmere and embroidered
denim jeans on the Web this season and into the future may be in
for a shock. Nearly half the Internet users in a recent survey said
they never planned to buy clothing online, according to NPD, a
market-research company based in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, this aversion to making clothing purchases on the
Web extends not only to Internet users who have never bought
clothing online but even to those users with years of experience,
NPD said. More than 40 percent of experienced Web users in the
survey _ many of whom had bought a fashion item online and had a
good experience _ said they would avoid buying apparel on the Web
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting up a yellow flag here,'' said Mike Hand,
president of NPD apparel services. ``We thought apparel would be
$13 billion a year by 2003 on the Web, which is the equivalent of
catalog. Now I don't think it is going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is based on information collected online in
August from a sample of 2,399 people selected as representative of
the United States' Web users, found that consumers' reservations
about buying apparel online have been difficult to overcome.
Eighty-five percent of those polled for the NPD study said they
were concerned about not being able to try on the clothing before
buying it; return policies were an issue for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far the retailers that are most successful at receiving
online sales are specialty sites that focus just on clothing, like
Gap.com or LandsEnd.com, according to NPD. Sites like Comcast's
QVC.com or Federated's Macys.com, which have many product
categories, may attract more visitors. But nearly three-quarters of
consumers polled for the study said they had made their most recent
online apparel purchase at a specialty site.
</P>
<P>
   The study also supported the growing notion that the Web might
be most effective as an adjunct to _ not a replacement for _
brick-and-mortar selling. Almost half the online buyers said their
most recent purchase of clothing from the Internet was made in
addition to purchases made off line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is hardly stealing apparel sales away from
traditional stores,'' Hand said. ``To the contrary, one of the main
reasons for buying clothing online, besides convenience, is because
consumers cannot find the items in regular stores.''

   A Night on the Digital Edge Without Videos or Ice Cream
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a simple enough way to spend a Saturday night in New
York: cross the new frontier in digital home delivery by ordering
two videos and a pint of ice cream from Kozmo.com, the Web site
that has reaped abundant publicity by promising to zip videos to
your doorstep in under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6:45 p.m. on Nov. 13, Kozmo's home page had a notice
saying the site would be down until 8 p.m. for an upgrade. New York
consumers rarely get what they want on the first try anyway, so it
seemed natural to try UrbanFetch.com, a new, competing digital
delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   UrbanFetch sent an e-mail whizzing right back saying that ``L.A.
Confidential,'' ``The Americanization of Emily'' and a pint of
Starbucks Coffee Vanilla Cashew Crunch would arrive between 7 and 8
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But when 8:30 passed without videos _ but with visions of soupy
ice cream _ a phone query seemed in order. The UrbanFetch
customer-service man said that Kozmo's problems meant that his
company was deluged with orders and was having trouble meeting
demand. But no need to worry: The videos had been dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   A quick check of Kozmo.com, meanwhile, found a new notice saying
that the site would be down until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   When the UrbanFetch order had not arrived by 10:30 p.m., an
attempt to cancel by telephone and e-mail got no immediate
response. The delivery man eventually materialized around 10:50
p.m., some four hours after the order had been placed. He wasn't
admitted to the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't strive to run our business this way,'' Ross
Stevens, the chief executive for UrbanFetch.com, wrote in an
unsolicited e-mail that arrived the next day. ``The reality is that
during this start-up phase, a small percentage of our orders are
handled in a less than perfect manner, and unfortunately your order
fell into that small group.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are chary about releasing specific numbers, so
the scale of the jumble is unclear. But Alison Bloom, a spokeswoman
for Kozmo.com, said that Saturday-night customers usually generated
from 1,000 to 1,500 orders and upward. Mary Maselli, a spokeswoman
for UrbanFetch, would say only that its orders doubled on Nov. 13
and that the usual standard of 99 percent of deliveries meeting the
one-hour delivery deadline had been lower that night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kozmo.com upgrade, which had begun at 3 a.m. that Saturday,
was finally completed the next day. Joseph Park, Kozmo.com's chief
executive, said the company gave $5 discount coupons to more than
10,000 customers who tried to log on from the cities it serves:
Boston, New York, Washington, San Francisco and Seattle. The
upgrade was designed to ease the flow of orders on the single Web
site that handles all five cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably a trying thing for some of our customers to go
to Blockbuster to rent a video,'' Park said. ``They really depend
on us for delivery in under an hour.''

EXCITE(AT)HOME TO SEPARATE CABLE AND CONTENT DIVISIONS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Under pressure from investors to clarify its
business strategy, Excite(AT)Home has decided to draw a distinction
between its Internet access business and its media-content business
by creating a separate tracking stock for the media assets, the
company said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would file the necessary documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the first half of next year
and distribute the new stock in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company was created in May by the merger of Web company
Excite and the At Home Corp., a cable Internet-access company. At
the time of the merger, its stock was trading around $63 but has
sunk as low as the mid-30s in August. On Friday, the shares closed
at $52.3125, up $2.125.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Excite(AT)Home said the tracking stock was meant
to signal that the company saw a difference between the information
content and Internet access portions of its business. AT&AMP;T, which
is Excite(AT)Home's largest investor, has a 26 percent equity stake
in a class of shares that gives it a 56 percent voting stake. AT&AMP;T
has persistently signaled discomfort at the coupling of the content
and cable business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an overhang on the stock that is the result of
speculation about the outcome of our discussions on the strategic
direction of company,'' Thomas A. Jermoluk, chairman and chief
executive of Excite(AT)Home, said in an interview Sunday. ``We
believe we have achieved strategic alignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk said the decision was not a precursor to a more formal
spinoff of the media assets into a separate company. In fact, he
noted that SEC rules would preclude such a spinoff for several
years, once the company issued a tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   Excite(AT)Home presently receives 65 percent of its revenue from
its media assets, which includes the Excite Web portal available to
anyone on the Internet; a high-capacity (AT)Home Web portal for
cable subscribers; MatchLogic, a direct marketing company and
Enliven, a multimedia advertising company. The balance of the
revenue comes from subscription fees from cable Internet-access
customers, of which it had 840,000 at the end of the third quarter.
The company's third-quarter revenue of $112.6 million slightly
exceeded analysts' forecasts, and was nearly double revenue of
$57.8 million in last year's third quarter. Excite(AT)Home lost
$498.6 million in the most recent quarter, largely as it took
charges associated with the merger.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, the company expects to see a shift in the balance of
its revenue, with 45 percent coming from the media assets.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision to issue the tracking stock, reached last
Wednesday, comes against a backdrop of uncertainty and a
fast-changing marketplace for Excite(AT)Home. In 2002, exclusive
contracts will begin to expire with AT&AMP;T, Cox and Comcast, which
until then are obliged to use Excite(AT)Home for the cable-modem
services offered on their cable television systems. Cox and Comcast
each own 8 percent of Excite(AT)Home. AT&AMP;T has already said that it
would consider opening its systems to competing Internet access
providers once the Excite(AT)Home contract expires. AT&AMP;T has faced
a heavy lobbying effort on that issue by a coalition of Internet
access providers, including America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk asserted that the media side of the business was moving
so quickly that a separate tracking stock would put the company in
a better position to react to competitive changes. The tracking
stock, he said, might be used for making acquisitions of other
media businesses without diluting the shares representing the
Internet-access cable business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be competitive in the world of the Net we need to
be able to move quickly, and to have a full range of strategic
options,'' Jermoluk said. ``One of the key reasons for the
structure is that it allows us to pursue all options without
diluting the interests of our cable partners.''

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

   CLINTON-FOREIGN _ FLORENCE, Italy _ When he journeys on Tuesday
to Kosovo, President Clinton will be highlighting one of the
riskiest and most troublesome ventures of his presidency. In
Kosovo, as in neighboring Bosnia, Clinton has sent Americans into
combat, committed troops to a long-term peacekeeping operation, and
spent billions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars to end Europe's bloodiest
conflicts since World War II. His quest to bring peace to the
Balkans, though, is but one of a half dozen loose foreign policy
strings Clinton is scrambling to tie together in his remaining year
in office. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   MEDICARE _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Elinor and Howard C. Poff had heard
about the hassles people go through when their Medicare HMO pulls
out, so they were glad at first that PacifiCare Health Systems was
staying in Warren County. They had no idea their hassles would be
worse because PacifiCare didn't drop them. ``Howard's not losing
his insurance. He's just losing his doctors,'' Elinor said. When
PacifiCare decided to stop providing its HMO Jan. 1 to 4,000
Medicare beneficiaries in Montgomery and Clark counties, it also
disbanded the physician networks there. ``They said he was going to
have to go to Hamilton or Wilmington or Cincinnati with all his
problems,'' Elinor said. But the Poffs live in Franklin, near the
Montgomery County line, and Howard's glaucoma keeps him from
driving. Millions of Americans will find themselves in predicaments
like Poff's on Jan. 1, with a Medicare HMO that no longer resembles
the one they joined but without the realistic option of returning
to Original Medicare and buying a supplemental ``Medi-gap'' policy
to fill the many holes in that coverage. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News)

A SECOND HEAD-BASHING ATTACK IS REPORTED IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His jaw is no longer wired shut and his shattered
fingers are beginning to move again, but Kent Gasser's face still
bears signs of a merciless beating he survived six weeks ago in
Riverside Park when a stranger bashed his head with a rock in the
middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lingering double vision, a damaged right hand and a
crooked nose, Gasser said he is almost ready to return to his
acting career _ and his job as a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it could have been a lot worse,'' said Gasser, 38, who
spent three days incoherent and unidentified before co-workers
tracked him down at a hospital in Harlem. ``The guy thought he had
finished me off.''
</P>
<P>
   The beating of Gasser has a few elements in common with the case
of Nicole Barrett, the 27-year-old woman who was hit on the head
with a paving stone in midtown last week, but the police are
reluctant to link the two attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Gasser insists that the police sketch of Ms. Barrett's attacker
strongly resembles the man who smashed him in the head and face on
Sept. 30 as he rehearsed lines in the park for an upcoming play.
``I've gone through thousands of mug shots, and this is the first
guy who looks like him,'' Gasser said. ``I will never ever forget
that face.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators noted that Gasser recalls his assailant as
being more than 6 feet tall; witnesses to the assault on Ms.
Barrett say the attacker was 6 inches shorter. Investigators say
the discrepancy makes it unlikely the two cases are related.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gasser's encounter with random brutality, his painstaking
but steady recovery and his zeal to return to life in New York
offer hints of the road faced by Ms. Barrett, who remained in
critical condition Sunday at Bellevue Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her case is more complicated, because she suffered a brain
injury; Gasser did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those crazy, out-of-the-blue things that's
shaken my life out, but I still love the city,'' Gasser said from
his family's home in Salt Lake City, where he plans to stay until
early January. ``I don't blame New York.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a Thursday afternoon, warm and sunny, when Gasser
strolled from his apartment at Broadway and 151st Street to a spot
in the park where he often went to memorize and recite lines. The
opening of ``The Blur,'' at the Pulse Ensemble Theater on West 42nd
Street, in which Gasser had a leading role, was three weeks away.
It would have been his first off-Broadway role.
</P>
<P>
   The park was relatively empty, but Gasser said he was not
concerned when a man with a lazy eye and 4-inch dreadlocks
approached and asked for spare change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give out quarters all the time,'' he said, ``but I honestly
had no money in my pockets, so I said `Sorry' and kept walking.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, as Gasser entered a more secluded area near
148th Street, his head buried in his script, a rock hit him in the
back of the head. He was dragged into a ditch, he said, and when he
opened his eyes he was face to face with the same man.
</P>
<P>
   The man's expression was full of fury. ``You have five seconds
to change your mind,'' he recalled the man saying, his arm cocked,
the rock poised above his face. Gasser repeated that he had no
money.
</P>
<P>
   Then the beating began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   As he held up his hands to block the first blows, Gasser
remembers seeing his fingers and wrists shatter and go limp. When
he tried to scream, the rock smashed his teeth and jaw, silencing
him.
</P>
<P>
   Unconsciousness followed, although doctors said the pounding
continued for some time afterward. Three hours later, a passer-by
found Gasser's inert body and called the police. He briefly
regained consciousness in an ambulance and sensed the half-dozen
teeth that had collected at the back of his throat. ``I remember
thinking, `I don't want to swallow my teeth,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three days, he remained semiconscious, in critical
condition. After he failed to show up for his job as a waiter at
City Grill, his boss tracked him down at St. Luke's Hospital, where
he had been admitted as John Doe.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of operations, his face and hands have been
reconstructed. Eight metal plates and 29 screws keep his features
in place; still other hardware fuses together his splintered hands.
``I'm really screwed up,'' Gasser said with a laugh. At other times
during the conversation, however, he was overcome with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, after weeks of intravenous feeding, Gasser's jaw
was unwired, enabling him to speak and eat solid foods again.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He's dealing with a lot of anger and depression, but thank
heaven he doesn't have any neurological damage,'' said his sister,
Linda Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his health problems, Gasser has financial ones related to
the attack. He has no health insurance and faces more than $50,000
in medical bills. His play, ``The Blur,'' opened and closed without
him, but his boss at the City Grill has promised to hold open his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have no leads and have yet to find any
witnesses. The attack received no media attention. Gasser is
convinced he will spot his assailant one day. ``It's not just
revenge I crave,'' he said. ``I just want to stop him from doing
this to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits to feeling jumpy on the street but is eager to return
to the city he adopted two years ago, when he and a group of
friends from the University of Utah started a small theater company
in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's life,'' he said of the attack. ``You have to roll with
the punches and do the best you can do.''

CANDIDATES' BIOGRAPHIES SOMETIMES REVEAL MORE THAN INTENDED 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although America doesn't have a lot of
writers-turned-politicians like Vaclav Havel or even
politician-writer hyphenates like Churchill or Disraeli, it's the
rare candidate today who hasn't chosen to promote himself by
promoting a book.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the leading candidates for the Democratic and Republican
presidential nominations _ Bill Bradley, Al Gore, John McCain,
George W. Bush and Steve Forbes _ is a published author. And while
the qualities that make a good autobiographical book _ candor,
originality of expression and what Edward Gibbon called ``naked,
unblushing truth'' _ are not exactly qualities associated with
politicians in this age of spin, there are revealing self-portraits
to be found between the lines. In fact, the contenders' own words
not only ratify popular impressions of them, but also provide
inadvertent glimpses of the personalities behind the personas.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the author of four books, comes across as a
solitary, faintly melancholy observer _ a kind of Nick Carraway,
thoughtfully ruminating on the people and events around him, be it
an NBA locker room (in ``Life on the Run'') his 1976 account of his
years as a New York Knick) or the chambers of the Senate (in his
1996 memoir, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' both from Vintage). He is
the privileged outsider _ the banker's son in a small town, the
Princeton grad on the Knicks _ who would like to prove himself one
of the guys; the methodical grind, who practices and practices
until he masters his craft; an intensely private man, whose
celebrity as an athlete made him wary, early on, of the press.
</P>
<P>
   His style as a writer and politician mirrors that of his play on
the court: low-key, industrious and analytic, relying on hard work
more than sheer natural gifts. Just as he used to break down every
shot in practice, so he now tries to break down issues, ideas and
his own beliefs. ``The examined life,'' he writes, ``has become one
of my ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore emerges from ``Earth in the Balance''
(Plume), his 1992 book about the environment, as the quintessential
A-student, who has belatedly discovered New Age psychobabble. Like
his speeches, his book veers between detailed policy assessments
(predictably illustrated with lots of charts and graphs) and
high-decibel outbursts of passion, between energetically researched
historical disquisitions and loony asides about ``inner ecology''
and ``spiritual triangulation'' _ asides that may help explain his
curious affinity with his feminist consultant, Naomi Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   One of his book's main themes concerns the mind-body dichotomy
and the perils of a ``disembodied intellect,'' and yet strangely
mechanistic images repeatedly surface in its pages. In one chapter,
he describes the Constitution as ``a blueprint for an ingenious
machine that uses pressure valves and compensating forces to
achieve a dynamic balance between the needs of the individual and
the needs of the community.'' In another, he argues that people
divide most tasks into ``two conceptual halves'' and ``assign each
half to opposite sides of the machine our body resembles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At breakfast this morning,'' Gore writes, ``I consolidated my
grapefruit with my left hand to keep it from moving on the plate
and then manipulated it with my right hand, first by cutting
portions away from the whole with a knife, then by eating them with
a spoon.''
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's style in ``Faith of My Fathers'' (Random House) is
decidedly more free-wheeling and heartfelt, employing a
pre-Hemingway vocabulary of words like ``honor'' and ``nobility,''
and a novelist's descriptive powers to evoke the insular, highly
ritualized world of naval officers that his parents and
grandparents inhabited. In this family memoir, written with his
administrative assistant, Mark Salter, McCain _ a senator from
Arizona _ is the rebellious son, who still loyally upholds his
family's tradition of military service; the insolent scamp who goes
to Vietnam in search of adventure and learns a new ``seriousness of
purpose'' during a harrowing five and a half years as a prisoner of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of fate and predestination recurs throughout his
book. McCain writes that as a boy, he accepted his eventual
enrollment at the Naval Academy as ``an immutable fact of life''
(even though he daydreamed about enrolling at Princeton); that as a
POW, he learned that fatalism ``was the best attitude you could
hold under the circumstances''; and that in recent years, he has
learned not to ``err out of self-doubt or to alter a fate I felt
had been imposed on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his temper, which has been the subject of recent news
reports, McCain writes that as a child his tantrums were sometimes
so bad that his parents would dunk him in a tub of cold water to
try to teach him self-restraint. Later, as a POW, he writes,
resisting and being uncooperative ``proved, as it had in the past,
to be a morale booster for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for George W. Bush's new book ``A Charge To Keep'' (William
Morrow and Co.), which was largely ghost-written by his
communications director, Karen Hughes, it is the least
idiosyncratic, least revealing volume of the lot. Basically a
padded version of Bush's standard stump speech written to compete
with Bush biographies by other writers, the book has the
perfunctory tone of a ``what I did over my summer vacation''
assignment. It draws a careful self-portrait of an outgoing fellow,
who easily makes friends and jokes and decisions _ a man who has
``always looked for the lighter side of life,'' but who found real
meaning in deciding to ``recommit my heart to Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Bush eschews the mangled syntax of his
father, sticking to simple platitudes and cliches, but he, too, has
a way with the bizarre image. In one chapter, he writes that he
pursued the purchase of the Texas Rangers baseball team ``like a
pit bull on the pant leg of opportunity''; in another, he writes
that a ``gap of hope threatens the very fabric of America.'' Firmly
in the staying-on-message mode, he gives few glimpses in these
pages of his acerbic wit, so well known to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas governor's book seems calculated to keep him
from losing ground, Steve Forbes' dry new book ``A New Birth of
Freedom'' (Regnery Publishing) seems designed to establish his
political credentials, to show that he cares not only about the
flat tax, but about education, Social Security and defense, too.
Forbes tries hard in this volume to depict himself as a regular
guy, not a publishing scion with a net worth of $440 million. He
writes about how his grandfather came to this country with
``practically no money'' and talks about summer vacations in the
``family station wagon.'' The ``About the Author'' note at the end
of this humor-free book points out that Forbes ``has guest-hosted
`Saturday Night Live' and appeared on `The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno' and `The Late Show With David Letterman.'''
</P>
<P>
   The books by Bush and McCain show indifferent students and
good-time boys with quick tempers, gradually embracing
responsibility and duty _ prodigal sons who eventually took up
their fathers' mantle. Bush coyly alludes to having been ``the life
of the party'' before giving up drinking shortly after his 40th
birthday. McCain, with considerably more candor, writes of being a
``hell-raiser,'' who, with friends, enjoyed a reputation ``for
hosting the most raucous and longest beach parties of any squadron
in the Navy.'' The word ``toga,'' as in ``toga party,'' pops up in
both Republicans' books.
</P>
<P>
   The young Bradley and Gore, in contrast, come across as policy
wonks in the making _ conscientious, eager-to-please boy scouts,
who worked hard in school, and had to work harder, in middle age,
to get in touch with their feelings. Gore's demeanor has been
compared to that of a cigar store Indian; Bradley compares his own
abilities as a public speaker to the ``skills of an inmate of
Madame Tussaud's wax museum.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Bradley writes, he had been impressed ``by Aesop's
fable about the ant who, unlike the grasshopper, confronted the
winter prepared, because it had spent its summer working instead of
playing.'' Even on the basketball court, he played with detachment,
only gradually allowing himself to express emotion. In high school,
he writes, ``the ascetic side of my personality, with its
Westminster Catechism foundation and its sports discipline, had
hardened into a steely conviction that only with hard work,
complete self-control and careful study would I even have a chance
of coming closer to the distant God that ruled the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his near defeat in the 1990 Senate election in New Jersey,
Bradley says, he had ``not waded into turbulent waters by defining
my views clearly, preferring instead the comfort of ambiguity or
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambition had fueled a desire to please, and had choked my
leadership impulses,'' he goes on. ``For much of my career I had no
authentic political voice. I had been campaigning all over the
country not to change the world or shake up my audiences but to
please the roomful of people to whom I was speaking.'' Not until
1991 did he begin ``to speak from my gut as well as my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore writes of undergoing a midlife crisis around the same time.
He says that in 1989, having just turned 40, lost a presidential
campaign and seen his son, Albert, nearly die in an automobile
accident, he became ``impatient with my own tendency to put a
finger to the political winds and proceed cautiously.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he explains, he ``learned many political skills simply
by observing my parents'' _ his father, Albert Gore Sr., was a
congressman and senator from Tennessee for 32 years; his mother, a
devoted campaign veteran. Later, he found himself ``unconsciously
practicing a new set of `personality skills,''' based on the visual
rhetoric of television. Although Gore writes that he became
increasingly aware of how ``easy it is for every politician _
myself included _ to get lost in the forms of personality traits
designed to please and rhetoric designed to convey a tactical
impression,'' this awareness does not seem to have dampened his
enthusiasm for the sort of image-spinning represented by his recent
efforts to act more relaxed and wear more casual, earth-toned
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who have covered Gore have written that his genteel
upbringing lacked only unconditional love: his father was
frequently away from home, and was, by his own admission ``an
insistent taskmaster.'' And while Gore, who became involved in
family therapy after his son's car accident, does not write
directly about his parents in this book, he does talk in impersonal
terms about dysfunctional families and psychological wounds,
authentic and inauthentic selves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A developing child in a dysfunctional family searches his
parent's face for signals that he is whole and all is right with
the world,'' Gore writes. ``When he finds no such approval, he
begins to feel that something is wrong inside. And because he
doubts his worth and authenticity, he begins controlling his inner
experience _ smothering spontaneity, masking emotion, diverting
creativity into robotic routine, and distracting an awareness of
all he is missing with an unconvincing replica of what he might
have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has a penchant for extrapolating from the specific to
the general, from the personal to the abstract, believes that such
dysfunctional behavior is now being perpetuated on a global scale
by cultures out of touch with the world of nature.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Relationships with their fathers _ in most cases, powerful,
high-profile fathers _ figure so prominently in these candidates'
careers that their biographies might well be taken as illustrations
of the writer Susan Faludi's thesis about the primacy of the
father-son bond. Gore's quest for the White House echoes his
father's own unrealized dream of winning that prize, just as
becoming president would represent his final emergence from the
shadow of the two alpha males in his life, his father and Bill
Clinton. Forbes' pursuit of the White House similarly mirrors the
aspirations of his father _ the flamboyant publisher Malcolm Forbes
_ who wanted to be president and twice ran unsuccessfully for
governor of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decisions to join the military and go to Vietnam were
part of a continuing effort to earn the respect of his father and
grandfather _ both, four-star admirals in the Navy _ and to live
his life, as he writes in his book, ``according to the terms of
their approval.'' And Bradley's ``obsession with rectitude,'' often
assailed as sanctimony by his critics, stems in large measure from
being programmed to become a gentleman by a father who believed
that virtue could be measured by ``a good credit rating, keeping
your word, saving your money, and never, ever getting close to the
`unethical.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, has spent much of his life following in his
famous father's footsteps: Andover, Yale, the Texas oil business.
Though friends have talked about the hardships Bush suffered over
the years in the constant comparisons with his father, the success
he has recently enjoyed as governor of Texas seems to have erased
such doubts. In ``A Charge to Keep,'' he cheerfully points out that
he is sometimes ``too blunt for my own good,'' and that his father
is ``milder-mannered, more thoughtful'' than he is. He also alludes
to his concern that a run for the White House might put his father
in a poor light. He quotes a letter from George the Elder telling
him not to worry about stories that ``contrast you favorably to a
father who had no vision and who was but a place holder in the
broader scheme of things'' _ a worry, in light of the recent
contretemps over George the Younger's lack of foreign policy
expertise, that somehow seems beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   So what else do these books tell us about the candidates? That
McCain once contemplated joining the French Foreign Legion. That
Bush, like a famous Seinfeld character, tends to violate other
people's personal space, ``leaning into them, touching, hugging,
getting close.'' That Bradley used to listen to the Rolling Stones'
``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' and ``Honky Tonk Woman'' to
psyche himself up for Knicks games (before college games, the
writer John McPhee has reported, the young Bradley would listen to
``Climb Every Mountain'' from ``The Sound of Music''). That Gore,
sounding a lot like Naomi Wolf (who once tried to draw parallels
between the Holocaust and anorexia), likes to compare the world's
worsening environmental problems to Hitler's rise in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   As for books the candidates mention themselves: Bradley uses
epigraphs from Fitzgerald, Eliot and Conrad, and refers to writers
like Tolstoy, Brecht, John Updike, Richard Wright and Louise
Erdrich along the way. McCain says he entertained his fellow POW's
in Vietnam with memorized renditions of stories by Kipling,
Hemingway and Maugham. Gore seasons the text of ``Earth in the
Balance'' with allusions to writers as disparate as Descartes and
John Bradshaw, Sir Francis Bacon and Buckminster Fuller. Bush, who
repeatedly says he loves books, discusses only one title in his
memoir _ the Bible, which he says he reads through every other
year. And Forbes refers, in passing, to ``The Federalist Papers,''
Paine's ``Common Sense'' and the best-seller, ``The Seven Habits of
Highly Effective People.''

   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ Five months after NATO forces moved in to
take absolute control of Kosovo, there is little electricity and an
inconstant water supply, the streets are full of garbage, traffic
is in chaos without working stop lights or police direction, few
cars have license plates, and no one has new identity papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Albanians driven out by the Serbs have
returned from refugee camps, and the Serbian and Gypsy minorities
continue to be harassed and attacked. The U.N. government here,
starved of funds by the countries that fought and won the war, is
unable to pay salaries even to the public employees it is supposed
to control.
</P>
<P>
   Justice is rare and court trials nearly nonexistent, so few are
punished; robberies, apartment thefts, extortion and even murders
take place with near impunity, some of it a function of organized
crime. There are only 1,700 international police officers to
provide security, and the patrols of the NATO-led peacekeeping
force are generally static and unaggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The burning of Serbs' homes takes place almost daily in an
organized fashion, increasing the pressure on the Serbian minority
to flee the province or ghettoize itself in enclaves, surrounded by
hostile Albanians who remember their own years of repression.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who will visit Kosovo for a few hours on
Tuesday to thank U.S. troops and wish them a happy Thanksgiving at
their huge and heavily secured base, Camp Bondsteel, will see
little of today's Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of revenge and intolerance is eroding the U.N. goal
of multiethnicity, and the only multiethnic organization actually
functioning is the nascent police force, where a few of the 170 or
so cadets graduated thus far are Serbs or members of other
minorities. It would be wonderful enough, officials say, if the
people here would simply stop killing one another or turning away
as others kill and manage at least to live side by side. But no one
expects that happy prospect any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. special representative on human rights in the former
Yugoslavia, Jiri Dienstbier, a former Czech dissident and foreign
minister, reported this month that ``the spring ethnic cleansing of
ethnic Albanians accompanied by murders, torture, looting and
burning of houses has been replaced by the fall ethnic cleansing of
Serbs, Romas, Bosniaks and other non-Albanians accompanied by the
same atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem,'' he continued, ``is that now this is happening
in the presence of Unmik, KFOR and the OSCE.'' The organizations
behind those missions here _ the United Nations, NATO and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe _ represent
nations that for years criticized President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia for his harsh repression of Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   There are vivid signs of rebuilding, of the reconstruction of
houses and the rapid development of small businesses, especially in
the major towns, where foreign workers now based in Kosovo are
flush with cash. Those foreign aid workers are giving vital food
and help in countless ways _ providing emergency shelter and
900,000 meals a day, for instance, in a province believed to
contain about 1.4 million people now. But despite the presence of
as many as 55,000 foreigners _ 42,000 of them peacekeeping troops _
the energy one sees comes from the Albanians themselves, with
access to money of their own or of relatives abroad, and not from
international efforts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the situation here comes from Albanians, Serbs and
many international agencies, and the mood among the staff of the
U.N. mission in Kosovo, the transitional government run by Bernard
Kouchner, is beleaguered and somber.
</P>
<P>
   Baton Haxhiu, the editor in chief of the Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, said bluntly: ``I'm depressed that after 10 years of
sanctions, Serbia is building bridges, and apartments have
electricity and water, and we have 42,000 Western soldiers and
police and 335 aid agencies, and we don't have the basics of a
state _ no justice, no security, no electricity, no water and no
identity documents. It's alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Linda Gusia, a young Albanian who works as a translator, said:
``You sit in your apartment with little electricity or water and
look out the window at the traffic, and it's a chaos. The United
Nations has not spent all the glory of NATO's victory yet _ people
still view them as saviors. But if they don't produce soon, they
will spend all the glory. People want civic structures here and a
normal life. People don't understand simple things, like why the
police don't get out and direct traffic when there's no
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner and his aides say that work is going ahead to fix the
dilapidated and badly maintained generators in Kosovo, which they
took over from the peacekeeping force a month ago, and to secure
more power from abroad. They promise that power and water supplies
will be close to regular by mid-December, if not before. A second
mobile telephone system will be set up.
</P>
<P>
   They are waiting for governments to provide more police
officers, as promised; Kouchner wants 6,000. The registration of
citizens, which must happen before Kouchner can even contemplate
any kind of elections, is planned but not yet financed. The
registration of cars will start soon. They are trying to get more
Albanian and Serbian judges to work, and will bring in some
international jurists to help.
</P>
<P>
   Their main problem, they say, is less their own inefficiency _
which they admit is real but insist is diminishing _ than the
simple lack of financial support from the same Western alliance
that won the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments are always tired of giving money,'' Kouchner said,
especially for unglamorous needs like paying salaries. ``But this
is the first time that we are in charge of a country, and we have
to rebuild the whole administration from nothing, and we need a
minimum budget to pay for public services and salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ridiculous, Kouchner says, that he is able to pay doctors,
lawyers and teachers a stipend in lieu of salary of only about
$170, and that not even every month as promised, but every other
month _ far from enough to feed a family.
</P>
<P>
   There have been long and bitter discussions between Pristina and
European and U.S. officials about how to get the $25 million needed
to cover this year's shortfall, and the estimated $150 million gap
in next year's budget for the U.N. mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the price of half a day's bombing,'' a senior U.N.
official said with real rancor in his voice. ``The West has got to
invest in the peace or this place will fail. And no one wants it to
fail more than Slobodan Milosevic.''

<P>
   A donor's conference of Western governments on Kosovo on
Wednesday produced a pledge of $1 billion in aid for reconstruction
for next year _ but only $88 million to cover the budget for the
U.N. mission, just about half of what is needed. And officials said
any funds would arrive too late to make a real impact this year,
when moods, and public services, are at a nadir.
</P>
<P>
   Besides money, Kouchner said, his biggest concern is security
for the minority population, especially the Serbs, who are believed
now to number 60,000 to 70,000 in Kosovo, senior officials say,
down from perhaps 200,000 to 250,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since not every Serb can be protected, Albanian efforts to drive
them out of cities like Pristina, Pec and Prizren have largely
succeeded, with perhaps 600 Serbs left in Pristina and fewer in the
other two towns. In Podujevo, officials say, two or three elderly
Serbs remain, their apartments guarded around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officers with the NATO force acknowledge problems, but
one said bluntly, ``Our major problem is to wait for the civilian
side to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said the force, known as KFOR, ``can't build a
judicial system, and it can't issue identity documents,'' adding:
``We can detain people and bring them to a local magistrate and get
them held for six months, but they have to have a trial, and they
don't exist. There has to be a process through a system.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer decried apparent Western governmental delay and
fatigue, saying, ``Kosovo has not become the quiet and happy place
the world community expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of feuds between foreign military and civilian
officials overseeing Bosnia, senior KFOR officers blame the United
Nations for being slow to punish crimes, while U.N. officials here
say that the NATO force could also patrol more aggressively,
especially in the Italian and German sectors in western Kosovo.
``KFOR, with all its intelligence resources, must have better
information on those responsible for ethnic violence,'' an official
said, but the force will not share it with civilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and moderate Albanians note that the Serbian
atrocities of the last decade in Kosovo were a function of a modern
state and represented a form of state terrorism. The Albanian
atrocities, they say, show signs of at least local organization
from those who want all minorities out of Kosovo. But there is
little evidence of any order to that effect from former Kosovo
Liberation Army leaders like Hashim Thaci or Gen. Agim Ceku, who
have both spoken publicly, when asked to, in favor of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also little resistance to abuses against Serbs, a
senior U.N. official said. Among the Albanians, he said, ``the
voices of moderation and tolerance are few and not representative,
and they themselves are under threat.'' He added, ``Just watch the
kids spitting on Serbs or stoning them, and no one says a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanian newspapers, especially Bota Sot, are full of hate
speech directed at Serbs, Gypsies and even moderate Albanians, with
even some incitement to violence.
</P>
<P>
   This month, in the U.S. zone near Gnjilane, workers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe discovered a
leaflet issued by the Kosovo Protection Corps, the new organization
formed from the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army and
intended to be purely civilian, calling on all Albanians not to buy
any Serbian property. Concerned U.N.officials provided a
translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With criminals,'' the appeal says, ``we must exchange other
things, not buy our properties from them.'' Those who do buy Serb
property, the leaflet says, are ``completely irresponsible and
anti-nation Albanian speakers who are not freedom-loving people.''
</P>
<P>
   It warns: ``Whoever does not respect our request will be put
before responsible authorities,'' adding that ``it is known which
are the responsible authorities'' _ clearly not KFOR or the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.N. and military officials also say that two detention
camps were discovered on grounds belonging to the Kosovo Protection
Corps, which is supposed to have no police functions, and that the
camps contained both Albanians and Serbs suspected of war crimes,
some of whom bore evidence of beatings.
</P>
<P>
   And they note the killings of at least two local leaders of the
party of Ibrahim Rugova, a political rival of Thaci _ as a sign of
increased political intimidation among Albanians, about which
foreigners here know very little.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining Serbs, caught between Milosevic and angry
Albanians, feel especially threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Father Sava, an aide to Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox
Church, has had to move from the Decani monastery near Pec, in
western Kosovo, to Gracanica, near Pristina, where there are more
Serbs and better NATO protection.
</P>
<P>
   He says individual KFOR companies and soldiers have been
excellent on a local level, but failed to prevent retaliation
against the Serbs, Gypsies and other minorities. ``They simply want
to avoid military confrontation with the Kosovo Liberation Army,
and don't want them becoming a terrorist organization that shoots
them as they did Milosevic's soldiers and police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 Serbian Orthodox churches, monasteries and holy
places have been damaged or destroyed since NATO forces arrived in
June, he said, including a dozen from the 14th and 15th centuries.
The church of the Virgin Mary near Suva Reka, dating from 1315, has
been leveled.
</P>
<P>
   Father Sava acknowledges that the Serbs damaged or destroyed
many mosques during the war, and has forcefully repeated his and
the church's regrets for Serbian crimes against Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 8, he told the U.N. radio station here that he again
wished ``to express my greatest regret for everything that was done
by the members of the Serbian people and special forces against
Albanian civilians, which is a very serious crime, but I also
sincerely expect that reasonable and honest Albanians would also
raise their voice against the violence we now witness in many
cities of Kosovo, which are almost cleansed of their non-Albanian
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Sava also noted: ``Now we can see that many Albanians
would like to stop the violence against Serbs, but they cannot,
they are intimidated, they are scared, as many Serbs felt before.''
</P>
<P>
   He, like Haxhiu and most Albanians, says the main problem of
Kosovo is criminal impunity. ``If you behave like a criminal you
should be brought to court,'' Father Sava said. ``But courts are
not working, there's no legal system, and this is a paradise for
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kouchner, an emotional man, spoke sadly about
the intolerance of a society traumatized by war and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had Secretary-General Kofi Annan's approval to try to
share government duties with local leaders, with himself retaining
ultimate power. But even local elections seem far off _ maybe fall
or winter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to get either the leaders or the people in both
the Albanian and Serbian populations to cooperate, Kouchner
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from both communities are mostly unable to think about
the suffering of others, only about their own suffering.'' It is
more understandable from the Albanians, he said, who do not always
refuse cooperation, but are suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to come to help and find that you are perceived
sometimes as an enemy, and not just by the Serbs but also by the
Albanians who we came to defend,'' he said. ``Every failure, every
assassination, every murder here is a victory for Milosevic.''

<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ When a group of newly freed slaves here
wanted to form a community of their own just after the Civil War,
they had to take whatever land they could get. In 1865, that was a
snake-infested, mosquito-ridden swamp in a flood plain along the
southern side of the Tar River in eastern North Carolina. It was
land that the white people in Tarboro, on the northern side
of the river, did not want.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, those former slaves had built a town so
viable that they petitioned the state to recognize it as a legal
entity. In 1865, Princeville became the first town in the United
States to be chartered and governed solely by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now the more than 2,000 residents of Princeville, many of whom
are direct descendants of its founders, are struggling with a
dilemma more extreme than any other this town has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   Their storied community was washed away in September by the
worst flooding in North Carolina's history. Now they must choose
whether to return to the now uninhabited land and rebuild, or
abandon forever the place where their ancestors first experienced
full U.S. citizenship. The impending decision has those who would
accept a federal buyout of the town at odds with the many who
believe that doing so would betray the cherished legacy of their
forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge we are facing in Princeville,'' said Rep. Eva
Clayton, the Democrat whose district includes the town, ``is how to
keep its legacy and make it viable in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of places similarly devastated by floods in recent
years have accepted government buyouts of all or part of their
towns. Grand Forks, N.D., was one, along with Valmeyer, Ill., and
Kinston, N.C. Federal Emergency Management Agency officials have
already received word from at least 45 city or county governments
affected by the floods in eastern North Carolina that they intend
to apply for federal buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   In all, officials estimate, the flooding caused $1.2 billion
worth of structural damage across the state. Of the 6,000 buildings
that the federal agency estimates were damaged beyond repair
statewide, about 600 are in Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Princeville officials reported that only 75
people had signed up so far. The town has given its residents,
about 40 of whom are white, a Dec. 16 deadline to submit
applications. After that, city leaders will decide whether there is
enough interest to apply for the buyout. The town government must
make a formal application before any individual applications are
considered. If the town decides against a buyout, no residents will
be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   For Glennie Matthewson 2nd, 55, a lawyer and former Princeville
mayor, leaving is not an option. His great-grandmother was a slave
and one of the first residents of Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our ancestors built this town they were seen as uppity
blacks, with the audacity to talk about incorporating their own
town,'' Matthewson said. ``That is a hell of a legacy. The deeper
the roots the harder the fight, and the more resistance you're
going to get to taking the town from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Princeville, Delia Perkins, 57, lost her home in
the flood, but she too remains firm about returning. She works full
time as a teacher's assistant in the Edgecombe County School system
and receives $250 a month to serve as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers,'' she said, ``I would have said from Day
1 that we will rebuild, no doubt about it.'' But she added that she
believes the town government must consider all its options.
</P>
<P>
   Some question the wisdom of rebuilding. Marcia Wheeler, 43, a
mother of two, says she has no plans to return _ ever. ``I wouldn't
want to go through this again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the buyout, the Federal Emergency Management Agency would
purchase property for what appraisers estimate was the market value
the day before the flood. The buildings would be removed and the
open space deeded back to the town, but it could never be built on
again.
</P>
<P>
   If the town decides to rebuild, money from a federal buyout will
not be available and the town will seek money from other government
agencies and private sources. The mayor estimates the cost of
rebuilding to be at least $80 million. Central to the effort would
be reconstruction of a dike that controls the Tar River. That cost
is estimated at $300,000 and would be paid for by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The levee was built in 1965, a century after the settlement of
the area. It was designed to protect the town against the kind of
flood estimated to happen only every 300 years. That levy afforded
enough protection to negate the flood-plain status of the town in
official terms. And it is what allows the town to even consider the
option of returning to the same site.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Davison, mitigation director of the emergency management
agency, said the U.S. Geological Survey issued a report this month
saying the recent flood was well in excess of a 500-year event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a biblical kind of flood,'' Davison said. ``The risk
is so remote that we don't regulate against it, just as we don't
protect against meteors.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Tar River began its rampage on Sept. 16, as the result of
the 20 inches of rain dumped on the state by Hurricane Floyd. On
the day it spilled over the dike, it had reached 48.5 feet above
sea level. Early the next morning the town was evacuated. The river
crested at 53 feet above sea level, and the town remained under
about 14 feet of water for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When residents were allowed to return, they were shocked to see
houses that had floated off their foundations and landed on top of
cars. Precious family photographs, keepsakes and heirlooms were
lost. Many houses had been condemned. More than 200 coffins
dislodged from the town cemetery were found floating around the
town. None of the original slaves' graves were disturbed _ perhaps
because they had been dug deeper than more recent graves.
</P>
<P>
   And even today, two months after the deluge, the damage is
strikingly evident in the deserted town. Mud-caked clothes hang
from trees. The water has gone and most of the facades of houses
are still intact, but their insides have been stripped bare to
remove destroyed furniture and rotted drywall.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case at Linda Whitest's home on Walston Street in
the heart of Princeville. Her one-year-old house was destroyed by
flood waters. Across the street, her grandmother's house, where Ms.
Whitest, 49, grew up, was destroyed. Next door to her grandmother's
house, her mother's house was also ruined. The homes are all
situated on land handed down from Ms. Whitest's great-grandfather,
Frank Walston, a son of slaves and the man for whom the street was
named.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago I said there is no way I'm going back, I was so
devastated,'' Ms. Whitest said. ``But then I thought about it, and
I said, why should I give up what my ancestors had worked so hard
to leave us? It would be like Princeville never existed, like it
had just been erased away.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthewson said moving the town even a few blocks away is
unacceptable to most residents. ``My ancestors' energies and
efforts and resources went into that specific property in
Princeville,'' he said. ``Those are the streets I played in, the
trees I climbed. You take the town and move it anywhere else, then
you've severed me from my actual roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the flooding, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al
Sharpton both visited the town, as did President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was Valley Forge,'' Sharpton said, ``imagine what
America would be doing. We preach black pride. Here's an example of
a city that has faced a major disaster. I think it's incumbent upon
black America to use its economic and political resources to try to
restore that city.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with other flood victims, the displaced residents of
Princeville are living either with friends or family or in the
temporary trailer park set up by the emergency management agency in
nearby Rocky Mount. The trailer park, just around the corner from a
women's prison, is officially named New Life Fountain Park.
Residents call it FEMA City.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Black, 35, a construction worker, has been living at the
temporary site since it was opened about seven weeks ago. He said
he plans to return to the Princeville property passed down to him
by his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people took that swampland and made a town out of it,''
Black said. ``It would make us look real bad to let it go now.''

CHINA TAKES A GIANT LEAP CLOSER TO MANNED SPACEFLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China announced Sunday its first successful launching
and recovery of an unmanned spacecraft, an important step toward
its goal of putting humans in space.
</P>
<P>
   The launching was not a surprise to Western diplomats and space
experts, some of whom think that China may be able to put humans in
space as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the most significant breakthrough yet in President
Jiang Zemin's drive for China to join the small club of nations
that have succeeded in putting people in space, which press reports
said he spurred in 1992. It may also enhance his efforts to make
his country a respected global power.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it kept secret critical details of the event, the
Chinese government immediately began working to harvest publicity
gains. Accounts of the flight, and the reported excitement and
pride it inspired among the Chinese people, practically took over
Sunday evening's television news.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule, which was hoisted atop a Long March rocket with
four external engines at the base, was fired into orbit at 6:30
a.m. on Saturday from a pad in the northwestern province of Gansu,
according to the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   After completing 14 orbits at an altitude of about 186 miles,
the craft received a signal from a ship to slow down, arced toward
earth and parachuted to a landing zone in inner Mongolia at 3:41
a.m. Sunday, according to the official news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The spaceflight was kept secret until its successful conclusion,
after which television pictures of the launching and official
journalists' articles were released.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent success ``once again demonstrates that China is
fully capable of independently mastering the most advanced
technology,'' said a ``leading expert'' who heads the country's
manned space flight program, in an interview issued by the New
China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The program chief's name was concealed, apparently because it is
considered classified.
</P>
<P>
   David Shambaugh, an expert on the Chinese military at George
Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington,
said, ``The research and development, production and launching
activities of the Chinese space program are all under military
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Long March rockets, used to put satellites as well as the
spacecraft into orbit on Saturday, are nearly identical to the Dong
Feng intercontinental ballistic missiles in China's nuclear forces,
Shambaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   China has been stung in recent years by accusations that it
stole U.S. rocket and nuclear-bomb secrets, and this weekend's
21-hour flight is being trumpeted as a validation of indigenous
science.
</P>
<P>
   Development of a manned space program will boost ``the country's
comprehensive national strength, promote the development of science
and technology, enhance national prestige, and boost the nation's
sense of pride and cohesiveness,'' the unnamed program chief was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The official added that more unmanned test flights would be
conducted before astronauts were sent into space. Though much of
the program has been kept secret, photographs purporting to show
the rocket and orbiter at the Jiuquan launching site in Gansu, the
one used on Saturday, mysteriously appeared on the Internet last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, which Western experts said is similar to the
capsules used by the Soviet Union and the United States in the
heyday of manned earth orbiting in the 1960s, was named Shenzhou,
which means magic vessel but is also a pun on a word for China.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang supposedly chose the name, and Sunday morning's issue of
the People's Daily carried that name written in his calligraphy,
along with a brief report of the successful flight, which ended
just before a delayed press time.
</P>
<P>
   For Jiang, the manned space proja matter of both personal
and national prestige. Only the United States and Russia, and the
Soviet Union before it, have marshaled the technology and money to
send people into space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, China launched its first satellite, named The East is
Red.
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing its own space program, China has maintained a
profitable business using its rockets to launch commercial
satellites from other countries, including the United States.
Official reports here Sunday noted that this was the 59th launching
of the Long March series of rockets, and that the previous 17, over
the last three years, had been successful. Some well-known
explosions of satellite-carrying rockets in 1995 and 1996 were not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, China made a deal with Russia to acquire certain space
technologies, including information on life-support systems,
spacecraft docking mechanisms and space suits. Then in 1996, two
Chinese astronauts along with more than a dozen trainers and
support workers began a year of training at a Russian cosmonaut
center outside Moscow, according to Western experts.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials at that time suggested that a manned flight
would occur by the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic, on
Oct. 1 of this year, but that target proved too ambitious.

REPUBLICANS ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON IN TV AD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of Jewish Republicans has produced a
television commercial attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton for
remaining silent at an event two weeks ago where the Palestinian
first lady accused Israel of poisoning Palestinian women and
children with toxic gases.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Jewish Republican Coalition, which is based in
Washington, said it will spend about $50,000 to broadcast the
commercial for one week, starting Tuesday, in Washington and in New
York, mostly on cable television. The commercial offers an example
of how Mrs. Clinton's political opponents will try to appeal to
Jewish voters by painting her as inconsistent on Middle East
issues.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory campaign for the U.S.
Senate in New York sought to link the commercial to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican opponent in next year's
Senate race, but an adviser to the mayor denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting Israel earlier this month, Mrs. Clinton attended
an event in Ramallah on the West Bank for the announcement of a
U.S.-sponsored maternal health care program. It was at that event
that Suha Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian Authority president,
Yasser Arafat, said that the Israeli military had used carcinogenic
crowd-control gases in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton listened with obvious discomfort but left politely,
giving Mrs. Arafat a kiss. Mrs. Arafat's remarks were later
denounced angrily by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, and in
New York, Mrs. Clinton was criticized by several newspapers and
groups for not speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   The new television ad was screened Sunday on ABC's ``This
Week,'' while Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's
exploratory Senate campaign committee, was appearing on the show as
a guest.
</P>
<P>
   With ominous music playing in the background, the commercial
shows Mrs. Clinton with Mrs. Arafat while a narrator says: ``With
Hillary Clinton at her side, Suha Arafat made the false and
disgraceful claim that Israel was poisoning Palestinian women and
children with toxic gases. Instead of reacting with outrage,
Hillary Clinton sat by silently. When Arafat was finished, Hillary
gave her a hug and a kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator adds, ``It's sad. While Israel sacrifices for
peace, Arafat spreads hatred and lies. And Hillary embraces her.
Tell Hillary Clinton. Stand up for Israel. Stand up for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   On the news program, Wolfson denounced the ad and sought to link
it to Giuliani. ``This ad is an outrage,'' he said. ``New Yorkers
are accustomed to the negative campaigning of Rudy Giuliani and his
team, but this is really a very low blow. There are clear
connections between the mayor and this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of Giuliani's Senate exploratory
committee, said the mayor had ``no connection whatsoever to the
ad,'' but, referring to the Jewish Republican Coalition, he said,
``it is certainly appropriate, and it's their right to run any ad
they see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Brooks, the executive director of the Jewish Republican
Coalition, said the group had produced the ad on its own, using
money from its operating budget, as a response to Mrs. Clinton's
Middle East trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly that while she was representing us
internationally as first lady, she did not conduct herself in a
manner that was appropriate,'' Brooks said. ``Her actions and her
silence in the face of these outrageous comments by Mrs. Arafat did
not only send the wrong message here at home but also have
significant repercussions internationally.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ By passing the hat among its neighbors, who happen to
be America's most densely packed bunch of rich people, Central Park
has harvested the largest haul of private dollars ever raised for a
public park.
</P>
<P>
   As is obvious to the 20 million people who enter the park every
year, this bumper crop of philanthropy, $233 million so far, has
done a world of good. The graffiti-smeared ruin that was an
international embarrassment two decades ago has been reborn as a
meticulously restored greensward where bronze-preservation
specialists each year polish and wax all 50 of the park's statues.
</P>
<P>
   What is far less obvious is how this happened.
</P>
<P>
   To exploit the giving habits of New York's elite, the park
reinvented itself as an elite cultural charity. It has become a
player in the most exclusive social ritual in town, shrewdly
capitalizing on unwritten rules about how the rich must give to one
another's pet causes or face social ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious still is the profound effect that Central Park has
had on other urban parks not encircled by multimillionaires. Park
advocates across New York admit they resent Central Park's
phenomenal success, but nevertheless copy its management and
fund-raising methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something healthy even in envy,'' said Elizabeth
Barlow Rogers, who created the Central Park Conservancy 20 years
ago and ran it for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has become the dominant model, in New York and
across the country, for groups trying to revive crumbling urban
parks, said Chris Walker, director of community and economic
development for the Urban Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost impossible to discuss park restoration in the
United States without discussing Central Park,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People who live near some of New York City's most troubled parks
are imitating the conservancy. Around Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem,
neighbors are raising money from local businesses, hospitals and
developers. They have recruited volunteers to clean up the park and
plant flowers. A gardener trained in Central Park will soon begin
working in their park, his salary paid by a private grant.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live near Marcus Garvey say they are painfully aware
of the demographic chasm that separates them from Central Park.
Their October fund-raising dinner raised $7,000. The Central Park
Conservancy's Halloween Ball raised $805,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have much money, but we are getting organized as a
pressure group,'' said Helen Murray, a retired nurse who lives in a
brownstone next to the park. ``Central Park is a model that gives
us a very high standard to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither imitation nor envy, though, can conjure up the fuel that
powers Central Park: private money, donated in huge chunks. The
rebirth of the park, as much as anything, is a story about why the
wealthy give in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As major park donors themselves explain, the rich tend to give
to what they know and to what gives them personal satisfaction. It
is no accident that many of the park's largest benefactors can
monitor their giving from their apartment windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is visible, you can touch it, you can partake of it,
you can brag about it, you can see the difference your money
makes,'' said Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Financial
Markets. He is a member of the conservancy's board and a major
donor, and lives half a block from the park.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gilder, a stockbroker who grew up playing in Central
Park and now lives beside it on Fifth Avenue, has given the park
$17 million, which is believed to be the largest gift from any
individual to any municipal park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a natural for people who live near the park,'' Gilder
said. Social considerations also figure strongly for donors.
Although the conservancy is a relative arriviste among the city's
charities, it has staked out a status niche that puts it roughly on
a par with the Museum of Modern Art or Carnegie Hall, which is to
say only slightly less chic than the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
several philanthropists said.
</P>
<P>
   Things were different in the late 1970s, when Central Park was
``a disaster zone,'' in the words of Gordon Davis, then the
commissioner of parks. The city's fiscal crisis had cut spending on
parks by nearly two-thirds, and Central Park had lost about half
its work force. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., called Davis,
told him that the park was a ``national disgrace'' and threatened a
federal takeover.
</P>
<P>
   CastiNg about for a way to rescue the park, Davis concluded that
the only w!y torevive it was to find one person to run it. He
settled on Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, who had written a book on
Frederick Law Olmsted, the principal designer of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rogers had a simple and, as it turned out, profoundly
powerful idea. She decided that the park should be a cultural
institution, rather like the Metropolitan Museum. ``The trees and
the monuments and the gardens are our collection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an easy sell. The park was bordered by many thousands of
the country's richest people, many of whom had strong emotional and
financial reasons for resuscitating it.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cook, the executive director of the Park Council, a
90-year-old nonprofit that is critical of the city's reliance on
private money in the parks, said she was impressed that the
conservancy had raised so much money but was concerned that all of
it went to just one park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that the wealthy who give so generously to Central Park
would give equally to the rest of the park system,'' said Ms. Cook
``We are concerned that this is creating a two-tiered park system
in New York City, one rich, one not.''
</P>
<P>
   A few restive members on the board of the Central Park
Conservancy believe that since the park is almost completely
refurbished, the conservancy should take its act on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have a loftier goal for ourselves,'' said Gilder,
who has been lobbying the conservancy board to shift some of its
expertise and fund-raising ability to Morningside Park in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of spreading the wealth, however, is not yet popular
among most conservancy donors, who as a rule do not give to
charities that support other city parks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, with Central Park having been elevated to such a
rarefied standard, donors are worried about the soaring cost of
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to meet our ongoing costs?'' asked Karen
Putnam, the conservancy's president. ``We are not to the point
where we can put our feet on the desk and take on another park. We
have our hands full.''

D.C. UNITED ARE CHAMPIONS AGAIN, BEATING L.A. 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Two defensive blunders by the Los Angeles
Galaxy was all D.C. United needed Sunday to capture its third title
in the four years of Major League Soccer with a 2-0 victory before
44,910 at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was an afternoon full of misfortune for the Galaxy, who also
lost the championship game to United in the league's first season.
But United was the superior team for the most part, playing with
abundant confidence, and the team was rarely threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes into the game, the Galaxy lost Robin Fraser, the
league's defender of the year, who broke his collar bone in a
footrace with Roy Lassiter near the sideline, forcing Coach Sigi
Schmid of the Galaxy to make drastic adjustments in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a couple of mistakes that led to goals,'' Schmid said,
``but take nothing away from D.C. United. They're an outstanding
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's defensive play was nowhere near the quality it
displayed during the regular season, when it allowed 29 goals in 32
games, becoming the first team in the history of the league to
allow less than a goal a game. The defense was disorganized Sunday,
and Kevin Hartman, the league's goalkeeper of the year, was even
worse than his defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Galigiuri, who scored the goal 10 years ago that sent the
United States to the 1990 World Cup in Italy, its first Cup
appearance in 40 years, failed to clear the ball after a save by
Hartman in the 19th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Moreno, the deadly United striker, leaped on the ball and
beat Hartman from close range for his fifth goal in the playoffs
this season and 10th in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have still won even if Fraser was there,'' Moreno
said after the game. ``We came here determined to win. We were the
better team and we felt the Galaxy had to play a very good game to
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy committed several mistakes on defense, but none was
bigger than Hartman's during injury time before intermission.
Hartman had two chances to clear after a back-pass by Steve Jolley,
who took Fraser's place. Hartman scuffed the ground on his second
attempt, allowing Ben Olsen of United to collect the ball and
deposit it into the empty net from 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen did plenty of constructive work on the right side of
United's midfield and was voted the game's most valuable player,
although Richie Williams, the indefatigable defensive midfielder of
United, also had an excellent game.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Williams shadowed Mauricio Cienfuegos, the
Galaxy's playmaker, so effectively that the Galaxy never found a
rhythm offensively. Tom Presthus, United's goalkeeper, was forced
to make just one save.
</P>
<P>
   United came into the game as the league's most productive team
and played with the composure and confidence of a champion. With
Marco Etcheverry conducting from the center of the midfield, all
United's components worked effectively on offense, while the
defense was anchored by Eddie Pope and Calos Liamosa.
</P>
<P>
   United continues to set the standard in the four-year-old
league. This was its fourth trip to the championship game and the
only time it lost was last year, to Chicago in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific to have a dominant team,'' said
Commissioner Don Garber. ``There will be teams shooting after them
all year.''
</P>
<P>
   CORNER KICKS
</P>
<P>
   The league decided earlier in the day to put into effect in this
game one of the rule changes it will enforce next season. The clock
runs from zero to 90 minutes and the official time was kept by the
referee, Tim Weyland, while a fourth official determined the amount
of injury time added at the end of each half. ... With his goal,
Jaime Moreno became the league's leading scorer in the playoffs
with 28 points from 10 goals and eight assists.

JAPANESE LEGISLATORS TRY TO PEP UP DEBATE BY EMULATING BRITAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The prime minister is at the podium, struggling to field
a series of increasingly challenging questions from the leader of
the opposition. Jeers are rising in crescendo from the Parliament
floor, and the few spectators allowed in are on the edge of their
seats, fairly straining for a view.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, known as question time, has been adopted straight
from British politics. On the surface, just two weeks into its
existence, it still may seem like a jolting innovation to some in
the often soporific world of the Japanese Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Of course that was the idea _ arrived at jointly by the
government and the opposition _ from the start: that the Parliament
of the nation where consensus is so highly valued that trenchant
comment had become an endangered species needed some serious
reinvigoration. And what better way, it was thought, than a dose of
old-fashioned, British style confrontational debate?
</P>
<P>
   From technology to popular culture, Japan is well known for its
facility for borrowing from other countries. Its Parliament was
modeled on those of Europe, and foreign models inspired most of
this country's modern institutions.
</P>
<P>
   What is less widely known abroad is how assiduously Japan
reshapes whatever it borrows, molding everything from Chinese food
to American words to fit within the nation's rather narrow comfort
zones. And as it is already turning out, question time is no
different.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Yukio Hatoyama, the leader of the opposition
Democratic Party, standing tall and tugging at his shirt cuffs for
dramatic effect demanding an explanation from Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi about why policemen have not been arrested in a provincial
corruption case.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the most compelling question to begin the second
edition of the new, weekly 40-minute debate? Perhaps not, but it
was an improvement over Hatoyama's first try, a week earlier, when
the nation's eyes were bracketed on him as he began the new
spectacle by asking Obuchi what he had eaten for breakfast that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt confrontation, it seems, does not come any more easily to
Japanese politicians than it does to ordinary Japanese, whose
national language is a maze of well-practiced protocols and polite
indirection. But to be fair, Hatoyama eventually warmed to his
subject in the 26 minutes accorded him.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Obuchi temporarily suspend unpopular tax payments for a
national nursing care system just as elections are nearing,
Hatoyama asked. And how was it that the conservative governing
party, the Liberal Democrats, had gone into coalition recently with
a party widely seen as the creature of the country's largest
Buddhist organization?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening because you share a desire to be ruling
parties, not because you have agreed on any policies beforehand,''
Hatoyama said. ``And you should be ashamed of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat further, the opposition leader handed Obuchi
a three-year-old pamphlet from the prime minister's own party that
denounced the Buddhist-affiliated party as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning heavily on his podium, Obuchi replied weakly: ``Around
that time that was the mainstream view of the party. But after that
we have had some twists and turns.''
</P>
<P>
   If that exchange furnished a touch of drama, for those taking
part it almost certainly involved little surprise. In the
incestuous world of Japanese politics _ again, as in the society at
large _ few things are avoided so carefully as surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians' staff members in the United States are
responsible for trying to prepare their bosses for every possible
question in advance, in Japan the opposition has courteously
submitted its questions to the governing party two days in advance
of question time.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same thing happened to a foreign journalist when he
arrived for an appointment with a government minister here
recently. A staff member handed him a list of questions that he
suggested be used in the interview. The minister agreed only
hesitantly to answer some others.
</P>
<P>
   What is the purpose of holding a debate at all, one might ask?
Still, the new system might be seen as an improvement over the
traditional parliamentary debates here in which bureaucrats
prepared the questions for both opposition and governing parties,
and then sat and answered them solemnly in testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Question time here is meant to remove some of the immense power
from a bureaucracy discredited by 10 years of economic drift. And
it is intended to give elected politicians more of an air of
involvement in running the country instead of just counting money
and votes.
</P>
<P>
   Although formally democratic, Japan has been a virtual one-party
state for decades, with Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party making
few concessions until its monopoly on power was broken in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, few voters feel strong party affiliation. And many of
the country's political leaders look longingly toward the West,
where stable two-party systems are common and political identities
run deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old one-party system has collapsed, and the new party
system hasn't yet emerged,'' said Gerald Curtis, a professor of
political science at Columbia University who specializes in Japan.
``In the meantime, what can differentiate one party from another in
a society that isn't rent by deep cleavages, whether class or
primordial issues like ethnicity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by copying the British in organizational terms doesn't
mean that you can copy them in terms of free speech and wit and the
skills of parliamentary debate, and that is what question time is
all about. What we are left with is personalities.''

DAVENPORT DOMINATES HINGIS TO CAPTURE CHASE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Public floggings may be illegal, but that's just what
Lindsay Davenport inflicted on top-ranked Martina Hingis Sunday at
Madison Square Garden. Davenport wielded her racquet like a deadly
weapon in a shockingly one-sided 6-4, 6-2 victory in the final of
the Chase Championships, and Hingis, who usually thinks her way out
of intimidating situations, never came close to escaping this one.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Hingis, the defending Chase champion, had tears
in her eyes when she and Davenport clasped hands across the net
after Davenport's brutally efficient victory, her third consecutive
drubbing of Hingis this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just an awesome way to end the year,'' said a jubilant
Davenport, who forced Hingis to surrender with three aces in the
final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up today I really just wanted to go for my shots,
go for my winners and be the one who was dictating, and I was able
to do it all,'' the second-seeded Davenport said. ``I mean, to beat
Martina four and two is pretty great; it's pretty hard to do it any
worse than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, this year's Wimbledon champion, added: ``I keep
accumulating a lot of big titles. For people who said I may not be
mentally strong enough, (this is) definitely proof that you can
change things around. When I was 20, I really seemed to turn my
career around, and the last three years have just been
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's outcome was a reversal of last year's Chase final. Then
it was Davenport who ended the year with the No. 1 ranking but
Hingis who pocketed the $500,000 winner's check. Davenport's
victory Sunday, in her third Chase final, improved her record
against Hingis to 9-7 and prompted a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have to be afraid of anything right now,'' said
Hingis, whose season included an Australian Open title and
appearances in the finals at the French and U.S. Opens. ``I mean,
she's been injured and she came back out great. Right now I always
could consider her as a top player on the tour. Maybe I was more
consistent over the year, but she was just playing better at this
tournament. Probably that was like her best match against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said it could have been her best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely say it was one of the best ones I've played
in my career, I'd like to think ever,'' she said of a performance
that included nine aces, 36 winners, 12 unforced errors and
conversions on 4 of 7 break chances. ``The whole match, I just
played the way I wanted to play, aggressive and going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport made an exasperated Hingis scramble from corner to
corner for the duration of the 61-minute debacle. The first game of
the match foretold the mauling to come: pushed to break point,
Hingis lost on a vicious forehand drive from Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth game, when an equally vicious crosscourt backhand
on her second break point gave Davenport a commanding 4-1 lead,
Hingis was struggling to control her frustration in front of 14,563
spectators. She hurled her racquet toward a courtside trash can,
plopped down in her changeover chair and buried her face in a
towel. After that brief spate of venting she recomposed herself and
cut Davenport's lead to 4-3, but her hopes of a comeback began and
ended there.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-minute second set resembled a match between a flyweight
and a heavyweight more than a sanctioned bout between the world's
two top female tennis players. Hingis held serve in the opening
game, but her 1-0 lead proved ephemeral. She whiffed on a 98 mph
ace from Davenport in the second game, dropped her serve in the
third, and seemed reluctant to leave the safety of her changeover
chair and absorb the remainder of the punishment her opponent had
in store for her. In the seventh game Hingis dropped her serve at
love to trail, 5-2, and after that she simply stood on the
baseline, eyebrows arched in disbelief, and watched the aces sail
by.
</P>
<P>
   ``My serve was great; everything was great,'' Davenport said.
``Now I have a couple of months to catch her. I'm looking at, maybe
April, I can reclaim the No. 1 ranking.''

JORDAN FREES AND EXPELS 4 JAILED HAMAS LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ending a three-month standoff, King Abdullah of
Jordan freed four imprisoned leaders of the militant Palestinian
movement Hamas on Sunday and hours later placed them on a private
jet bound for the Persian Gulf state of Qatar, Jordanian officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty more lower-level Hamas activists will be freed from
prison soon and permitted to remain in Jordan, officials in Amman
said. But they said that Hamas offices in Jordan, which the
government closed by force in August, would not be allowed to
reopen. Officials in Qatar later said that they, too, would
prohibit the Hamas leaders from carrying out any political
activities in their country.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsion appeared to give Abdullah's government a clear and
relatively cost-free victory in its confrontation with Hamas, which
it accused of engaging in clandestine paramilitary training and _
more worrisome for the monarchy _ of penetrating local
fundamentalist opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Jordanian officials adamantly denied that the crackdown
had been conducted at the behest of Washington or Israel. But they
acknowledged that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, had asked
Amman to take action against what he saw as a dangerous source of
rebellion against his peace negotiations with Israel. The Hamas
office in Amman had openly urged the sabotaging of peace talks with
terrorist attacks inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   When reports surfaced on Saturday about a possible expulsion, a
Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Ismail Abu Shanab, said the action would
provoke ``a serious deterioration in the relationship between
Jordan and the Palestinians,'' more than a million of whom live as
refugees in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hamas headquarters in Gaza had already quietly agreed to
cease open political activity in Jordan, officials in Amman say.
And leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, Jordan's largest opposition
party, which loudly championed the cause of the Hamas leaders,
declined to criticize the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The four Hamas leaders expelled were Khaled Meshal, the chief of
the Hamas politburo; Ibrahim Ghoshesh, the local Hamas spokesman;
and two other key politburo members, Abdul Aziz-al-Umary and Sami
Khatter.
</P>
<P>
   The government first issued arrest orders for Meshal and
Ghoshesh when they were traveling in Iran in August. But in what
was seen as a deliberate challenge to the government, they flew
home, and were promptly arrested. Aziz al-Umary was arrested two
weeks ago in what was read locally as signs of new pressure on
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah told reporters in Amman last month that the fate of the
imprisoned Hamas leaders would be decided ``in the courts.'' But he
made it clear that he preferred to avoid a long public
confrontation with the movement. Equally, though, the Jordanian
government could not afford to back down once it publicly accused
the Hamas leaders of offenses that were tantamount to treason.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Jordanian officials portrayed the Hamas office in Amman
as a renegade operation with seemingly closer ties to Iran than to
the Hamas headquarters in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   And they remain angered at the way that Meshal was elevated to
heroic status among many local Palestinians by his survival of a
botched Israeli assassination attempt several years ago. Their aim
has been to remove the Hamas leaders from the scene permanently but
quietly, without creating ``new martyrs,'' one official said.

CZECHS REMEMBER IRON CURTAIN'S BAD OLD DAYS WITH CARDBOARD
`MUSEUM' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Ten years after the Velvet Revolution,
which quickly ended 40 years of totalitarian rule here, Prague
residents found themselves back in grim communist reality during
the weekend, complete with interminable lines in shops, abusive
police officers, arrogant bureaucrats and brainwashing propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least for one day. As part of last week's anniversary
celebration, the revolution's former student leaders organized an
Open-Air Museum of Totalitarianism to remind their fellow citizens
of the former regime.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, a small cardboard village erected overnight on
Wenceslaus Square, embodied the conditions that people used to hate
and ridicule in private but accepted in public. All day Saturday,
large crowds braved freezing temperatures and waited patiently to
get a taste of the old times.
</P>
<P>
   There was the half-empty fruit stand stocked with rotten
oranges, the cheating butcher selling steaks under the counter, the
abrasive post-office clerk who just would not produce the right
rubber stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think you are doing here, huh _ disperse!''
shouted one of the men who walked around dressed in communist
police uniforms. ``Public gathering is illegal. Don't you know
anything?'' he yelled, waving his truncheon at the laughing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bananas?'' the fruit seller asked. ``No, comrade, try
tomorrow. Here, why don't you get these Cuban oranges instead?'' He
slapped one tiny moldy orange on the scale, pushing it down with
the other hand. ``That's a pound and a half, 15 Czechoslovak
crowns, please.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the next stand, a military instructor showed people how to
wear their gas masks and to protect themselves against attack by
Western imperialists.
</P>
<P>
   At another booth, visitors crowded around the meat shop, empty
except for a pig's head sitting next to a plaster bust of Klement
Gottwald, Czechoslovakia's first communist president and an ardent
Stalinist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to Gottwald!'' one customer shouted merrily. The butcher
looked around in mock horror and said in a hushed voice: ``Out of
my store! I don't know you, I never heard you. Out. Out!''
</P>
<P>
   At the next booth, an office, visitors could pick up an
application for Communist Party membership or fill out a request
for hard currency, should they dare to ask for permission to travel
to a non-socialist country. A pale clerk with a red tie was
stamping the forms next to a paper plate with cigarette ashes and
the remains of a hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Red was everywhere. There were red posters, red Soviet flags,
red jackets on books with titles like ``The Leading Role of the
Communist Party in the Modern Czechoslovak Socialist State'' and,
of course, the red star on the hats of police and People's Militia
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internationale'' and other hits of the socialist era
sounded in the background, repeatedly interrupted by two girls
representing Socialist Youth reciting celebratory poems about the
Soviet Union, workers and the brave soldiers who fearlessly
defended beautiful socialist Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said Jan Halouska, 18, a student from Prague.
``It reminded me how we used to have to march in those gas masks at
school. It's good fun now, but when I remember those days when I
was a kid it gives me goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors said people should be reminded more often of the
absurdity of the previous regime, so they would cherish freedom
more.
</P>
<P>
   Bibiana Klimesova, 60, from the eastern town of Pardubice, said
similar shows should be organized in every town and village. If
people remembered the past, they wouldn't vote for the communists
now, she said, referring to the recently increased support for the
Communist Party in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Czechs outside Prague got a dose of the old regime as well.
Czech TV's second channel broadcast a 24-hour compilation of old
socialist programs, so viewers could tune in to ``Festival of
Political Songs,'' ``Let's Learn Russian'' and a television movie
called ``A Skirt, but a Green One,'' about a talented secondary
school student who gave up her boyfriend and opposed her parents to
be able to attend a military university.
</P>
<P>
   Gaps between shows were often bridged with still shots of
wallpaper patterned with playful kittens or an image of the Prague
Castle.
</P>
<P>
   The program was also shown in Slovakia, the country that formed
half of Czechoslovakia under communism before it split peacefully
on Jan. 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at these programs again, I wondered how I could
ever have watched them without throwing up,'' said Fero Fenic, the
creator of the television project. ``We tend to idealize those
times now and keep forgetting what they were really like.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Watching the smiling crowds pouring into the Museum of
Totalitarianism, its main organizer, Jan Bubenik, said, ``For me,
it's a look through a vale of tears. We can laugh now, but it sure
wasn't funny 10 years ago.''

IN TV INTERVIEW, BUSH CLARIFIES VIEWS ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas made clear his strong
opposition to most abortions on Sunday and implied that while he
would not, if elected president, make that viewpoint the principal
consideration in appointing Supreme Court justices, he might not
dismiss it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know how a judge feels about a lot of issues,'' Bush
said in a live, hourlong interview with a television journalist,
Tim Russert, on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he would probably not accept any invitation to
meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization of Republican
homosexuals with whom Bush's chief rival for the Republican
presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, recently met.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that does is create a huge political, you know, nightmare
for people,'' Bush said. He added that he opposed not only gay
marriage but also adoption by gay partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that society ought to aim for the ideal,'' Bush
said. ``And the ideal is for a man and woman to adopt children.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Bush's first appearance during his presidential
campaign on a Sunday morning talk show, and it underscored many of
his socially conservative views, including his faith in abstinence
as an antidote to teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush was careful, as he has been in the past, to suggest
that he is more interested in extolling his views through the bully
pulpit than in imposing them through law.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, for example, Bush said, ``I would support a
constitutional amendment with the exceptions of life, incest and
rape. I want to tell you something, though. The country is not
ready for a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no chance, at this moment, that there be a two-thirds
vote out of the House and Senate,'' Bush continued, referring to
the votes needed to pass an amendment, as opposed to the simple
majority required for passage of a bill. ``What I will do is
promote life as president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Bush had not done a live television interview of this
length since he announced his candidacy in June, the appearance was
widely anticipated as a chance to see how nimbly he could negotiate
an array of policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded with a calm, confident performance throughout the
interview, which was broadcast from the governor's mansion in
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush had just given a foreign policy speech on Friday
and had previously drawn criticism for several gaffes when talking
about international affairs, Russert did not dwell long on global
matters.
</P>
<P>
   When Russert delved into the turmoil in Russia, Bush seemed to
sidestep a few specifics. Russert noted that Bush had said
previously that change in Russia would come from new leaders.
Russert asked Bush who those leaders were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in specific,'' Bush said. ``Our country shouldn't pick
winners on the Russian political scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert also asked Bush if he had any opinion of Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, a possible successor to President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't,'' Bush said. ``I will if I'm the president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russert revisited the question of whether Bush had ever used
illegal drugs, and Bush again declined to answer. He said that
adults should not be making confessions that give children any
justification for self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that to keep Social Security solvent, he might
consider raising the age of eligibility as members of the populous
baby-boom generation retire.
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing himself from many Republicans on Capitol Hill,
Bush said he would favor federal legislation to allow Americans to
sue health maintenance organizations, but only if those
organizations had made treatment decisions that ignored the
recommendations of independent review panels.
</P>
<P>
   Bush grew particularly animated after Russert read from a book
written by Naomi Wolf, an adviser to the presidential campaign of
Vice President Al Gore, that recommended teaching young people to
masturbate rather than engage in sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic,'' Bush said, later adding that ``the federal
government ought to spend at least as much on abstinence as it does
on other attempts to reduce teen-age pregnancies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the folks that are saying condom distribution is the
best way to reduce teen-age pregnancies obviously haven't looked at
the statistics,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes that life begins at conception. Russert
asked Bush, who has said he would not use a judge's position on
abortion as a litmus test, if he would nonetheless want to know a
Supreme Court nominee's views on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know: Are we compatible from a philosophical
perspective on a wide range of issues?'' Bush said. ``But the most
important view I want to know is: `Are you a strict
constructionist, Mr. Jurist? Will you strictly interpret the
Constitution?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush went on to praise Justice Antonin Scalia in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Russert noted, ``He is someone who wants to overturn Roe vs.
Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of reasons why I like Judge Scalia,'' Bush said.

MCCAIN DISCOUNTS REPORTS OF WHISPERING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Sunday that he was
not personally aware of any whispering campaign by fellow senators
to suggest that his war experience in Vietnam had left him too
emotionally unstable to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., the national co-chairman of
McCain's bid for the Republican presidential nomination, has said
that such an effort is clearly under way, McCain said he had no
real evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no direct information except hearsay that this kind of
thing is going on,'' McCain said in an interview with the
television journalist Bob Schieffer on the CBS News program ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain repeatedly sought to make light of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, Bob, you have to be half nuts to run for
president,'' McCain said. ``So I accept the charge. I don't know
anything about it. Of course, you hear rumors, you hear things that
are said, you hear quotes in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm sorry this has happened. I have many close and dear
friends in the Senate, and people who I have known and served with
for many years, who I'm sure spring to my defense regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer noted that the newspaper columnist Elizabeth Drew had
identified several Senate Republicans, including supporters of Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who she maintained were spreading the
rumors about McCain. Those senators have denied the contention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, ``I take them at their word, and there's no reason
for me not to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, McCain has surged in polls of voters
in New Hampshire, which has the first Republican presidential
primary. Some surveys put McCain and Bush, the Republican
front-runner, in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has also been dogged by questions from reporters
about whether he has a problem with his temper. McCain has accused
the Bush campaign of promoting those inquiries, a charge that
Bush's aides emphatically denied.
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's associates have said that his opponents were
trying to insinuate that the isolation and torture that McCain
endured as a prisoner of war had left permanent psychological
scars.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer asked McCain whether there was anything in his
background that disqualified him ``from being president, in a
psychological sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Bob,'' McCain replied. ``And the fact is that I'm a far
better man for having had the experience that I had. I learned the
meaning of friendship, and comradeship and love and compassion, and
learned many of my own failings, which continue to this day.''
McCain said that he would release his medical records soon but that
the process was being slowed by the sheer volume of documents, a
legacy of the torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we've got about 350 pages,'' McCain said. ``It's an
orthopedic surgeon's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's relationship with fellow Republicans has occasionally
been a tense one, strained by his maverick positions on such issues
as overhauling campaign finance laws, which he strongly supports.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that on Sunday, he said, ``I have excellent
relationships with most people on both sides of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that, like Bush, he believed that most American
financial aid to Russia should be suspended until Russia ceases its
attacks on the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said he shared Bush's opposition to gay adoption and
gay marriage. But he said he had met with a gay Republican group _
something Bush has not done _ because ``We are an inclusive party,
and we should maintain the principles of Abraham Lincoln.''

PROTESTING WAR SCHOOL FOR FOREIGNERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT BENNING, Ga. _ In a small classroom inside a pink building
on this historic Army post, Maj. Pablo Friedrich is learning the
art of war.
</P>
<P>
   A bearish marine from Colombia, he will spend nine weeks here
studying tactical manuals translated into Spanish from the books
used by American officers. Then he will return home as deputy
commander of a marine battalion in Cartagena, rejoining Colombia's
civil war against guerrillas and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he returns as a more professional soldier infused with
American military values or as one trained to wage a more efficient
war of repression is the question at the heart of a roiling
national debate over this training center, the Army's School of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, thousands of protesters led by a Roman
Catholic priest gathered at Fort Benning's main gate just outside
Columbus for the annual protest to demand the closing of the
school, the nation's main training center for Latin American
military and police officers for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a funereal procession of 3,100 protesters marched onto
the post, led by several dozen dressed in black robes and white
masks and carrying wooden coffins they said represented those
killed by graduates of the school. In a peaceful, carefully
choreographed confrontation, the Army stopped them after nearly a
mile, put them on buses and drove them off the post. Fifty-four
protesters were detained and given citations barring them from Fort
Benning for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't teach democracy anywhere by training the military,''
said Joe Morton, a white-haired 63-year-old professor at Goucher
College in Baltimore, moments before he boarded a bus at the post.
``Students who come here are going to go back to their countries
and shoot people like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera announced plans
to make significant changes to the school's curriculum in hopes of
muting growing opposition, especially in Congress, which nearly
voted to close the school this fall. If the protests were an
indication, though, the plans failed to win over the most fervent
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to transform this school,'' the Rev. Roy L.
Bourgeois, the priest who has organized the opposition, told the
protesters on Saturday. ``We are here _ and we need to make this
clear _ to close this school.''
</P>
<P>
   But a visit to the school and the protests suggests that this
has become a debate about how the United States will work with
Central and South American militaries after the tumultuous,
sometimes violent engagement of the past, when Washington
overlooked abuses in the name of fighting leftist insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has become an abstraction to the people out
there,'' the school's commandant, Col. Glenn R. Weidner, said on
Friday, as the first protesters assembled at Fort Benning's main
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera and other officials have strongly defended the school
and its mission, which they say is to promote modern, professional
militaries that respect democracy and human rights. Caldera said
the changes would enhance that, training Latin American officers to
cope with today's problems, from drug trafficking to natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are legitimate security interests that they have,''
Caldera said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said the school's critics are ``willfully ignorant,''
slurring the reputation of the Army with accusations that the
school has encouraged violence against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't teach American soldiers to violate human rights,''
Caldera said, ``and we don't teach soldiers of any foreign
countries to violate human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has become so polarizing, the oratory so extreme,
that it overshadows the teaching that actually goes on inside the
school, located in the old headquarters of the Army's Infantry
School, an elegant three-story building on manicured grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Panama in 1946 and relocated here in 1984, the school
still offers purely military courses in skills like basic combat
and flying helicopters. But since the end of the Cold War, its
focus has shifted. Its catalog now includes courses on computers,
medical care and more mundane matters of organizing a professional
military. Students today spend more time in the classroom than on
Fort Benning's firing ranges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich, whose father was a German U-boat sailor who
immigrated to Colombia after World War II, arrived with four
captains from his country and another from Mexico for a course on
how to plan a defense against a hypothetical invasion. Consulting
Army manuals and scrawling with markers on maps and charts tacked
to the wall, they plotted each step of the ``battle'' with
occasional nudging from their Army instructor, Maj. Jaime F.
Llinet.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich said the course was valuable, exposing him to the
latest in American war tactics. ``We believe it is the most
advanced doctrine in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its history, the school has trained 61,000 students from 23
countries. Today, only students from Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti are
ineligible. The State Department pays students' expenses and
screens applicants for accusations of abuses. The school trains
about 800 students a year in courses that last from two weeks to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   In noncombat classes, as many as a third of the students are
civilians, like Maria Gonzalez Vila, a lawyer with Uruguay's
Ministry of Defense. She just completed a five-week course called
Resource Management. Under Caldera's plan, the school would
increase slots for civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Army has also added training on human
rights. The busiest lecturer on the staff of 288 is the
soft-spoken, erudite Army lawyer who teaches international
humanitarian law, Maj. Antonio Raimondo.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who come for as little as two weeks receive eight
hours of lessons on human rights. The officers who attend the
yearlong ``Command and General Staff Course'' sit through 40 hours.
There is also an annual ``Human Rights Week,'' which in February
will include a case study of the American massacre at My Lai during
the Vietnam War and a tour of Andersonville, the notorious
Confederate prison camp, whose commander was the only officer
hanged for war crimes after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weidner said the graduates who went on to commit abuses were the
exceptions. By the opponents' own count, he said, only 300 to 500
of the school's 61,000 students have been linked to atrocities, in
some cases years after they attended short courses. Those few, he
added, are the ones who did not learn the lessons taught here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel betrayed by them,'' Weidner said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics view the emphasis on human rights _ like the proposed
changes _ as an obfuscation. The school's core is and will be
military training, they say, perpetuating the militaries'
disproportionate role in Central and South American democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the reform line before,'' said Heather A. Dean, a
protest organizer. ``And while they have made some reforms, the
bread and butter is still combat training.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The protests at Fort Benning began 10 years ago with only a
handful of opponents, led by Bourgeois, a Navy veteran who has been
deeply involved in Latin American causes since serving as a
missionary in Bolivia in the 1970s. Since then the protests have
grown, even as the crimes committed by the school's graduates
recede into the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for them to say when it is time to forgive,''
Bourgeois said of the Army's insistence that the school has moved
on from its Cold War role.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 5,000 people attended the November protest.
This year, the Columbus police estimated that there were 8,000, the
largest gathering of people in the city since it played host to
women's softball in the 1996 Olympics. The protest has become such
an event that the city's tourism bureau this year helped arrange
hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   To the school's instructors, the placards depicting blood and
graves and invariably referring to the ``School of the Assassins''
have become uncomfortably personal attacks. Several singled out
remarks by a leading congressional critic, Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., who last week dismissed the planned changes as ``putting
perfume on a toxic dump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a trash dump, then I'm the trash,'' said Llinet,
the instructor. A 19-year veteran, he pointed defiantly,
defensively to a patch on his shoulder that he earned for serving
in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an assassin,'' he added. ``I'm a good old Army guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Llinet, who served as a military trainer in Venezuela, said he
agreed with some of the protesters' underlying concerns. He spoke
of ``social injustice'' in Latin America, particularly the economic
disparities that leave the poor mired in hardship and the elite,
often including the militaries, in control.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the school's training served a valuable purpose by
promoting regional stability, encouraging democracy and minimizing
the possibility of American military intervention, the very thing
the protesters oppose most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we don't have to send American forces to Latin America
because of the students who came here,'' he said. ``If we close the
school, maybe we're going to have to go back to the interventionist
policies of Teddy Roosevelt, because when there is a security
threat in Latin America, you know we're going to be there.''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Many of the items on the block were ordinary enough:
a plastic laundry hamper, card tables, camping gear, clothes,
tools, cookbooks, a sewing machine. Only a few _ a voluminous
collection of books about UFOs, 20 metal-frame bunk beds, a pair of
black Nike sneakers _ offered a hint of their macabre origins.
</P>
<P>
   The items auctioned by county officials Saturday were the last
earthly possessions of the 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult who
killed themselves nearly three years ago in hopes of boarding a
spaceship that they believed was trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. It
was one of the largest mass suicides in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The belongings on sale offered no insight on what had led their
former owners to believe that the path to the heavens began with a
lethal mix of barbiturates, vodka and apple sauce. There were 183
lots, which included television sets, videocassette recorders, a
camcorder and three cars.
</P>
<P>
   About 375 people came to bid with a mix of gallows humor,
indifference and ignorance. Their reasons for bidding ranged from
basic need to morbid curiosity to commercial intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go; this is not for me,'' said David Sauceda, a
40-year-old construction worker who was looking for tools when he
was told the source of the items.
</P>
<P>
   The curators of the Museum of Death, which is expected to open
in Hollywood in January, bought a bunk-bed frame to be used in a
display about cult deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Powell, 34, and his wife, Laura, 29, bought seven bunk beds
that they said they intended to sell on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might go for a couple grand each,'' Powell said. ``You
don't know. There are some weird people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the cult members were discovered on March 26,
1997, in a seven-bedroom house in an affluent suburb, after the
cult's leader, Marshall Herff Applewhite, had sent several people a
videotape in which he said the members would be ``shedding their
containers'' and ``leaving this planet.'' A videotape of the scene
made by investigators from the Sheriff's Department showed the cult
members uniformly dressed in black track suits and black Nike
sneakers, covered with purple shrouds.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was delayed by a probate battle involving two former
members of the group, Mark and Sarah King, who wanted control of
the estate. Though they ultimately lost, the county agreed to sell
them the ``intellectual property'' in the estate _ manuscripts,
artwork, computers and the like, as well as patches bearing the
cult's logo _ for $2,000. Kent W. Schirmer, the chief of San Diego
County's property division, said the Kings wanted to keep the
materials out of the public realm.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the auction will be given to families of the dead
to cover the cost of burial. Schirmer said the crowd was not much
larger than it is for most such auctions and the bidding amounts
were average. By the end of the day the items had fetched nearly
$33,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bidding was heaviest on the books and on the bunk-bed frames,
which generally sold for $110 to $130.
</P>
<P>
   Few in the crowd shared the cult's beliefs or acknowledged a
fascination with death. A man and woman dressed completely in black
and gray determinedly bid several hundred dollars for most, if not
all, of the books in the estate, but refused to speak with
reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Stangeland, a collectibles trader who holds a certificate
in mortuary science, said she bought one of the bed frames because
she was fascinated by cults and the power their leaders exert over
members. But she added: ``I don't want to sound morbid because I'm
really not. If God would alter the universe so people could live
forever, I'd be kicking my heels up.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward C. Songer, 66, a federal telecommunications worker, said
he bid on boxes of crimping tools, wires and phone cards because he
was able to pay $60 for items that would normally cost about $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just for my occupation, it's for my life,'' Songer said.
``It doesn't bother me where they came from.''
</P>
<P>
   But some voiced discomfort with the origin of the items.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Benavides, 25, said he wanted to buy a VCR because his had
broken down, and maybe a piece of memorabilia as well. But his
wife, Jennifer, 21, said she was unsure if she would allow
something like that in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Most people said they bid in the hopes of owning a novel, if
grim, piece of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd piece of San Diego history, but it happened here
nonetheless,'' said Andrew Shaw, a 27-year-old college student who
also bought a bed frame. He said he would put it in his guest
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   But would he sleep on it? ``Absolutely not,'' he said.

BOWDEN DRIVES A BUS WITH ONE STOP TO GO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ He sat on a bench in the front of the locker
room looking every bit of his 70 years. Sweat trailed down the side
of Bobby Bowden's face. Half dressed kids 50 years younger talked
to the television cameras, baby-faced trainers gathered up soaked
uniforms from the floor while men and women toting notebooks
stepped around him.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State coach had his arms crossed and had the
perfectly implacable look of a retiree waiting at a bus stop
beneath a palm tree en route to whiling away an afternoon. For 34
seasons, Bowden has found a post-game perch to wait for ``his
boys'' to dress and hit the bus.
</P>
<P>
   On 303 occasions, the coach has been pretty satisfied waiting on
his team, knowing they played well enough to win another game. On
this Saturday night, Bowden's Seminoles dispatched Florida, 30-23,
on the Gators' Florida Field in front of a record bloodthirsty
crowd of 85,747.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rivalry game between two schools located two hours
apart. It is a game that contrasts personalities and generations:
the mercurial Steve Spurrier, a star quarterback and 1966 Heisman
winner at Florida, versus the country cool Bowden who, in his
telling combines feed-store wisdom with tactical maneuvers learned
from the great military generals of his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a game that for the fifth time in seven years decided
which team got to play for college football's national title. For
the second year in a row, it is the 'Noles who are now 11-0 and
have been ranked No. 1 since before the season kicked off.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that the bus Bowden is now waiting for will
pull up to the New Orleans Superdome on Jan. 4 so the Seminoles can
play in the Sugar Bowl and win the coach his second national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty darn special,'' said Bowden from his bench, where
he was happy to talk to anybody who wanted to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in Bowden's 24 seasons at Florida State, the Seminoles
have finished the regular season undefeated only to lose bowl games
and the championship: in 1979 against Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl
and in 1996 against the Gators in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting to those games with a perfect record is an
achievement. Ask 72-year-old Joe Paterno, whose Penn State Nittany
Lions, after holding the No. 2 ranking for nine weeks, have lost
three in a row. Or the third year coach at Notre Dame, Bob Davie,
whose team won't even play in the postseason after losing to Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps unlike any previous season, Bowden desperately wants
to finish this one with victory No. 304 and a championship. For
one, he is the only coach at his own dinner table that has never
won them all. Son Tommy, now the coach at Clemson, went 12-0 last
year with Tulane. Son Terry, now a television analyst, finished
11-0 at Auburn in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm proud of them, but dadgum, I'd like to get me one of
those,'' said Bowden, repeating one of his stock answers.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason is that Bowden believes this is the best team he
has ever coached. Back in August, before a down was played, he said
as much, then listed the reasons. ``Forget the 20 or 25 NFL
prospects everyone likes to point to,'' Bowden said. ``Sure we are
talented, but this is a mature team. We got Chris Weinke _ a
27-year-old quarterback. I'd like one of those every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got Pete Warrick _ a senior who is going to graduate and
who can do anything on the football field. We got old Sebastian
Janikowski kicking for us and he's not only good, you can't rattle
him. I'd be disappointed if we didn't win them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Florida on Saturday, the coaches' preseason assessment
unfolded like he called it. Weinke threw an interception that was
returned for a touchdown to give Florida a 16-13 lead, but then
Weinke responded by driving the Seminoles the length of the field
for a tying field goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was one kicked by Janikowski from 54 yards, his third of the
day. And Warrick, who played with thunderous reminders about his
misdemeanor guilty plea and two-game suspension for taking deeply
discounted clothes, never let the crowd at The Swamp get to him. He
caught nine passes for 90-yards and ran for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the best team of Bowden's coaching career has also tested
him _ on the field with tentative efforts against Georgia Tech and
Clemson, off it with the Warrick episode, as well as the drug
possession arrest of defensive back Tay Cody. To a fault, Bowden is
unwaveringly loyal to his players.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is generally well thought of among his peers, though he
has absorbed his share of criticism. Early this season, for
example, in the middle of the Warrick and Cody affairs, Virginia
coach George Welsh icily observed that the wheels of justice grind
slowly, if at all, in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the Florida State players recognize that this
has been a difficult season for their coach. In the locker room
Saturday night, linebacker Brian Allen indicated that winning the
Sugar Bowl went beyond fulfilling their own dreams of a national
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some wonderful things happen this season along with
some not so wonderful things,'' Allen said. ``The bad things are
our fault. We owe coach Bowden something better.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in front of the locker room, Bowden brushed off such talk.
His boys were almost dressed and it was almost time to go. He was
reminded again of what Spurrier had said in his post-game
conference. That Florida State ``wasn't as good as it used to be.''
The old coach suddenly looked younger than his 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undefeated,'' he said smiling. ``He ain't.'' &QL;

COLOMBIA EXTRADITES DRUG SUSPECT TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Colombian accused of running a major heroin
smuggling ring was bundled aboard an American government plane in
Colombia on Sunday and flown to the United States. It is the first
time in nearly a decade that Colombia has turned over one of its
own citizens to stand trial in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hailed the extradition of the
30-year-old suspect, Jaime Orlando Lara, the first of 42 drug
suspects being held in Colombian jails awaiting transfer to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it almost certainly means new turmoil for Colombia, the
source of most of the cocaine sold on American streets and a
fast-growing exporter of heroin to the United States as well.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian drug cartels appear to be beginning a new wave of
terrorist attacks in protest over the resumption of extraditions of
drug trafficking suspects to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a car bomb killed eight people and wounded scores
of others in a fashionable shopping district of Bogota, the
capital. The police there said it was a final warning against the
extradition of Lara and the others. Similar violence by the drug
traffickers led the Colombian government to halt extraditions in
1991; the last one before Sunday's occurred in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana, who has won praise from the Clinton
administration as well as large American aid commitments for his
willingness to crack down on the drug trade since he took office
last year, defiantly signed Lara's extradition order only hours
after the deadly bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Pastrana must be commended for his courage and
dedication,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House director
of drug control policy. ``Actions such as today's extradition to
confront the traffickers will send a powerful and helpful signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Parham, the chief spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said that Lara was ``a big deal as far as being a
major trafficker'' but that ``the bigger deal is the resumption of
the extradition process'' by Colombia. ``This is very positive for
law enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has formally authorized the extradition of two other
suspects wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges: a
Cuban, Bravilo Gonzalez, and a Venezuelan, Fernando Jose Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope that Flores will prove to be a valuable witness
against the leadership of the now-defunct Cali cocaine cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Lara, who was flown initially from Bogota to Ft. Laundedale on
the way to New York, is wanted by federal prosecutors in Manhattan
on charges that he conspired to smuggle large amounts of heroin
into the United States and distribute it here.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have charged that at one point his
family-run smuggling ring exported 25 pounds of heroin a week into
the United States through distribution points in New York, Houston
and Miami, usually by hiding it in commercial airliners, sometimes
in passengers' luggage. Lara's two sisters were arrested in the
United States earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian police spokesmen were quoted in Bogota as saying Lara
was in handcuffs on Sunday morning when he was placed aboard a
twin-engine Cessna plane owned by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration. The spokesmen said the heavily guarded suspect,
dressed in jeans and sneakers, had not said a word as he walked the
60 feet across the tarmac to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on an American request, the Colombian police captured
Lara in Bogota last December.
</P>
<P>
   American law enforcement officials say he fled the United States
in July after his sisters were arrested by the Drug Enforcement
Administration. Immigration records, the officials say, show that
he left Colombia 29 times between August 1991 and July of last
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is piecing together a major economic
and military aid package for Colombia intended to support
Pastrana's government as it struggles with a thriving drug trade, a
leftist guerrilla insurgency, right-wing paramilitary forces
fighting the guerrillas and an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the aid package, worth as much as $1.5 billion over the next
three years, is inducing reservations even among some in the
administration, who fear that the United States is being drawn too
deeply into a civil conflict that has left tens of thousands of
Colombians dead in the last four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials say they are desperate to find a
way to stem the flood of Colombia cocaine _ as well as heroin that
is transshipped through Colombia _ into the United States. The CIA
estimated last year that Colombia might have produced as much as
188 tons of cocaine from its own crop, up from 88 tons in 1995.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: CLINTON THE RENAISSANCE GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Brazil)  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ It was a long wait, particularly long because
the bathrooms were placed off limits for security reasons, long
enough even for the Champagne and the caviar canapes to run out,
but when President Clinton arrived he quickly wowed a glittering
audience with visions of a more just world.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was New York University's Florentine retreat, Villa
La Pietra, complete with Donatellos. So it was perhaps inevitable
that the president should turn to the fruitful ferment of the
Renaissance to illustrate his conviction that a similar era of
enriching inventiveness is now being driven by the Internet and a
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is late in the presidency, a time when history books come to
mind. And it was clear throughout a two-day conference on
progressive governance that began Saturday night at the Villa La
Pietra that he sees an important part of his legacy in the
reinvention of center-left politics that he has called the Third
Way.
</P>
<P>
   The central themes of Clintonian Third-Wayism have become
familiar: fiscal discipline in the place of tax-and-spend
profligacy; investment in education and new technologies;
opportunity for all and responsibility from all.
</P>
<P>
   The vindicating U.S. statistics were liberally showered on
Europeans still struggling to generate some growth: lowest
unemployment in 30 years, lowest poverty rate in 20, first
back-to-back budget surpluses in 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, in addition, a much greater opportunity to spread the
benefits of this renaissance more broadly than it could have been
spread 500 years ago,'' Clinton said, adding that achieving this
``requires us to go beyond the competing models of Industrial Age
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister who still has a
penchant for the socialist ideas that grew out of the Industrial
Age, among them the notion that socialism must be critical of
capitalism, was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Back resolutely turned, he declined even to look at Clinton,
keeping his chair pointed in the other direction, toward the
somewhat bemused visage of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who
prefers to call his updated social democracy the New Middle.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call the reinvented left, the French do not seem to
like it much. Such newfangled gatherings as this Florentine
get-together tend to be seen by French Socialists as an insidious
trans-Atlantic attempt to take over their preferred global forum,
the Socialist International, where Clinton's Democratic Party does
not tread.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Benigni, the Oscar-winning director of ``Life is
Beautiful,'' had no such qualms. Celebrities, of course, are part
of the new left's vote-winning package, not least in Hollywood, so
Benigni was there to hear about social democracy's new politics of
empowerment and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   To the evident astonishment of Blair, he leapt into Clinton's
arms, showering the president with kisses. A slightly red-faced
Clinton then introduced the British prime minister, who shook the
Italian actor's hand. Life is indeed beautiful when the Third Way
leads to Florence.

<P>
   So beautiful that John Sexton, the dean of the New York
University School of Law, could not resist calling the dinner ``a
quintessentially global moment,'' before announcing that the ``New
York University Global Law School Leadership Award'' would be
presented to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton rose, walked toward the podium, accepted a small
plaque, smiled for the cameras _ and said nothing. A few words from
the first lady had been anticipated, and in this land of
graciousness, her silence did not go unremarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought it would be presumptuous to say anything in front
of so many world leaders, and also for her to be the only first
lady to speak,'' said Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser to the
president. But some present suggested that the fracas over her
recent meeting in Israel with Mrs. Arafat had inclined Mrs. Clinton
to see wisdom in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other first ladies present was Cherie Blair, whose
unexpected pregnancy at the age of 45 has inspired the German
popular press to urge the chancellor _ childless despite four
marriages _ to follow the Blairs' example. Doris Schroeder, who has
opted not to move to Berlin from Hanover, was conspicuous by her
absence.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting much concerned with the aging populations of Europe
and the United States _ Clinton pointed out that over the next 30
years the number of people over 65 in America would double _ the
Blairs were complimented by the European Union Commission
president, Romano Prodi, for their ``heroic efforts'' to bolster
the active population.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that many challenges like aging populations are
shared ones, Europeans and Americans opted to differ over their
models of society, with Prodi saying that Europe must reform but
also defend ``its social model'' and what he called the greater
justice and equity of the European welfare state.

<P>
</P>
<P>
   There is an optimistic view of globalization among center-left
leaders and there is a pessimistic one. The optimists, and they
include Clinton and Blair, say that if the opportunities created by
a global economy are well managed, they will benefit mankind and
eventually advance equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give people access to technology, a lot of smart people
figure out how to make a lot of money,'' Clinton said, adding that
this would be just as true in Africa as it has been in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimistic school, or at least the cautious one, was led
here by Jospin, with some support from Massimo D'Alema, prime
minister of Italy, and the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, whose country suffered a battering from global financial
panic too recently to feel confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still huge divides within nations and among nations,
and we have to meet this challenge of inequality,'' Jospin said
Sunday, arguing that modern global capitalism engendered more
inequality than the capitalism of the early part of this century.
``We have to accept a networked world, but not a world dominated by
networks, because then it would be dominated by private
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's turn to look skeptical. Private interests, of
course, are what make America tick.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Blair argued passionately that so long as
workers' rights, the environment and ideals of inclusiveness are
not forgotten while an open, global economy is promoted, the fruits
of wealth will one day be spread wide.
</P>
<P>
   So long, the president insisted, as fiscal conservatism
prevails. ``Part of the liberal left program is now to balance the
budget,'' Clinton said. ``We are now the parties of fiscal
discipline, because that brings interest rates down, creates jobs,
lowers interest rates on mortgages and car loans, and so helps
ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-Cold War world of the left really has changed: fiscal
tight-fistedness, the argument now goes, actually helps the poor.
Turning to Cardoso, the president added, ``If we all run a surplus,
that makes it that much cheaper for Enrique to get money in
Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple, really. If only everyone on the center-left understood.
But, to judge by the meeting here, not everyone gets Clintonomics.

<P>
   FORT BENNING, Ga. _ In a small classroom inside a pink building
on this historic Army post, Maj. Pablo Friedrich is learning the
art of war.
</P>
<P>
   A bearish marine from Colombia, he will spend nine weeks here
studying tactical manuals translated into Spanish from the books
used by American officers. Then he will return home as deputy
commander of a marine battalion in Cartagena, rejoining Colombia's
civil war against guerrillas and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he returns as a more professional soldier infused with
American military values or as one trained to wage a more efficient
war of repression is the question at the heart of a roiling
national debate over this training center, the Army's School of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, thousands of protesters led by a Roman
Catholic priest gathered at Fort Benning's main gate just outside
Columbus for the annual protest to demand the closing of the
school, the nation's main training center for Latin American
military and police officers for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a funereal procession of 3,100 protesters marched onto
the post, led by several dozen dressed in black robes and white
masks and carrying wooden coffins they said represented those
killed by graduates of the school. In a peaceful, carefully
choreographed confrontation, the Army stopped them after nearly a
mile, put them on buses and drove them off the post. Fifty-four
protesters were detained and given citations barring them from Fort
Benning for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't teach democracy anywhere by training the military,''
said Joe Morton, a white-haired 63-year-old professor at Goucher
College in Baltimore, moments before he boarded a bus at the post.
``Students who come here are going to go back to their countries
and shoot people like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera announced plans
to make significant changes to the school's curriculum in hopes of
muting growing opposition, especially in Congress, which nearly
voted to close the school this fall. If the protests were an
indication, though, the plans failed to win over the most fervent
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to transform this school,'' the Rev. Roy L.
Bourgeois, the priest who has organized the opposition, told the
protesters on Saturday. ``We are here _ and we need to make this
clear _ to close this school.''
</P>
<P>
   But a visit to the school and the protests suggests that this
has become a debate about how the United States will work with
Central and South American militaries after the tumultuous,
sometimes violent engagement of the past, when Washington
overlooked abuses in the name of fighting leftist insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has become an abstraction to the people out
there,'' the school's commandant, Col. Glenn R. Weidner, said on
Friday, as the first protesters assembled at Fort Benning's main
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera and other officials have strongly defended the school
and its mission, which they say is to promote modern, professional
militaries that respect democracy and human rights. Caldera said
the changes would enhance that, training Latin American officers to
cope with today's problems, from drug trafficking to natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are legitimate security interests that they have,''
Caldera said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said the school's critics are ``willfully ignorant,''
slurring the reputation of the Army with accusations that the
school has encouraged violence against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't teach American soldiers to violate human rights,''
Caldera said, ``and we don't teach soldiers of any foreign
countries to violate human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has become so polarizing, the oratory so extreme,
that it overshadows the teaching that actually goes on inside the
school, located in the old headquarters of the Army's Infantry
School, an elegant three-story building on manicured grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Panama in 1946 and relocated here in 1984, the school
still offers purely military courses in skills like basic combat
and flying helicopters. But since the end of the Cold War, its
focus has shifted. Its catalog now includes courses on computers,
medical care and more mundane matters of organizing a professional
military. Students today spend more time in the classroom than on
Fort Benning's firing ranges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Friedrich, whose father was a German U-boat sailor who
immigrated to Colombia after World War II, arrived with four
captains from his country and another from Mexico for a course on
how to plan a defense against a hypothetical invasion. Consulting
Army manuals and scrawling with markers on maps and charts tacked
to the wall, they plotted each step of the ``battle'' with
occasional nudging from their Army instructor, Maj. Jaime F.
Llinet.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich said the course was valuable, exposing him to the
latest in American war tactics. ``We believe it is the most
advanced doctrine in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its history, the school has trained 61,000 students from 23
countries. Today, only students from Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti are
ineligible. The State Department pays students' expenses and
screens applicants for accusations of abuses. The school trains
about 800 students a year in courses that last from two weeks to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   In noncombat classes, as many as a third of the students are
civilians, like Maria Gonzalez Vila, a lawyer with Uruguay's
Ministry of Defense. She just completed a five-week course called
Resource Management. Under Caldera's plan, the school would
increase slots for civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Army has also added training on human
rights. The busiest lecturer on the staff of 288 is the
soft-spoken, erudite Army lawyer who teaches international
humanitarian law, Maj. Antonio Raimondo.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who come for as little as two weeks receive eight
hours of lessons on human rights. The officers who attend the
yearlong ``Command and General Staff Course'' sit through 40 hours.
There is also an annual ``Human Rights Week,'' which in February
will include a case study of the American massacre at My Lai during
the Vietnam War and a tour of Andersonville, the notorious
Confederate prison camp, whose commander was the only officer
hanged for war crimes after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weidner said the graduates who went on to commit abuses were the
exceptions. By the opponents' own count, he said, only 300 to 500
of the school's 61,000 students have been linked to atrocities, in
some cases years after they attended short courses. Those few, he
added, are the ones who did not learn the lessons taught here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel betrayed by them,'' Weidner said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics view the emphasis on human rights _ like the proposed
changes _ as an obfuscation. The school's core is and will be
military training, they say, perpetuating the militaries'
disproportionate role in Central and South American democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the reform line before,'' said Heather A. Dean, a
protest organizer. ``And while they have made some reforms, the
bread and butter is still combat training.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The protests at Fort Benning began 10 years ago with only a
handful of opponents, led by Bourgeois, a Navy veteran who has been
deeply involved in Latin American causes since serving as a
missionary in Bolivia in the 1970s. Since then the protests have
grown, even as the crimes committed by the school's graduates
recede into the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for them to say when it is time to forgive,''
Bourgeois said of the Army's insistence that the school has moved
on from its Cold War role.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 5,000 people attended the November protest.
This year, the Columbus police estimated that there were 8,000, the
largest gathering of people in the city since it played host to
women's softball in the 1996 Olympics. The protest has become such
an event that the city's tourism bureau this year helped arrange
hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   To the school's instructors, the placards depicting blood and
graves and invariably referring to the ``School of the Assassins''
have become uncomfortably personal attacks. Several singled out
remarks by a leading congressional critic, Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., who last week dismissed the planned changes as ``putting
perfume on a toxic dump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a trash dump, then I'm the trash,'' said Llinet,
the instructor. A 19-year veteran, he pointed defiantly,
defensively to a patch on his shoulder that he earned for serving
in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an assassin,'' he added. ``I'm a good old Army guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Llinet, who served as a military trainer in Venezuela, said he
agreed with some of the protesters' underlying concerns. He spoke
of ``social injustice'' in Latin America, particularly the economic
disparities that leave the poor mired in hardship and the elite,
often including the militaries, in control.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the school's training served a valuable purpose by
promoting regional stability, encouraging democracy and minimizing
the possibility of American military intervention, the very thing
the protesters oppose most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we don't have to send American forces to Latin America
because of the students who came here,'' he said. ``If we close the
school, maybe we're going to have to go back to the interventionist
policies of Teddy Roosevelt, because when there is a security
threat in Latin America, you know we're going to be there.''

IN OCCUPIED CHECHNYA, ORDER WITHOUT ALLEGIANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia _ As the Russian army closes in on Chechnya's
besieged capital, Grozny, it is using a fresh strategy: promising
Chechens that their bedraggled towns will be spared a relentless
bombardment if they surrender to Russian forces, then attempting to
secure loyalty by restoring services like gas and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But this month's capture of Gudermes, Chechnya's bleak but
strategically important second largest city, shows it is one thing
to scare Chechen civilians into submission, and quite another to
win their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   City residents wander muddy streets past decaying buildings,
which are still pockmarked from the shells and bullets of
Chechnya's 1994-96 war. Many seem exhausted, and frustrated that
Islamic militants who are based in this breakaway Caucasus region
reignited the fighting by invading neighboring Dagestan in August.
Nevertheless, these people view the Russians as an occupying Army.
</P>
<P>
   As the clap of Russian artillery fire rumbled through the hills
on Gudermes' outskirts, Sergei Kuznetsov, a 19-year-old Russian
private, talked about the problem that his army faces in trying to
pacify Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the war is necessary to fight the terrorists,'' he said.
``But sometimes I don't know what we are doing. During the day, the
people in Gudermes smile at us and bring us goodies. But at night,
they are out there shooting at us. I don't know who we are
protecting from whom.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show that they are bringing stability to Chechnya,
Russian authorities took a first group of foreign correspondents to
Gudermes and to meet some of the soldiers who seized the city on
Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The visit revealed the high stakes at play in this war, which
has increasingly infuriated Western donors and led to sharp
exchanges last week at a 54-nation European security conference.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading the Chechens that a Russian occupation offers the
best hope for a peaceful life is central to the military's strategy
of blunting Western criticism and maintaining its hold on Chechnya.
That way, the military can repatriate the 200,000 refugees who have
fled and discourage further guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours spent in Gudermes, a city that appears to have
survived its capture largely intact, suggest that winning over the
Chechens will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Germans occupied the Soviet Union, the Soviets called
them `the fascists,''' said Alisof Kolymanovich, a 44-year-old
former tractor operator. ``Well, we call the Russians, `the
fascists.' If you could talk to everyone in the villages you would
see that 70 percent are against them being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Splayed across the hillsides outside the city, Russia's 247th
regiment laid down the withering artillery fire that helped the
army seize Gudermes and to chase militants out of several nearby
villages. The unit's affable commander, Yuri P. Em, an ethnic
Korean, is an earnest spokesman for the Russian cause.
</P>
<P>
   He noted proudly that Gudermes fell without much of a fight.
Russian forces blockaded the city for two weeks and pounded its
outskirts with artillery and rockets.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chechen fighters fled, the city's leaders, including
Sulima Yamadaev, a Chechen field commander, negotiated an agreement
to turn the city over to the Russians, the colonel said. It is the
sort of conquest the Russian military would dearly like to repeat
as it drives toward Grozny, the stronghold of many rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are tired of war,'' Em said. ``We have more of
a dialogue with the people than during the last war and are getting
good results.''
</P>
<P>
   But the militants have clearly not given up the fight. Near
Gudermes, the constant boom of Russian artillery and Grad rockets
echoed in the distance. The local fighters are said to have taken
up positions in Argun, some 20 miles from here, and in Grozny, 30
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya still has verdant fields and hills. But the countryside
is battle terrain, too: Its land is scarred by trenchlines,
checkpoints of sandbags and bricks and the treadmarks of armored
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Em said his men's morale was high. They have been told the war
will be over soon and that they will receive as much as $1,000 a
month, a small fortune for a Russian soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers said they have not received any money yet. A
soldier earns 810 rubles ($32) a day in combat and 20 rubles ($4) a
day otherwise, and none seemed to know how much of their service
will qualify for combat pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not tell us much,'' said Vladimir N. Degtyaryov, 20,
as leaned against his howitzer. ``They give us two orders: `shoot'
or `stand down.' Then we have a lunch break and shoot again. They
don't tell us where we are going or what we are going to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the soldiers appear to be the hardened veterans Russian
authorities have said they are sending into Chechnya. Many are 19
or 20 years old, and have never seen combat before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the army for 15 months, serving quietly in Stavropol
and then one night we were mobilized and sent here,'' said
Kuznetsov, the 19-year-old private. ``But we have had three months
of shooting and shooting. I really want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gudermes is an eerie, edgy place, peopled by women, children and
gaunt men who look much older than their years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities are making a visible effort to restore some
semblance of a normal existence, including schools and medical
services.
</P>
<P>
   Gas service _ important to survive the winter _ was restored on
Friday. And Anatoly B. Chubais, the former Kremlin aide who heads
Russia's electrical monopoly, swooped through the city Sunday to
announce that electrical power would also be supplied soon.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chubais who turned off the power when the Russian
military campaign began in September, saying that the impoverished
Chechens had not paid their bills.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian armored personnel carriers prowled the streets and
helicopters fluttered overhead, residents gathered in the city
center to greet Chubais and Nikolay Koshman, the Russian
government's representative in Chechnya _ and to talk to the
journalists brought in for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd mingled peacefully, if unenthusiastically, with the
Russian troops who patrol with AK-47s and maintain strict control,
imposing an evening curfew and requiring Chechens to queue up for
permits each time they want to pass through checkpoints on the
city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   In these contacts with lower-level soldiers, enmity can surface,
some residents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior officers understand everything,'' said Osman
Chukayev, a 46-year-old construction engineer. ``But some of the
soldiers are different. I can show a pass from a colonel at a
checkpoint and they might say, `You can't come through. I don't
care who signed it.' And at night some of the soldiers start
shooting. They must be drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old construction worker who gave his name only as Musa
was more menacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Russian troops walk around in groups of five and
they don't have any problems,'' he said. ``But as things become
more normal, they'll start walking around in pairs. Then people
here will deal with them and they will be quietly taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Others insisted they were not looking for any more trouble. They
are weary of the kidnappings that have made Chechnya a largely
lawless and unsafe place for outsiders since the last war ended in
1996, leaving the region's status unsettled, and are glad that
Gudermes, at least for now, is no longer a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel myself a citizen of Russia,'' said Larisa
Bashayeva, a spirited 29-year-old woman. ``My relatives were killed
by Russian planes. But three years ago there was something to fight
for. Now there is nothing left. Only the religious fanatics are
going to fight this time.''

FITTING ENDING FOR A FOUL SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four quarters as a metaphor for 11 games: Riddled
by injuries and lacking leadership, the UCLA Bruins on Saturday
sputtered through the last leg of a forgettable trip.
</P>
<P>
   A season that began with one of the most embarrassing events in
school history (the handicapped-parking scandal) ended with the
first loss to USC in nine years. Talk about a sandwich with bad
meat and rotten bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sick feeling,'' Bruins senior safety Joey Strycula,
his words echoing through a fast-emptying locker room after UCLA's
17-7 loss to USC. ``Things just didn't go our way. Last year, the
ball bounced our way. This year, it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The errant call that gave USC the clinching touchdown was a
fitting end to the Bruins' lost season. Perhaps it was simply the
scales tipping to USC for the first time since 1990. More likely,
it was the last, unforgiving act of cosmic justice for a team that
had 11 players charged with exploiting the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to Saturday's defeat than a blown touchdown
call, just as there was more to the season than humiliating
headlines and two-game suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult season for all of us,'' senior receiver
Danny Farmer said. ``It started last year with (All-American left
tackle) Kris Farris leaving, then the handicapped parking. A lot of
things didn't go our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries and inexperience at quarterback and on the
offensive line, the Bruins struggled all season to sustain drives
and score points. They never got easy touchdowns, never gave their
defense a chance to rest, never gave the opponent a reason to fret.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was no different. The Bruins couldn't run (45 yards),
they couldn't block and they couldn't catch against a stingy USC
defense. They had three plays longer than 30 yards and they
committed five turnovers _ three inside USC's 10 yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries, suspensions and inexperience, the defense
spent the season on the brink. It played well against Oregon and
Washington, poorly against Stanford, Oregon State and Arizona. The
Bruins were fundamentally better than last year but less talented.
They got no help from the offense, they got little help from the
senior class and they never recovered from the absence of starting
cornerbacks Jason Bell, who missed nine games because of a painful
heel, and Marques Anderson, who was suspended for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was no different. The Bruins played hard but couldn't
stuff USC's self-destructing attack. They yielded 214 rushing yards
and would have allowed more than 17 points if not for the Trojans'
red-zone ineptitude. UCLA's third-down defense, last in the
Pacific-10, was porous once again: USC converted nine of 22
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a predictable performance. After an anguishing season and
an emotional victory over Washington the previous week, the Bruins
simply didn't have the manpower, much less the firepower, to keep
their city-series winning streak alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't one thing, it was a little bit of everything,''
defensive end Kenyon Coleman said. ``It's been happening all year,
and because it's a lot of little things, it's hard to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Even against USC. &QL; 
 &QL;

REPORT CARD &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAME: 11 &QL; 
RESULT: USC 17, UCLA 7 &QL; 
RECORD: 4-7 &QL; 
THIS WEEK'S GPA: 2.33 &QL; 
CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.25 &QL; 
QUARTERBACKS: &QL; 
Ryan McCann was solid, nothing more, which means he's got four
months to prep for spring-practice competition with Cory Paus. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS: &QL; 
DeShaun Foster ran hard, but fumble was a killer; also, he didn't
break usual number of tackles. Senior Durell Price finished with
one of his best games (14 yards per touch). &QL; 
C &QL; 
RECEIVERS: &QL; 
Dropped passes by Danny Farmer and Freddie Mitchell evoked memories
of slippery '96 season. USC's defense on Farmer was well-designed.
Tight ends had no catches. &QL; 
D &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE: &QL; 
Another gutsy performance by the Iron Five, but they couldn't match
USC's speed, depth and desire. Trojans had six sacks and Bruins
averaged paltry 1.4 yards-per-rush. &QL; 
D &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE: &QL; 
Kenyon Coleman, who's returning for his senior season, played one
of his best games (nine tackles). Bruins got decent pressure on
John Fox but yielded 214 yards rushing to an average offensive
line. &QL; 
C &QL; 
LINEBACKERS: &QL; 
Ryan Nece (10 tackles) and Robert Thomas were steady again for what
has become UCLA's best unit. Marcus Reese looked like a freshman
(zero tackles). &QL; 
B &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS: &QL; 
Beleaguered DBs played one of their best games, holding USC's
speedy receivers to one catch over 30 yards. Spot starter Julius
Williams was solid. Manning-Kareem Kelly matchup was fun to watch. &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS: &QL; 
Outstanding coverage against USC's talented returners. Nate Fikse
averaged 49 yards per punt. Manning should enter 2000 as No. 1 punt
returner (four for 73 yards Saturday). &QL; 
A- &QL; 
COACHING: &QL; 
Staff made the game plan work for McCann and defensive plan
contained USC's big plays. As for failed trick plays, at least
Toledo's trying something. But in the end, there just weren't
enough bodies to make it work. &QL;

AMINTORE FANFANI, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY, DIES AT 91 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Amintore Fanfani, who was prime minister of Italy six
times and president of the U.N. General Assembly in the 1960s, died
on Saturday after a long illness. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Fanfani, a senator for life, had returned home Saturday morning
after a month's hospitalization for treatment of heart and
breathing problems brought on by the flu.
</P>
<P>
   A major force in the Christian Democratic Party that dominated
Italian politics for half a century, Fanfani held almost every
important political office in Italy except the presidency _ a post
that eluded him twice. In Italy, he was widely respected as a
farsighted politician who was the first Christian Democrat to
attempt an alliance with the noncommunist left.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his appointment as president of the U.N. General
Assembly in 1965 that made him known internationally. Between 1965
and 1968, he worked to improve relations between East and West,
proposing that Communist China be admitted into the United Nations
and meeting with a delegation from Hanoi to push the Vietnam peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Fanfani often spoke of his friendship with President John F.
Kennedy, whom he first met in 1956 in Chicago. He cited with pride
a flattering story told to him by Kennedy's colleagues _ that it
was a book by Fanfani, ``Catholicism, Protestantism and
Capitalism,'' that persuaded Kennedy to dedicate his life to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tuscany, in central Italy, Fanfani was an economics
history lecturer before entering politics. A short man, he was
nicknamed ``professorino,'' or little professor. His political life
started at the end of World War II. In 1946, Prime Minister Alcide
De Gasperi invited him to Rome to become involved in the nascent
Christian Democrats, the party that would lead Italy until the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In De Gasperi's government, Fanfani began to build a reputation
when, as labor minister, he pushed through laws for workers'
housing. In the early 1950s, he served as agriculture minister,
interior minister and foreign minister, introducing liberalizing
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 he tried to form the first center-left government with
the support of the Socialist Party. He defended his measures with
characteristic forcefulness: ``We didn't want to make love with the
Socialists. But we had to reinforce the base of support for the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Luciano Violante, the president of Italy's lower house of
Parliament, was one of many Italian political leaders who praised
Fanfani's legacy, saying that Fanfani's ``strong social measures
helped to free Italy from the weight of backwardness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fanfani had seven children with his first wife, Bianca Rosa
Provaroli, who died in 1968. He remarried in 1975. His wife, Maria
Pia Tavazzani, a writer, survives him.

MATADORS NEED DISCIPLINE, TOUGHNESS, DEDICATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since ``Being John Malkovich'' is a critical hit
at the box office, let's go inside the mind of Jeff Kearin.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin just finished the college football season as the interim
head football coach at Cal State Northridge. In August, he took the
job knowing he would have to re-apply immediately after the
Matadors' final game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Kearin wants to stay, and since the season was not a
disaster, he'll probably shed the interim label in December. So
let's say Kearin becomes CSUN's fourth full-time head coach since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   What are the tasks ahead? Despite losing their head coach and
offensive coordinator six weeks before the season began, the
Matadors finished 5-6. They were 4-4 and fifth in the Big Sky
Conference; CSUN beat every team behind it in the standings and
lost against every team ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Was this weekend's 30-10 loss to Northern Arizona at North
Campus Stadium, Northridge's first loss at home this season, an
ominous sign of the future? Let's pretend to be Kearin for a
moment, go inside his brain and offer our view of a few critical
changes crying to be made.
</P>
<P>
   __ Better discipline.
</P>
<P>
   With the changeover in staff, part-time secondary coach Brent
Huff was the only coach this season who had the same title in 1998;
the players sometimes took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The school-record 121 penalties, for losses of 1,095 yards, were
the barometer for the players' lack of concentration. There was an
increasing need for the Matadors to intimidate their opponents
outside the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the coaches, most of the players who had the
warped sense that a 15-yard personal-foul penalty was a badge of
honor were seniors who finished their eligibility as the clock ran
out against Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   __ Get tougher.
</P>
<P>
   It seems ironic to criticize the Matadors for excessive
penalties, then ask them to become more aggressive. But it can be
done _ within the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin should trash the idea of making CSUN practices light on
hitting, which he attempted to do this season, and let the players
cleanly go after each other.
</P>
<P>
   If a defensive guy can't make a hit all week in practice, he's
going to be antsy to make a mark in the game. Sure, the running
backs and receivers don't look forward to contact from their
teammates, but don't turn them into wimps.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled aggression is the key. The Matadors were rattled this
year by teams which excelled at intimidation: Montana, Portland
State and Northern Arizona. That wouldn't happen if the CSUN
players were seasoned by contact.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dedication to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, Kearin promised to suspend any players who
wore hats or T-shirts displaying other colleges; just watching the
players enter and leave the locker room was like seeing a
sports-apparel catalog in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   All the schools were represented: Notre Dame, UCLA, USC,
Nebraska. . .
</P>
<P>
   This would be fine in the student union. But CSUN's locker room?
We're offering the same advice we offered Kearin in September: Take
some money out of the shoestring budget, order two sets of T-shirts
and hats with the Northridge name and force the players to wear
them. Sometimes a minor detail _ a starting offensive lineman or
linebacker wearing the hat of another football team _ indicates a
big-picture problem.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it, Jeff. Good luck. &QL;

REPORT CARD &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAME: 11 &QL; 
RESULT: Northern Arizona 30, CSUN 10 &QL; 
RECORD: 5-6, 4-4 &QL; 
THIS WEEK'S GPA: 2.62 &QL; 
CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.59 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
QUARTERBACKS &QL; 
Marcus Brady threw more bad passes in this game than he had all
season. He took responsibility for his three second-half INTs, the
first of which ended a drive inside the NAU 20; the last was
returned for a TD. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL; 
A career-best performance for Jaumal Bradley (170 yards) in his
final CSUN game. He averaged 8.1 yards per carry and scored
Matadors' only TD. As usual, not much from anyone else. &QL; 
A &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL; 
Most telling stat: Bradley was CSUN's top receiver, with six
catches. Too many dropped passes and bad routes. Only one guy
(Terrence Jones) with more than 50 yards receiving. That's bad. &QL; 
D &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
The future appears bright for unit with only one graduating senior.
Helped Bradley to career day and allowed Brady adequate time to see
the field. Let's hope for better depth in 2000. &QL; 
A &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Pushed around by NAU's O-line, which is among the best in the Big
Sky. Managed just two sacks on QB Travis Brown, whose white uniform
was relatively clean after the game. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
A combined 22 tackles from Lewis Blanton (eight), Jack Heaslet
(seven) and Cos Abercrombie (seven) is a pretty good total; they
should have done it all year. Abercrombie (one sack) played well. A
good sign for next year for the sophomore? &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
Relatively mistake-free _ until NAU WR Francis St. Paul's
back-breaking 75-yard TD pass in third quarter. The safeties got in
a few good licks on RB Ronney Jenkins, which was inspiring. &QL; 
B &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
Let's give P Ethan Beck credit: The kid can kick. He had a
55-yarder Saturday. K Derek Brown showed strong leg on 39-yard
attempt but missed it. Terrence Jones' punt returning was awful,
again. &QL; 
C &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
A gaffe: relied on a game plan with TE Nate Davenport, who's had a
bad shoulder this season. Davenport was hurt on second play and
didn't return. School-record 121 penalties is an embarrassing
total. &QL; 
C+ &QL;

<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia _ As the Russian army closes in on Chechnya's
besieged capital, Grozny, it is using a fresh strategy: promising
Chechens that their bedraggled towns will be spared a relentless
bombardment if they surrender to Russian forces, then attempting to
secure loyalty by restoring services like gas and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But this month's capture of Gudermes, Chechnya's bleak but
strategically important second largest city, shows it is one thing
to scare Chechen civilians into submission, and quite another to
win their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   City residents wander muddy streets past decaying buildings,
which are still pockmarked from the shells and bullets of
Chechnya's 1994-96 war. Many seem exhausted, and frustrated that
Islamic militants who are based in this breakaway Caucasus region
reignited the fighting by invading neighboring Dagestan in August.
Nevertheless, these people view the Russians as an occupying Army.
</P>
<P>
   As the clap of Russian artillery fire rumbled through the hills
on Gudermes' outskirts, Sergei Kuznetsov, a 19-year-old Russian
private, talked about the problem that his army faces in trying to
pacify Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the war is necessary to fight the terrorists,'' he said.
``But sometimes I don't know what we are doing. During the day, the
people in Gudermes smile at us and bring us goodies. But at night,
they are out there shooting at us. I don't know who we are
protecting from whom.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show that they are bringing stability to Chechnya,
Russian authorities took a first group of foreign correspondents to
Gudermes and to meet some of the soldiers who seized the city on
Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The visit revealed the high stakes at play in this war, which
has increasingly infuriated Western donors and led to sharp
exchanges last week at a 54-nation European security conference.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading the Chechens that a Russian occupation offers the
best hope for a peaceful life is central to the military's strategy
of blunting Western criticism and maintaining its hold on Chechnya.
That way, the military can repatriate the 200,000 refugees who have
fled and discourage further guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours spent in Gudermes, a city that appears to have
survived its capture largely intact, suggest that winning over the
Chechens will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Germans occupied the Soviet Union, the Soviets called
them `the fascists,''' said Alisof Kolymanovich, a 44-year-old
former tractor operator. ``Well, we call the Russians, `the
fascists.' If you could talk to everyone in the villages you would
see that 70 percent are against them being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Splayed across the hillsides outside the city, Russia's 247th
regiment laid down the withering artillery fire that helped the
army seize Gudermes and to chase militants out of several nearby
villages. The unit's affable commander, Yuri P. Em, an ethnic
Korean, is an earnest spokesman for the Russian cause.
</P>
<P>
   He noted proudly that Gudermes fell without much of a fight.
Russian forces blockaded the city for two weeks and pounded its
outskirts with artillery and rockets.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chechen fighters fled, the city's leaders, including
Sulima Yamadaev, a Chechen field commander, negotiated an agreement
to turn the city over to the Russians, the colonel said. It is the
sort of conquest the Russian military would dearly like to repeat
as it drives toward Grozny, the stronghold of many rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are tired of war,'' Em said. ``We have more of
a dialogue with the people than during the last war and are getting
good results.''
</P>
<P>
   But the militants have clearly not given up the fight. Near
Gudermes, the constant boom of Russian artillery and Grad rockets
echoed in the distance. The local fighters are said to have taken
up positions in Argun, some 20 miles from here, and in Grozny, 30
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya still has verdant fields and hills. But the countryside
is battle terrain, too: Its land is scarred by trenchlines,
checkpoints of sandbags and bricks and the treadmarks of armored
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Em said his men's morale was high. They have been told the war
will be over soon and that they will receive as much as $1,000 a
month, a small fortune for a Russian soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers said they have not received any money yet. A
soldier earns 810 rubles ($32) a day in combat and 20 rubles ($4) a
day otherwise, and none seemed to know how much of their service
will qualify for combat pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not tell us much,'' said Vladimir N. Degtyaryov, 20,
as leaned against his howitzer. ``They give us two orders: `shoot'
or `stand down.' Then we have a lunch break and shoot again. They
don't tell us where we are going or what we are going to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the soldiers appear to be the hardened veterans Russian
authorities have said they are sending into Chechnya. Many are 19
or 20 years old, and have never seen combat before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the army for 15 months, serving quietly in Stavropol
and then one night we were mobilized and sent here,'' said
Kuznetsov, the 19-year-old private. ``But we have had three months
of shooting and shooting. I really want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gudermes is an eerie, edgy place, peopled by women, children and
gaunt men who look much older than their years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities are making a visible effort to restore some
semblance of a normal existence, including schools and medical
services.
</P>
<P>
   Gas service _ important to survive the winter _ was restored on
Friday. And Anatoly B. Chubais, the former Kremlin aide who heads
Russia's electrical monopoly, swooped through the city Sunday to
announce that electrical power would also be supplied soon.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chubais who turned off the power when the Russian
military campaign began in September, saying that the impoverished
Chechens had not paid their bills.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian armored personnel carriers prowled the streets and
helicopters fluttered overhead, residents gathered in the city
center to greet Chubais and Nikolay Koshman, the Russian
government's representative in Chechnya _ and to talk to the
journalists brought in for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd mingled peacefully, if unenthusiastically, with the
Russian troops who patrol with AK-47s and maintain strict control,
imposing an evening curfew and requiring Chechens to queue up for
permits each time they want to pass through checkpoints on the
city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   In these contacts with lower-level soldiers, enmity can surface,
some residents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior officers understand everything,'' said Osman
Chukayev, a 46-year-old construction engineer. ``But some of the
soldiers are different. I can show a pass from a colonel at a
checkpoint and they might say, `You can't come through. I don't
care who signed it.' And at night some of the soldiers start
shooting. They must be drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old construction worker who gave his name only as Musa
was more menacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Russian troops walk around in groups of five and
they don't have any problems,'' he said. ``But as things become
more normal, they'll start walking around in pairs. Then people
here will deal with them and they will be quietly taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Others insisted they were not looking for any more trouble. They
are weary of the kidnappings that have made Chechnya a largely
lawless and unsafe place for outsiders since the last war ended in
1996, leaving the region's status unsettled, and are glad that
Gudermes, at least for now, is no longer a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel myself a citizen of Russia,'' said Larisa
Bashayeva, a spirited 29-year-old woman. ``My relatives were killed
by Russian planes. But three years ago there was something to fight
for. Now there is nothing left. Only the religious fanatics are
going to fight this time.''

FEWER TEEN-AGERS SEE DRUGS AS `COOL,' SURVEY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Exclusive; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m.

 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen-age approval of marijuana and other illegal drugs has
started declining, with fewer adolescents saying they consider drug
use to be ``cool,'' according to a national study being released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of teen-agers surveyed agreed strongly that ``kids
who are really cool don't use drugs,'' compared with 35 percent who
said so last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the number agreeing strongly that ``in my school, marijuana
users are popular'' dropped to 10 percent, from 17 percent last
year. Among younger respondents, between 13 and 15 years old, only
8 percent said marijuana users were popular, compared with 13
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is potentially significant because such changes in
attitude have become predicters of drug use. A government survey in
August reported that drug use was leveling off among teen-agers.
The new survey said that experimentation with marijuana declined to
41 percent of those surveyed, compared with 42 percent in 1998 and
44 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Experimentation with inhalants, methamphetamine, cocaine and LSD
also dropped. Trial use of the drug Ecstasy did not.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was commissioned by the Partnership for a Drug-Free
America, a coalition of communications professionals who have
created about 600 advertisements and commercials for a campaign
that the government launched in July 1998 to discourage adolescents
from using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership stopped short of attributing the change in
attitudes to its role in the campaign, suggesting that the decline
in social acceptance of drugs had broader importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board, in numerous statistical measures, teen-agers
are disassociating drugs from critically important badges of teen
identity,'' James E. Burke, the partnership's chairman, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer-marketing standpoint, when this type of peer
norm begins to develop, it's extremely encouraging,'' Burke said.
``But it's too early to declare a major turnaround on drug-related
attitudes and drug use.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study found teen-agers more aware of drugs and the
risks they pose. Forty-five percent of the adolescents interviewed
said they had seen or heard an advertisement against drugs at least
once a day, compared with 32 percent in 1998, when the $195 million
campaign was getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you injected that amount into the marketplace, you would
expect to see something change,'' the partnership's spokesman,
Stephen Dnistrian, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership Attitude Tracking Study, as the annual survey is
called, was developed by Audits and Surveys Worldwide, a marketing
research company in New York. It asked 6,529 adolescents in the
seventh- through the 12th-grades to fill out a questionnaire on how
they felt about drugs. The margin of error was plus or minus 1.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the teen-agers interviewed said they had been
offered drugs. But only 11 percent said it was difficult to reject
a friend's invitation to try marijuana, compared with 14 percent in
the previous four years. And 41 percent of the teen-agers said they
had tried to talk a friend out of using drugs, compared with 38
percent in 1998.

CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT COULD BE FIRST OF MANY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Lawyers say they will file a class-action suit against Microsoft
on Monday on behalf of millions of Californians, in the first of
what legal experts say could become a flood of private litigation
springing from the Justice Department's antitrust action against
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, to be filed by three longtime class-action lawyers,
will accuse Microsoft of using its monopoly in operating systems
software to overcharge buyers of Windows 95 and Windows 98. The
complaint does not estimate the financial impact to Windows users,
but the lawyers are seeking triple damages if the suit leads to an
eventual finding of financial harm.
</P>
<P>
   The big software maker's vulnerability to private suits
increased sharply earlier this month when Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson issued his findings of fact in the government's antitrust
case against Microsoft. Jackson concluded that Microsoft is a
monopoly whose anticompetitive acts have stifled innovation and
harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conclusions of law, a judge's findings of fact in a
federal antitrust case are not generally considered admissible as
evidence in private suits. But Jackson's findings agreed so
strongly with the case presented by the Justice Department and 19
states that antitrust experts say his final verdict, expected early
next year, will almost surely find that Microsoft is a monopoly
that violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest financial threat to Microsoft may come not from
corporate suits, but from class actions on behalf of the millions
of users of the company's industry-standard Windows operating
system. Such consumer suits, legal experts say, have the potential
to cost Microsoft hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps even
billions, in damage claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the start of the race to get to the courthouse,''
observed Stephen Axinn, a partner in Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider who
is an antitrust litigator. ``It could be like the tobacco
litigation, in the sense that you have lots of plaintiffs lawyers
in different states sharing information.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the financial risk from such litigation, according to
legal experts, should be a powerful incentive for Microsoft to seek
an out-of-court settlement in the government case. The chances of a
settlement appeared to increase last Friday when Jackson appointed
Richard A. Posner, a federal appeals court judge and leading
antitrust scholar, as mediator in settlement talks between
Microsoft and the Justice Department and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a flood of private follow-on cases _ with
their triple damages in private antitrust cases _ are lawsuits with
potentials that Microsoft simply cannot ignore,'' said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, publicly at least, Microsoft insists that its risk from
private antitrust suits is exaggerated. ``That litigation is
something we're prepared to defend and defend aggressively, if
necessary,'' said Tom Burt, a Microsoft lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In consumer class actions, legal experts say, Microsoft has
defenses that will lessen its potential liability and present
formidable obstacles for plaintiffs. For example, most computer
users do not purchase Windows directly from retail software stores
in shrink-wrapped boxes. Generally, the operating system is already
loaded on personal computers when they are purchased. An estimated
90 percent of Windows 98 users got it preloaded on new machines.
</P>
<P>
   The legal significance is that a 1977 Supreme Court ruling _ the
Illinois Brick Company vs. the State of Illinois _ declared that
indirect purchasers of goods could not recover damages in
class-action antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, however, 18 states including California and New York
have passed laws allowing indirect purchasers to qualify for triple
damages in antitrust class actions.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jackson's findings do provide a road map for
plaintiffs' lawyers, there remains a lot to prove in court.
Jackson, for example, found that Microsoft has a monopoly, but he
did not say precisely when it achieved monopoly status. He found
consumers were harmed by Microsoft, but the class-action lawyers
must put a figure on how much users were overcharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The econometrics on damages will be very complex,'' Axinn
said. ``There's no question that Microsoft has some good cards to
play on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson provided class-action lawyers with some
tantalizing details. In asserting that consumers may have paid more
for Windows than they would have in a competitive market, he cited
a Microsoft study suggesting possible prices of $49 and $89 for the
retail upgrade to Windows 98. Microsoft chose to charge $89, which
the study identified as the ``revenue maximizing'' price.
</P>
<P>
   ``That portion of the judge's findings was an invitation to a
class-action lawsuit,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official
in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the November 1997 study was
garden-variety pricing analysis. Trying to estimate an optimal, or
revenue maximizing, price is something that every consumer product
company routinely does for each of its offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's discussion of the Microsoft pricing study, according
to Terry Gross of Gross &AMP; Belsky in San Francisco, is ``a clear
marker.'' But, he said, it is mainly the overall drift of Jackson
findings that provides a solid starting point for the class-action
suit that he and his colleagues are filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the judge's findings,'' Gross said, ``he makes it
clear that all Windows users were harmed by paying too high a price
for Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   The class action, which the lawyers plan to file in California
Superior Court in San Francisco, does not specify the number of
members in the class of both individual and corporate users of
Windows. But Gross estimated that the number in California was ``at
least 10 million,'' and he said the suit covers Windows users since
the introduction of Windows 95. The complaint does not estimate the
financial damage to Windows users in California.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a small New York advertising company that
purchased Windows, Seastrom Associates Ltd., sued Microsoft and
sought class-action status to represent thousands of similar
corporate customers in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   But to take on Microsoft in a class action, legal experts say,
will require experience, skill and resources. They note that the
three lawyers behind the California suit _ Gross, Daniel J. Mogin
of San Diego, and Francis O. Scarpulla of San Francisco _ are
experienced state class-action lawyers who have worked for two
decades on antitrust cases involving products ranging from snack
foods to tires.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers say they will continue their litigation even if the
federal case is settled out of court. Jackson's findings of fact
alone, they insist, ease the way for suits like theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A settlement in the government's case wouldn't make our case
go away,'' Gross said. ``We still have these findings that
Microsoft is a monopoly that abused its power by overcharging
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, only a final ruling _ not the findings of fact _ can
be used as evidence in other cases. But a judge's fact findings and
final ruling are ordinarily issued at the same time. Jackson took
the unusual step of separating his findings of fact from his
findings of law, which gave his fact findings greater importance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, legal experts say Microsoft will surely challenge any
attempt by class-action lawyers to build a case on the findings of
fact alone.

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE RULES FOR PROTECTING WORKERS FROM RSI 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is about to propose new
workplace rules that officials said would protect millions of
workers from repetitive-stress injuries, one of the major sources
of physical pain and disability in offices and factories across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the rules would require employers to adopt
full-scale ergonomics programs to minimize workplace hazards if
even a few employees have suffered such injuries. Officials at the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said they planned to
issue the regulations this month.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has been delayed for years as business groups
argued that the standards were unnecessary and too expensive.
Opponents in the House of Representatives tried this year to delay
the rules for further review, and some agencies within the
administration have also voiced doubts. But the White House has
decided to act now, as Congress has left town.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 3, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would
prevent the Labor Department from issuing any new ergonomic
standards until that study was finished. But the Senate has not
approved the legislation, so the Labor Department is free to issue
its rules. The rules will be made final only after a period of
public comment, but federal officials say the comments will not
derail the plan.
</P>
<P>
   One critic, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said the standards
would be ``the most far-reaching regulation ever issued by OSHA.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would try to reduce the burden of
the rules on small businesses. But business groups and their allies
in Congress still vehemently oppose the rules, saying the costs
will far exceed the benefits for most employers.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft of the new rules, OSHA, the federal agency that
regulates workplace safety, insisted that ``ergonomics programs are
cost-effective and feasible'' because they can reduce specific
types of workplace injuries known as musculoskeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   These disorders include strains and sprains, lower back pain,
carpal tunnel syndrome, hernias and other ailments caused by
repetitive motion, overexertion, bending, climbing or crawling.
They cut across blue-collar and white-collar jobs and account for
more than one-third of all serious occupational injuries and
illnesses in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While more research is always welcome, OSHA says, hundreds of
scientific studies in recent years have produced ``overwhelming
evidence'' that these injuries are linked to workplace activities.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA says that more than 600,000 Americans suffer work-related
musculoskeletal disorders each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under ergonomics programs, employers must systematically analyze
the risks of various jobs, change work practices to minimize or
eliminate hazards and provide treatment to employees for
work-related medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial estimate of the benefits and costs of the new
rules, OSHA says employers would have to fix or redesign 4.5
million jobs in the first year, ``and a diminishing number
thereafter.'' These changes, it says, would prevent 32,000 to
95,000 injuries each year.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA, a unit of the Labor Department, said its rules would cost
employers $3.5 million in the first year. One-fourth of the cost
stems from one of the most hotly debated provisions: a requirement
that employers provide full pay and benefits to workers who are
removed from their jobs or reassigned to less strenuous tasks
because of their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Employers would have to maintain such pay and benefits up to six
months. The Clinton administration says this protection is
essential to encourage workers to report their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret M. Seminario, director of occupational safety and
health for the AFL-CIO, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this rule is to catch injuries early, before
they become severe and disabling,'' Ms. Seminario said. ``Workers
won't come forward if they believe they'll lose their jobs or have
their pay reduced. These injuries occur gradually over time. When
they progress to the point of significant disability, they cause
extensive time off the job and are among the most costly of all
workplace injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration, an independent government
agency that analyzes the impact of federal rules on small
businesses, said OSHA had grossly underestimated the cost of its
rules and probably overstated the benefits. The annual cost to
employers could easily exceed $18 billion, the business agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the business agency said that the
guarantee of pay and benefits for injured workers could
significantly increase the number of claims filed for workplace
injuries. ``If this potential is realized,'' it said, ``employees
will benefit from reduced injuries and illnesses, but employers
will experience a net increase in workers' compensation premiums
and related costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fluharty, a spokesman for OSHA, said, ``We expect to
publish the rules as a formal proposal by the end of November.''
The public, he said, will have several months to comment before the
agency issues final rules with the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have been under review at the White House Office of
Management and Budget since July 2. Congressional aides said they
understood that the budget office had questioned some of OSHA's
cost estimates and had suggested changes in the rules to reduce the
costs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under one proposal intended to lighten the burden on small
businesses, an employer could avoid the need for a full-scale
ergonomics program if it quickly corrected a specific problem after
one worker was hurt in an isolated incident. If, for example, a
worker was injured lifting heavy boxes, the employer might be
allowed to make a ``quick fix'' by purchasing a mechanical hoist to
lift the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Congress, the National Academy of Sciences is
investigating whether particular work activities cause
musculoskeletal disorders. The academy said its study would be
completed in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said, ``There is insufficient scientific evidence to
justify a costly new ergonomics regulation.'' Food Distributors
International, a trade association of food wholesalers, said the
rules would require its members to rebuild or reconfigure
warehouses, at a cost of $5 billion, and could force some of them
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we wait for the National Academy of Sciences to
complete its study?'' asked John R. Block, president of Food
Distributors International. ``Why the rush? The administration
wants to finish this regulation before George W. Bush is elected.
Vice President Gore owes a lot to labor unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials denied that they were motivated by politics.
They said they had been concerned about ergonomic issues for more
than a decade. As secretary of labor in 1990, they noted, Elizabeth
H. Dole started to develop ergonomic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Jeffress, the assistant secretary of labor in charge
of OSHA, said scientists had found compelling evidence that
repetitive motions could cause carpal tunnel syndrome, just as
heavy lifting could cause back injuries. Jeffress said employers
were hypocritical in trying to delay and discredit the new
standards, because they knew that ergonomic programs could prevent
injuries, cut costs and improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting with employers, Jeffress said: ``You cry
wolf about ergonomics, while at the same time investing in
ergonomic programs to protect your employees. Have you no shame? Do
you not care about the reputation for misrepresentation that you
are creating for your corporations?''

</P>
<P>
   ``CRYING: THE NATURAL &AMP; CULTURAL HISTORY OF TEARS'' &QL; 
By Tom Lutz (Norton, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only humans sob. Weeping is a peculiarity of man _ no other
animals are known to do it. And yet we know surprisingly little
about it, other than the obvious (children cry more than adults do)
and the physiological (reflex tears _ those you produce when you
peel an onion _ have a different chemical composition from
emotional tears). Crying is an escape, a physical act that
distracts us from the trauma that has made us cry. It is also, Lutz
tells us, a kind of language, ``expressing not just our distress
but our demands, not just our desire to be understood but our
desire to evade detection. Our crocodile tears can be used to
ensnare, to confuse, to extort, to deceive. Even those tears we cry
when we are alone have an imagined audience. Even in our deepest
moments of grief, we can be well aware of the effect our tears are
having on those around us.'' This vastly researched,
interdisciplinary study of tears is a delight, in the tradition of
Diane Ackerman's ``A Natural History of the Senses.'' Lutz looks at
how philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists and sociologists
have interpreted tears over the years. He looks at crying in art
and literature, film and advertisement. He explores the physical
process of crying and its psychological benefits, as well as gender
issues that it raises (powerful women such as Hillary Rodham
Clinton do not cry in public because it could be read as weakness).
He discusses our changing attitudes toward tears, illustrated by
the fact that Edmund Muskie was run out of the 1972 presidential
primary race for crying in front of reporters, whereas Bob Dole,
who remained dry-eyed for the first 40 years of his public life,
cried many times over the past decade without consequence. Finally,
Lutz poses another puzzle: Even if we think we know why we cry, can
we explain why we stop? ``Tears,'' he writes, ``are the most
substantial and yet the most fleeting, the most obvious and yet the
most enigmatic proof of our emotional lives.'' &QL;

``THE LADIES AUXILIARY'' &QL; 
By Tova Mirvis (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This compassionate first novel is the story of the women of an
Orthodox Jewish community in Memphis, Tenn., and their relationship
with a free-spirited woman _ a convert to Judaism _ who comes to
live among them. Batsheva is the widow of Benjamin Jacobs, who has
been killed in a car crash in New York. Hoping to ease her
loneliness and preserve her ties to him, Batsheva brings their
5-year-old daughter to the Memphis community in which Benjamin grew
up. From the start, it's obvious to the other women that Batsheva
does not fit in _ she does not cook or clean, nor does she pay
suitable attention to the modesty of her clothing or to the
dictates of Jewish tradition. But she does bring an understated
self-confidence, a passion for delving into the questions that
religious faith inspires, and a sympathy for the community's young
people, who crave freedom from the obligations to which they were
born. Mirvis tells her story in the collective voice of the Jewish
ladies, a ``we'' that reflects the depth of their traditions, the
vulnerability of those traditions in the modern world and the
oppressive standards that have grown up around them. Mirvis never
loses her compassion for these characters, nor does she ignore the
value of their moral and religious commitments. They are gossipy
and judgmental, yet oddly innocent. And in coming to terms with
their feelings about Batsheva, the women begin to question
themselves. This is a gentle story _ no sex, violence or overt
drama _ written with a deft hand and a sympathetic heart. Mirvis,
who grew up in the Memphis community on which her novel is based,
says her novel is ``emotionally autobiographical.'' &QL;

``MISS MANNERS' GUIDE TO DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY''By Judith Martin
(Crown, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The formidable arbiter of taste and tactics turns her eyes to
the home front, where civility often meets the fate of a dead
goldfish. She begins, of course, with the ticklish affairs of the
people of the home front, known as ``The Family.'' This chapter is
so complex, given today's divorce and remarriage statistics, that
New &AMP; Notable had to take notes just to keep up. But Miss Manners
has everything under control. Other headings include ``The Help,''
``The Visitors'' and ``Entertaining the Relatives.'' Our favorite
parts are not Miss Manners' essays on these matters, but the
questions she receives from her gentle readers and the answers she
gives, in which she shows herself capable of gutting a cloddish
correspondent without even a trace of discourtesy. We love Miss
Manners, yes we do. We would suggest, however, that she has written
many books (12); that the overlap is conspicuous; that being
content with one's already considerable fortune is a gracious thing
indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LIKELY STORY'' &QL; 
By Rosemary Mahoney (Anchor, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Miss Manners would wring her hands over Rosemary Mahoney.
There is no civility in this memoir (now new in paperback) of the
summer of 1978, when the 17-year-old Mahoney worked as a domestic
for the woman she thought was her idol, Lillian Hellman. Hellman
was irascible, insulting, bossy, cheap and pathetic. Mahoney was a
teenager, and so not much more pleasant than her employer. The
difference is that Hellman is dead and Mahoney is alive to tell the
tale. Neither woman looks good, although it is Hellman who suffers
the indignity of having her 73-year-old body described through the
eyes of an angry young girl. This is what Miss Manners would
whisper in Rosemary Mahoney's ear: Someday, you will be old. &QL;

QUENTIN CRISP, WRITER AND ACTOR ON GAY THEMES, DIES AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quentin Crisp, the British-born writer, raconteur and actor who
found fame at 59 when he published ``The Naked Civil Servant,'' an
account of his openly homosexual life in London, and who found
happiness when he moved to New York at 72, died Sunday in
Manchester, England. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp was in Britain for a new run of his one-man show ``An
Evening With Quentin Crisp,'' which was to have opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant Crisp gained attention in the United States in
1976 when a dramatized version of ``The Naked Civil Servant,''
starring John Hurt as Crisp, was shown on U.S. television to
enthusiastic reviews. In The New York Times John J. O'Connor wrote
that it was ``a startling, thoroughly fascinating portrait of one
of those exotic creatures who adamantly refuse to behave `properly'
in this world, thereby making the rest of us examine our own
behavior to a closer and often more valuable extent.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident of New York's East Village since 1977, and of the
same single-room-occupancy building on Third Street since 1981,
Crisp was a neighborhood celebrity known for his wardrobe of
splashy scarves, his violet eyeshadow and his white hair upswept a
la Katharine Hepburn and tucked under a black fedora. His nose and
chin were often elevated to a rather imperious angle, and his
eyebrows were painstakingly plucked. When he played the role of
Queen Elizabeth I in Sally Potter's 1993 film ``Orlando,'' Village
residents bowed before him on the sidewalks as he passed.
</P>
<P>
   He was so well known for the prickly wit that had earned him
comparisons to Oscar Wilde that he regularly received mail
addressed to ``Quentin Crisp, New York City, America.'' After a
lifetime of being pointed at, snickered at, even spat at, Crisp
learned to welcome attention, even to court it.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Crisp was born Denis Pratt on Christmas Day, 1908, in
Sutton, a London suburb. He was the youngest of four children born
to a lawyer and a former nursery governess. In ``The Naked Civil
Servant,'' Crisp, who changed his name as an adult, wrote of a
tortured upbringing and young adulthood at the hands of a
vociferously homophobic society. But rather than live
unobtrusively, he decided in his early 20s to dedicate his life to
``making the existence of homosexuality abundantly clear to the
world's aborigines.''
</P>
<P>
   He made a career of flaunting his effeminate manner and dressing
in women's clothing, and for such provocations, he would be
rejected and even physically assaulted. ``I suppose it's logical,''
he said. ``I abuse them, they defile me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find employment in 1930s London, he resorted to
prostitution. With his mother's help he eventually found work as a
book illustrator before beginning to model nude in subsidized art
schools on a government stipend; hence the title of his
autobiography. ``Maybe it's true that artists adopt a flamboyant
appearance,'' he once observed. ``But it's also true that people
who look funny get stuck with the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp performed ``An Evening With Quentin Crisp''
off-off-Broadway at the Players Theater in 1978, and it earned him
a special Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Eder, reviewing the production for The New York Times,
said Crisp had offered ``a witty, touching and instructive
evening,'' adding: ``Despite his extravagances, perhaps because of
them, there is nothing sectarian about Crisp. Both in words and in
his fussy, faintly self-mocking gestures, he asserts his identity.
But what he draws out of it is universal: gaiety _ in the original
sense of the word, for once _ and themes common to all of us: the
need for courage and individuality, and the ground of tragedy on
which they are exercised.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his books are ``How to Have a Lifestyle'' (Methuen, 1979),
``How to Become a Virgin'' (St. Martin's, 1984) and ``Resident
Alien'' (Alyson Publications, 1997), a compilation of his pieces
for New York Native, the gay newsmagazine.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp was famous for never turning down a party invitation or a
free meal. But despite his gregarious social nature, he was fond of
claiming that he had never fallen in love. ``You can fancy someone,
wish them well or enjoy their company,'' he said. ``That's all I
can do with anybody. But when Miss Streisand sings, `People who
need people are the luckiest people in the world,' she's being
funny. When you need people, you're finished. I need people, but
not any one person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman in England once told me, `All people are the same to
you.' But that's not true,'' he continued. ``They're different but
equal. I've spread my love horizontally, to cover the human race,
instead of vertically, all in one place. It's threadbare, but it
covers.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves no immediate survivors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moving to the United States, Crisp maintained, was his proudest
achievement. He loved Americans, he said, for ``their belief that
personality is the greatest power on earth.'' One anecdote he often
told had him standing on Third Avenue, dressed and made up as usual
when a passer-by stopped. ``When he noticed me, he said: `Well, my!
You've got it all on today!' And he was laughing. In London people
stood with their faces six inches from mine and hissed, `Who do you
think you are?' What a stupid question. It must have been obvious
that I didn't think I was anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   As cherished a character as he was by many, Crisp had his
detractors, especially gay men of younger generations who decried
his claim that gay pride was an oxymoron. ``It's not normal to be
gay,'' Crisp said, ``and I think it's very weird to think that it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why gay people want to be separate but equal,
anyway,'' he said in a 1997 interview. ``That means they want to be
cut off from nine-tenths of the human race. `I have nothing in
common with them,' they say. Why, you have everything in common but
the funny way in which you spend your evenings.''
</P>
<P>
   His provocative comments aside, Crisp's homosexuality was always
front and center in the way he lived, filtered through his
particular mix of pride, anger and wit. ``When I was coming to
America,'' he recalled, ``I went to the American Embassy in
Grosvenor Square, and the man asked me, `Are you a practicing
homosexual?' And I said I didn't practice. I was already perfect.''

TITANS DEFEAT STEELERS, 16-10 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ There were 3 minutes 15 seconds left, the
Pittsburgh Steelers had the ball at their 9-yard line and trailed
the Tennessee Titans by 16-10 at Adelphia Stadium Sunday.
Pittsburgh, with no timeouts remaining, was a 91-yard drive away
from seven points to win it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Steelers might as well have been 91 million miles away.
</P>
<P>
   A Kordell Stewart pass for 3 yards. An incomplete pass. A pass
for 9 yards and a first down. A sack by rookie end Jevon Kearse for
a 2-yard loss. And then an interception by defensive end Kenny
Holmes. Five plays. The Steelers moved from their 9 to their 19 and
crashed. Game over. No thrilling drive, no drama, no comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh offense seemed ill equipped to provide it. It was
smacked silly for most of the afternoon by the Tennessee defense in
the Titans' victory, which pushed them to 8-2 and dropped
Pittsburgh to 5-5. Tennessee controlled the one-on-one battles,
stopped running back Jerome Bettis, made Stewart look troubled on
the game's biggest plays and made Pittsburgh look like a shaky team
in danger of not making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make the big plays when we needed to and we put
ourselves in a hole on third and second downs,'' said Bettis, who
rushed for 88 yards, including 35 on one early first-quarter run.
``They were pretty tough. The bottom line is the team over in the
other locker room outplayed us. It's frustrating. We have to keep
scratching and get some wins. We can run the table, and we've got
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh scored a touchdown on its first possession and added
a field goal with seven minutes left in the game. In between, the
offense labored. This was Pittsburgh's fifth game in which it
scored 17 or fewer points. And this loss comes on the heels of its
embarrassing defeat last week at home to the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee scored touchdowns on its first two drives _
quarterback Steve McNair ran for 2 and 3 yards _ and that proved
enough to handle the Steelers and to continue the Titans' amazing
streak. They have won 12 consecutive division games. Tennessee's
last loss in the AFC Central was on Sept. 27, 1998, to
Jacksonville. Sunday's victory was also the franchise's fourth
straight over Pittsburgh, the first time it has accomplished that
since this series began in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting closer,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. ``We
talked about playing in different phases and I saw improvement in
every area from this team today. We're in a situation where we just
have to keep going. I saw a lot of good things out there today.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw Tennessee jump ahead by 14-7 at halftime and then gain a
safety in the third quarter to lead by 16-7. McNair, only a few
weeks removed from back surgery, took punishing licks on his
scoring runs but continued to play efficiently. Safety Marcus
Robertson made 11 tackles and played a tenacious last line of
defense. Kearse continued to create chaos for the Steelers'
offense. The Titans' defense made five sacks, their offense did not
allow one and their special teams allowed only 4 yards on returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are streaking. The Steelers are sinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's telling us, `You guys don't have this, you guys
don't have that,' when in actuality we have as much talent as
anybody else,'' Pittsburgh linebacker Levon Kirkland said. ``We're
out there with a team who hasn't lost but two games. They are a
top-ranked team in the AFC and we stuck right with them to the very
end. We've just been hearing that we can't do it for so long and
believing the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win all six to close. We can do that and be in
the thick of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Not without scoring more points. Pittsburgh needs its offense to
make more timely, game-swinging plays. It needs fewer penalties (11
Sunday), and a lot of breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want guys thinking that the season is over,
because we're not losers,'' Pittsburgh safety Lee Flowers said.
``We have too much talent to be losers. We did not believe that
we'd be in this situation in the preseason. We thought we'd be a
lot better off. We have two options: we can either give up the rest
of our games or come out and play with some pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride is not the issue. It's points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to come in and win with their defense,''
Titans running back Eddie George said. ``But balance wins in this
league.'' &QL;

ON PRO BASKETBALL: SPREWELL PLAYS HIS ROLE TO PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The profanity tumbled from his mouth
unfailingly, until the final horn blared and his team had won. Some
of it was tossed in the direction of belligerent courtside fans,
some at the players assigned to guard him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out there,'' said Antawn Jamison, the Golden State
Warriors forward. ``I haven't seen anyone go off like that in a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell, the mercurial New York Knicks guard, was less
a basketball player on Saturday night than he was a vulgar
talk-show guest, summoned to boost sagging ratings. The Arena in
Oakland swelled with people who either loved him or loathed him and
felt nothing in between.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's play was all over the map, but he deposited a
malicious dunk in the fourth quarter of the Knicks' 86-79 victory
over the Warriors _ his first game against the coach he choked two
years ago and the franchise he contends let him down.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was asked, after scoring 14 points but missing 11 of 17
shots and swearing up a storm, whether he thought he had behaved
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I had fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell avoided the glance of P.J. Carlesimo, his former coach.
He glared into the stands and toward the Warriors' bench after each
shot he made. He was good in his role. Very good.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dennis Rodman nor Bill Laimbeer _ not even a youthful
Jesse Ventura _ could have played the villain this convincingly.
Spewing vulgarities one moment, charming reporters the next, one of
the N.B. A's best-known players kept climbing the charts less than
a year after his exile from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's detractors thought he showed no class by not making
up publicly with Carlesimo, by showing up everyone in the building.
His supporters equated the Knicks' victory with vindication for all
the supposed emotional anguish he had been through. They hollered
for him and against him.
</P>
<P>
   And they watched. They all watched.
</P>
<P>
   In Woody Allen's movie ``Celebrity,'' the most telling and
amusing scene involves a Jerry Springeresque free-for-all. Onstage,
white skinheads and black activists angrily collide. Backstage, in
the privacy of the green room, the warring factions politely
discuss their preferences in bagels _ proving that it is all about
sweeps week.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell comes from a New York director's cut, but not the one
you might think. He is less one of Spike Lee's defiant and
persecuted black men than he is straight out of Allen's
imagination: a Zelig willing to play whatever role society gives
him.
</P>
<P>
   There were two defining moments of Saturday's game: Sprewell
having his shot and his body sent to the floor by Warriors center
Adonal Foyle, and Sprewell throwing down that fourth-quarter dunk
and posing in front of the Golden State bench.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell caused so many visceral reactions. He exchanged taunts
with fans and trash-talked with players; he pounded his chest,
flexed his torso, scowled and swore for nearly two hours. Even an
unassuming Warriors rookie was taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took it a little bit too far,'' Damon Jones said. ``It's OK
to come out and play hard and let guys know you're in the building.
But I think he could have tuned it down. My opinion means nothing.
But personally, I would have liked to see him come out and shake
P.J.'s hand and show a little bit more class out on the floor. Cut
down the antics and play basketball. His antics seem to take a
little bit off his game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only about the game for Sprewell. All week, he acted
like an emotionally wounded kid whose team had been run off the
court, vowing revenge. He came back with a new and more talented
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston knocked down jumpers; Chris Dudley and Marcus
Camby put back missed shots. As the Knicks built a 20-point
first-half lead over an inferior team, Sprewell was not by himself
against the world anymore. He pumped his fist at the end, his
romanticized retribution on the playground complete.
</P>
<P>
   He had won, and all that many of his peers could do was shake
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all gets old after a while,'' said Terry Cummings, the
38-year-old Warrior who jawed with Sprewell at one juncture. ``You
got to get past that. I even said that to him on the floor. It
can't be fun when you're that angry. You can't do what you love to
do, and that's just to play ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked what Sprewell thought of his advice. ``He said he
was all right,'' Cummings said with a rueful smile. The veteran
laughed at the sound of his own words, the way a man laughs when he
knows someone is unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   Home or away, no matter where he plays, Spree is on Broadway now
_ an entertainer apart from the famous franchise for which he
plays. He is becoming Rodman, minus the tattoos and with many more
skills. A celebrity, waiting in the green room to rescue sagging
ratings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen-age approval of marijuana and other illegal drugs has
started declining, with fewer adolescents saying they consider drug
use to be ``cool,'' according to a national study being released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of teen-agers surveyed agreed strongly that ``kids
who are really cool don't use drugs,'' compared with 35 percent who
said so last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the number agreeing strongly that ``in my school, marijuana
users are popular'' dropped to 10 percent, from 17 percent last
year. Among younger respondents, those 13 to 15 years old, only 8
percent said marijuana users were popular, compared with 13 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is potentially significant because such changes in
attitude have become predictors of drug use. A government survey in
August reported that drug use was leveling off among teen-agers.
The new survey said experimentation with marijuana declined to 41
percent of those surveyed, compared with 42 percent in 1998 and 44
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Experimentation with inhalants, methamphetamine, cocaine and LSD
also dropped. Trial use of the drug ecstasy did not.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was commissioned by the Partnership for a Drug-Free
America, a coalition of communications professionals who have
created about 600 advertisements and commercials for a campaign
that the government began in July 1998 to discourage adolescents
from using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership stopped short of attributing the change in
attitudes to its role in the campaign, suggesting that the decline
in social acceptance of drugs had broader importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board, in numerous statistical measures, teen-agers
are disassociating drugs from critically important badges of teen
identity,'' James E. Burke, the partnership's chairman, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer-marketing standpoint, when this type of peer
norm begins to develop, it's extremely encouraging,'' Burke said.
``But it's too early to declare a major turnaround on drug-related
attitudes and drug use.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study found teen-agers more aware of drugs and the
risks they pose. Forty-five percent of the adolescents interviewed
said they had seen or heard an advertisement against drugs at least
once a day, compared with 32 percent in 1998, when the $195 million
campaign was getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership Attitude Tracking Study, as the annual survey is
called, was developed by Audits and Surveys Worldwide, a marketing
research company in New York. It asked 6,529 adolescents in the
seventh- through the 12th-grades to fill out a questionnaire on how
they felt about drugs. The margin of error was plus or minus 1.8
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the teen-agers interviewed said they had been
offered drugs. But only 11 percent said it was difficult to reject
a friend's invitation to try marijuana, compared with 14 percent in
the previous four years. And 41 percent of the teen-agers said they
had tried to talk a friend out of using drugs, compared with 38
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While some popular music has been criticized for glamorizing
drugs, a minority of the adolescents, or 42 percent, agreed that
rock and rap stars made drug use look tempting, compared with 48
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In what the partnership called another encouraging development,
30 percent of the teen-agers said they had learned a lot about the
risk of drugs from their parents, compared with 27 percent last
year. The government's National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has
also used advertisements to urge parents to talk with their
children about the dangers of drug use.

EDITORIAL: THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Now that Congress has adjourned, and the presidential campaign
is heating up, it is worth noting some shifts in voter attitudes.
These adjustments do not seem obvious to Republican congressional
leaders in Washington. They remain wedded to their anti-government
approach of tax cuts above all. They are also at a low ebb in
public confidence, according to a spate of recent polls. These
surveys affirm the conventional wisdom that national elections are
in the main a battle for control of the political center. But they
also show that the center contains new combinations of voters whose
loyalties are not firmly tied to either party.
</P>
<P>
   The polls demonstrate that while Americans are wary of
government, they no longer rage over its excesses. Good times are
surely the driving force behind the current mood and a general
impulse toward generosity and social concern. The word ``liberal''
is still one that many voters resist, but the automatic opposition
to government intervention in the lives of Americans espoused by
Ronald Reagan and central to the strategy of Newt Gingrich and Tom
DeLay appears to have run its course, even among some
self-identified Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A recent comprehensive voter survey by the Pew Research Center
shows that a newly strengthened bloc of Republicans, about a third
of the party, leans toward more government involvement in the
environment, education, health and helping the poor. In fact, even
many ``populist'' Republicans who care about social issues like
abortion and school prayer are not necessarily anti-government in
other areas that affect the middle class. That helps explain why
Gary Bauer, the Christian-right candidate, favors more regulation
of health maintenance organizations. It also helps explain why Gov.
George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, the leading Republican
presidential contenders, are doing little to espouse the 1980s
Republican agenda still pushed by Trent Lott, the Senate majority
leader, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds advantageous for the Democrats, but their claim to a
redefined center is not automatic. According to the Pew survey,
Gore is falling short among conservative Democrats turned off by
President Clinton's personal behavior. These are the old so-called
Reagan Democrats, many of them religious family people won back by
the president in the last two elections. But now they are upset
about the president's behavior and not convinced that Gore shares
their concerns. Bill Bradley does about as well as Gore against
Bush, but he also is having trouble winning support among Reagan
Democrats. His apparent strategy of running to the left of the vice
president on some issues could hurt rather than help him on that
score.
</P>
<P>
   This attitudinal unrest is working against congressional
incumbents in both parties. For all this era's prosperity and
contentment, voters are oddly unhappy with the posturing of their
leaders in Washington. After being turned off by the impeachment
scandals and the pummeling that both sides carried out one year
ago, the voters seem to have found the fiscal confrontations of the
last year equally unedifying. As the campaign accelerates, they
seem to want moderation in political approach and personal conduct
worthy of respect. The candidates who embody these qualities seem
more likely to succeed than at any time in the recent past.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
In early August, everything seemed right at Texas A&AMP;M. Nearly
everyone was picking the Aggies to repeat as the Big 12 South
champions. In some quarters, there was talk of a possible run at a
national title.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aggies coach R.C. Slocum, always the realist, inserted this note
of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Do not, Slocum warned, focus only on the 16 starters the Aggies
were returning from their 11-3 season. Do not, he said, overlook
what the Aggies lost.
</P>
<P>
   As the season unfolded and unraveled, it was clear the Aggies
missed the likes of linebackers Dat Nguyen and Warrick Holdman,
safety Rich Coady, tight ends Dan Campbell and Derrick Spiller and
guards Cameron Spikes and Rex Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   On the field and off, those Aggies were the heart and soul of
the team that upset Nebraska and Kansas State on the way to the Big
12 championship. This year, the lack of leadership seemed to be one
of the major problems that prevented Texas A&AMP;M from capturing a
third straight Big 12 South title.
</P>
<P>
   During times of adversity, leaders are expected to step forward
and lead. It's unlikely many college teams have faced the sort of
adversity the Aggies will when they play at Kyle Field on Friday.
The memory of the Aggie Bonfire collapse and the death of 11
classmates and a former student remains fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the fact the game is between archrivals, it didn't
figure to have much meaning this year. The Longhorns already have
locked up the Big 12 South title. But now the Aggies, who endured
criticism that they were too soft after losses at Texas Tech,
Oklahoma and Nebraska, get a final chance to show their resolve
and, at the same time, honor the memory of their deceased brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people gave their lives to help build a bonfire to
support us,'' said A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown. ``We want to match
that effort when we go out on the field. Those people have
supported us so many years, the biggest thing we could give back to
them is a victory over Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown is a senior who stands for what is good about being an
Aggie. He tried his best this season to make this his team. He
played through a painful shoulder separation and poured his
intelligence, emotions, ability and toughness into an attempt to
shore up the Aggies when the season went south in October.
</P>
<P>
   The words of caution spoken by Slocum as early as the Big 12
media gathering in early August began looking prescient even as the
Aggies were winning their three non-conference games. Even when
healthy, their offensive line lacked the experience and depth of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   When left tackle Shea Holder suffered a season-ending knee
injury in the third game of the season, a series of reserves
shifting around the line eventually limited the Aggies' ability to
run the football.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, there were red flags about the Texas A&AMP;M
offense. The Aggies have had a season-long inability to score in
the first quarter _ they didn't manage an offensive touchdown in
the opening 15 minutes until Game 10 against Missouri. They
couldn't punch the ball into the end zone once inside the red zone,
too often relying on field goals.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to diversify their offense by throwing more, the
Aggies somehow lost the ability to run the ball _ a traditional
staple in their attack. Not until the 10th game of the season did
an Aggies back gain more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum's coaching also came under attack. In a 21-19 loss at
Texas Tech on Oct. 4, the Aggies seemed unprepared to stop Red
Raiders running back Sammy Morris, who came out of dry dock and
rushed for more than 100 yards. After that lackluster loss, the
national championship dreams were history.
</P>
<P>
   Home victories over hapless Baylor and Kansas appeared to right
the ship, but the next three weeks were perplexing. The Aggies went
to Oklahoma and were embarrassed 51-6. Privately, the Oklahoma
coaches were amazed the Aggies didn't make defensive adjustments as
the onslaught raged on.
</P>
<P>
   After that loss, Slocum plainly addressed the team's lack of
leadership. Again, he spoke of the talent last year's seniors took
with them _ six ended up playing in the NFL _ and their ability to
pick up everyone around them by making big plays at the right
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have six players off this team go to the NFL,'' said
Slocum. ``We lost a lot of talent. It's been a concern that no one
has stepped up and filled in the leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown did his part. In a team meeting the day after the
Oklahoma game, he and several other seniors called for solidarity
among the Aggies. McCown told the team he wanted to know who was in
the boat and who wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   McCown was at the helm. Though he suffered a separated left
shoulder against Oklahoma, he played the next week in a 21-3 win
over Oklahoma State. After the game, McCown broke down and cried
while addressing the media. After a week of hearing how he wasn't a
leader and how the Aggies were on the verge of falling apart, the
win had drained his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was stunning. With their season on the line,
the Aggies went to Nebraska and were blown out again, losing 37-0.
The Cornhuskers gave the Aggies every chance to pull off an upset
with first-half fumbles and mistakes, but the Aggies couldn't
block, couldn't run and, after a spirited early defensive effort,
couldn't tackle.
</P>
<P>
   In consecutive Big 12 road losses, the Aggies were outscored
88-6. The revamped offense wasn't clicking. The Wrecking Crew
defense was wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   And the day after the Nebraska loss, all hell broke loose in a
team meeting, pointing up that at least one Aggie didn't want to be
in the proverbial boat any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Senior tailback Dante Hall, the Aggies' leading rusher the last
two seasons, and Slocum engaged in what sources say was a testy
exchange that began when Slocum admonished Hall for repeatedly
parking his car in a no-parking zone on campus. Hall was said to
have made a remark that angered Slocum, and the coach told Hall to
leave the meeting, kicking him off the team.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had been unhappy much of the season. With subpar blocking
by the line and fullback Ja'Mar Toombs, his numbers had suffered.
He wondered aloud about the blocking earlier in the season, which
did not win friends in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   A back injury and ankle injury cut into his playing time. Hall
was expected to be one of the Aggies' leaders this year. Instead,
he missed the final two regular-season games and whatever bowl the
Aggies will be invited to.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear: The Aggies won't play in a major game as
they did last January when they lost to Ohio State in the Sugar
Bowl. In August, they had designs on the Sugar Bowl again, where
this year's national champion will be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Those dreams vanished in three road losses in a six-week span.
This week's game against Texas initially was to have been merely a
test of the Aggies' ability to regroup after a disappointing
season.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's Bonfire tragedy, it will provide one final
chance for the leaders to step forward and guide a team that will
bring a scattershot of emotions onto Kyle Field.

A FINAL GOAL FOR GRETZKY, AND IT'S A BEAUTY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ When it comes to Wayne Gretzky, there is always room
for another honor. On Monday night here, not far from his hometown
of Brantford, Ontario, Gretzky will be accorded the greatest honor:
enshrinement in the Hockey Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The icing on the cake,'' is how the 38-year-old Gretzky
described his induction while speaking during the first
intermission of the Rangers' 4-3 overtime loss to the Maple Leafs
on Saturday night. ``It's something that tops off the whole
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who was honored in a pregame ceremony Saturday, retired
last spring after 21 professional seasons, 20 in the National
Hockey League, the last three of which he spent with the Rangers.
He won the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's most valuable
player, nine times, eight of them consecutively, beginning with the
1979-80 season.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Lemieux, the last player for whom the mandatory three-year
waiting period for induction to the Hall of Fame was waived, ended
Gretzky's stretch in the 1987-88 season. So Gretzky went out and
won the Conn Smythe Trophy, awarded to the most valuable player in
the playoffs, for the second time in his career in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest playmaker of his time, Gretzky won the Art Ross
Memorial Trophy, for leading the league in scoring, 10 times,
including seven in a row, beginning with the 1980-81 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky retired either having set or shared 61 records, and he
had four Stanley Cup championship rings with the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, after visiting with his former Ranger
teammates, Gretzky called the four cups the highlight of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we won, we were so young that we didn't realize what we'd
really done,'' Gretzky said, referring to the stretch in the 1980s
when Edmonton won four cups in five years. ``When you're 23 years
old, you think you're going to do it every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pocklington, who was Edmonton's cash-strapped owner at the
time, sold Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings after the 1988 finals.
Surprisingly, Gretzky said that was not the most disappointing
moment of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was reality of life,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest regret?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stanley Cup final we lost with Los Angeles,'' Gretzky
said, referring to the Kings' surprise run in the spring of 1993,
which culminated in a five-game series and another cup for
Montreal. ``That was probably the biggest disappointment of my
career. By then, I had gotten to a stage in my career where I
really understood the makeup of talented, great teams. I understood
we weren't a great team, but we'd pulled it together at the right
time. And then we got beat three games in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky would never see the finals again.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Gretzky came to another cup was the 1996-97 season,
his first with the Rangers, his last playing alongside Mark
Messier. That season, the Rangers advanced to the Eastern
Conference finals. The following off-season, Messier departed via
free agency after a bitter contract dispute. The Rangers have not
been to the playoffs since.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Gretzky said in a televised interview that he would
have come back for this season had the Rangers acquired Pavel Bure.
On Saturday, Gretzky attempted to explain just what he had meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more or less because there was so much talk about Pavel
coming to the Rangers,'' Gretzky said, referring to all the rumors
before Bure was traded from Vancouver to Florida last Jan. 17. ``My
experience playing with the Rangers was nothing but wonderful. My
comment was made on the basis of, if Pavel came to New York, I
probably would have felt more loyalty to the organization to play
another year. If they were going to bring in a guy like that to
play with me, there would have been more pressure on me to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said he had no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have my skates,'' Gretzky said. ``They took my
skates to the Hall of Fame. If I would have taken them home, my dad
would have probably stolen them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gretzky admitted, ``I miss it a great deal.''

EDITORIAL: A MORE OPEN IMF  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, the self-assured but often criticized managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, announced his
retirement earlier this month and already a handful of European
officials are busy choosing his successor. French, German and
British officials regard the appointment as theirs to make despite
the fact that managing directors make decisions that decide the
fate of taxi drivers in Indonesia, small shop owners in Ecuador,
taxpayers in Thailand and farmers throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the decision is up to the fund's executive board,
which is dominated by the Western industrialized countries but at
least includes representatives from everywhere else. But the
board's role is shaping up as largely ceremonial. The fund's
managing director is too important to be chosen in secret by a few
self-selected European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The fund comes to the rescue of countries in financial distress,
offering billions of dollars of loans if they adopt stringent
economic reforms. It currently oversees about 50 such programs in
Latin America, Africa, the former Soviet Union and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the fund's programs often cause needless economic
pain. The fuicted its intervention in Asia in 1998 would
lead to a quick turnaround. Instead it led to economic collapse,
though Asia now appears to be on the mend. Many of the countries in
sub-Saharan Africa remain buried in debt and poverty despite two
decades of fund-supervised economic reform. In Russia and Brazil,
the fund wasted billions of dollars, and delayed reforms, by
propping up currencies. In both cases, the currencies collapsed
anyway. The fund claims, perhaps correctly, that these countries
would be in even worse shape if they had not had its assistance. It
also points to several countries from the former Soviet Union that
it has helped move to markets.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's policy prescriptions affect people around the world.
It decides whether to bail out Ecuador or let its economy slide. It
decides whether Korea should defend its currency in the face of a
looming depression by doubling interest rates. It decides whether
to crack down on insolvent Indonesian banks, throwing the economy
into a tailspin, or to prop up possibly corrupt or bankrupt
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these decisions, says Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist
of the World Bank, puts different groups _ workers, small shop
owners, bankers or foreign investors _ at risk. Because economists
often can provide no clear answers, the managing director has
leeway to decide which groups get bailed out first or at all. The
question that hangs over the current selection process is whether
the decisions the fund made that temporarily crushed Asia's
economies would have been made the same way had the managing
director been publicly accountable to a wider audience than just
his fellow finance officials.
</P>
<P>
   The process clearly needs to be broadened. One prominently
mentioned plan for opening up the process, proposed by Jeffrey
Sachs of the Harvard Center for International Development, would
have the fund's board appoint a panel of outside experts to
nominate qualified candidates from around the world. The candidates
would then publicly state how they would change fund policy. Would
they back flexible or fixed exchange rates? Would they continue to
have the fund ride herd on dozens of countries each year? After
hearing the candidates, the board would vote publicly.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other ways to accomplish the same goal of opening
the fund's deliberations to public scrutiny and forcing candidates
to state for all the world to hear how they would handle the
managing director's responsibilities. The IMF's recent history
shows that the managing director has become too powerful to be
selected in secret any longer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every once in a while, Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., says, he shows up to address some Democratic fund-raising
event out in the country and the people awaiting him smile politely
and ask, ``When is the congressman getting here?''
</P>
<P>
   His detractors, in fact, have long delighted in calling him
``congressboy.'' Just 27 when he was elected to the House from
Rhode Island, Kennedy at 32 still has the look of the young advance
man who arrives to make sure that the room is nicely packed before
the real Kennedy arrives. But Kennedy has a grown-up job these
days, as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He and his mentor, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority
leader, are leading a drive to win a Democratic majority in the
House next year. To do that, the party needs money, lots and lots
of money, and Kennedy is happily raising it. No qualms, no doubts,
no complaints about the dirty business of fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared to devote all my time, energy and assets, which
include the family name, toward retaking the House,'' Kennedy, the
youngest of three children of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said
last week, very much ``on message'' as he perched on the edge of a
chair in the Rayburn Room, just off the House floor. ``And I'm
absolutely convinced that I'm using my family name to its best ends
_ and that is to promote an agenda that my family fought for and
died for in service to this country. And I feel spiritual about it.
I really feel that I am a vehicle for my family's legacy of public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those beliefs, Kennedy said, the constant fund raising is
just ``part of the crusade, the mission.'' The ``attempt to curtail
corporate money and soft money is the noblest of causes,'' he said,
but he is playing by the current rules of the game. The Democratic
campaign committee raised $17 million in the first six months of
this year, $9 million of which was ``soft money,'' the unlimited
contributions that corporations, unions and individuals can give
for ``party building'' rather than money given in support of an
individual candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy invited some of the biggest contributors _ those who
gave $100,000 or more _ to a day-and-a-half retreat at the family's
compound at Hyannis Port, Mass., this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign finance, said,
``Whether it's Patrick Kennedy being able to pull this stuff out,
or business people acting in their own interests, it all adds up to
more money for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is the downside of being a Kennedy in politics? The
assumption that he would never be here without the name?
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy laughed. In fact, he said, it's easier to be a Kennedy
in politics than anywhere else. ``Hey, it's out on the table. I'm
here because of it. You know what? I get certain perks and
advantages because of it. And you know what? My responsibility is
to make the most of it, and that's what I hope to do. It gives me a
certain freedom. I get to josh with my colleagues about it. It's
the opener at all my events _ `I'm sure I'm in this position at the
ripe age of 32, and it had nothing to do with my last name.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he struggled to come to grips with the name as a
teenager, when he underwent treatment for substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I suffered from terrible anxiety and depression over
how to reconcile who I was to a very public family that I believed
had expectations for me, that I felt some personal obligation to
fulfill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had a lot of sorting out to do, on top of my adolescent
years, which invariably are just crazy years for any young person
anyway. I had a lot on my plate, and I got caught up in drugs and
alcohol _ it was an alternative to getting treatment _ and because
of my hitting a wall with that I was able to get treatment. And the
whole world of figuring out these issues and resolving these
dilemmas opened up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who is single, was 21 when he first ran for office,
ousting a longtime Democratic incumbent from the state Legislature
with the help of a big-spending campaign. He won his House seat in
1994, the Republican landslide year, while his father was
struggling for his political life in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many, Patrick Kennedy decided last year not
to run for the Senate, for the seat held by the retiring Sen. John
Chafee, a Republican, who has since died. Kennedy said he had no
regrets about the decision, although his father liked the idea of
serving together with him. As it is, Kennedy said, he has lunch
with his father once or twice a week, but ``the House is going to
be my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt appointed him to the position of campaign committee
chairman, and if the Democrats pick up the handful of seats
necessary to make a majority next year, Gephardt will be speaker
and Kennedy will have a very powerful mentor _ not to mention a
seat on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we retake the House and I retake my seat on the
Appropriations Committee, I'm going to be on track at a very young
age to gaining some real power on the most powerful committee of
the United States Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But first comes a year of political struggle. ``It's going to be
white hot,'' Kennedy said. ``I don't see a more contentious battle
politically, even in a presidential election year, than the battle
for control of the House.''

EDITORIAL: IMPEDING FAIR ACCESS TO ORGANS

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert have engineered another delay of important reforms to the
nation's system for distributing donated human organs for
transplants. The delay would prevent new regulations from going
into effect until next year, giving opponents of the reform more
opportunity to organize efforts that could postpone the new rules
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans attached their rider to a package containing two
bills, one that would allow disabled people to work without losing
Medicare benefits and another that would extend certain tax
credits. These are highly popular bills that President Clinton is
expected to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The rider would hurt patients who are in the greatest medical
need. About 62,000 Americans are now waiting to receive organ
transplants, and 4,000 die each year while waiting. For nearly five
years, the Clinton administration has been trying to improve the
current allocation system, which directs donated organs to patients
in the local area before they are offered regionally. This means
sicker patients often have to wait longer than healthier ones
simply because of where they live.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposed regulations would revamp the
system to allow broader organ sharing across wider regions and give
medical criteria more weight. The United Network for Organ Sharing,
a private organization that coordinates distribution nationally,
has fought the new regulations, even though the group would be
given authority to design the new allocation system. Many small
transplant centers have lobbied vigorously against any change,
fearing a reduction in their supply of locally donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress issued a one-year moratorium on the reforms.
The new rider would further delay them by 90 days. That means the
regulations would not go into effect until after Congress returned
from its holiday break, giving opponents a chance to extend the
effective date yet again. The two leaders realize that Congress
would be less likely to undo rules that were already in place when
it came back to work. For that reason, the administration had
agreed to a shorter delay that would push off the effective date to
early January, before Congress returns. That compromise is in the
omnibus budget bill. Unfortunately, under procedural rules, the
Lott-Hastert rider is expected to override that compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There has been lengthy public debate on this issue. The system
needs to be made more rational and less dependent on geography. The
longer Congress blocks reform, the greater the chance that lives
will be lost.

COMMENTARY: THE SOFTER SIDE OF STEINBRENNER

   NEW YORK _ Psst. The New York Yankees aren't going anywhere. Not
to New Jersey. Not to the West Side. A glittering new 21st-century
stadium will blossom in the Bronx, where the greatest tradition in
all of sports will continue. Bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner was sitting in the lounge of the Regency
Hotel, reflecting, reminiscing. At 69 he is the principal owner of
the undisputed best team in baseball, and he is not just loving it,
he seems to be cherishing it. His eyes are on his legacy. The man
who managed to get himself banned from baseball not once but twice,
who feuded with Yogi Berra and Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson and
anybody else who came into the neighborhood, is turning into a
class act, and an emotional one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have picked up on this. A few days after the Yankees won
the World Series, Steinbrenner dropped by the Post House, an East
Side steak house, for lunch. As he walked toward his table in the
back, the patrons began clapping and soon the restaurant was filled
with applause. The same thing happened a few days later at the 21
Club.
</P>
<P>
   A few things are at work here. First, Steinbrenner is better
behaved. It took a long time, but some projects are tougher than
others. Second, the current edition of the New York Yankees is more
than just a great team. In its character and personality, it's an
almost perfect reflection of the denizens of New York City in the
late '90s _ decent, ambitious, hard-working, diverse, resilient,
tough and collectively triumphant. More than is usual, New York
fans see themselves in these Yankees. When Joe Torre, that ultimate
father figure, went down with cancer, much of the city held its
breath, and more people than you might imagine prayed.
</P>
<P>
   By season's end, with a World Series sweep having silenced the
obnoxiously chanting, tomahawk-chopping Atlantans, the Yankees
players, the owner, the manager and an extraordinary number of fans
were weeping.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard there was no crying in baseball. One might have
thought that would be especially true of New York. One might have
been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who you are,'' said Steinbrenner, ``in this city
you've got to be a battler to get anywhere. And this team embodies
that. You have your manager finding out in spring training that he
has cancer. And we had Darryl Strawberry and his problems, and him
coming down with cancer. And during the year we had three of our
young players lose their fathers. But the team stayed focused. This
team had more heart than any team I've ever had. And I'll tell you,
I think this city is like that, which is why New York right now is
probably the hottest place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When Steinbrenner, a shipbuilder from Cleveland, took over the
Yankees in 1973 it was a raggedy outfit that hadn't won in ages. He
promised he would be a hands-off owner. ``What a lie that was,'' he
said. ``I come in one day and they're talking about how tough times
are and there are fresh flowers on every secretary's desk. Every
day they did that. I said, `How much does this cost?' It was
running us thousands. I said, `Cut it out!'''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. ``I got involved,'' he said. He talked about the
team losing Joe DiMaggio this year. He talked about his father, who
was a top student and champion athlete at MIT, and he spoke
movingly about Billy Martin, whom he hired and fired so often it
made New Yorkers dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Billy died he was still my friend and he was still on my
payroll. He was with me two days before he died. As a favor to me,
he read `The Night Before Christmas' at this big Christmas concert
I do for underprivileged children. We had dinner together. We were
very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was killed in a truck accident on an icy road in upstate
New York on Christmas Day, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Steinbrenner if he would assure New Yorkers that the
Yankees weren't going anywhere, that they would stay in the Bronx.
It was obvious what he wanted to say. But he said he's still
negotiating. Later, people very close to Steinbrenner said very
definitely that he would never take the team out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   No one would rule out a move to the West Side, but I am
convinced that it won't happen. The once and future home of the
Yankees is in the Bronx. Meanwhile New Yorkers have the great joy
of watching a team that is perhaps the greatest ever. It's George
Steinbrenner's gift to a city that has been very, very good to him.

DOLPHINS MANHANDLE BLEDSOE, BEAT PATRIOTS, 27-17 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Nobody had to alert the Miami Dolphins' defense Sunday
to the perils of facing a quarterback like the New England
Patriots' Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such a great arm and he's so big,'' Dolphins middle
linebacker Zach Thomas said. ``He just sits in there and he usually
hits teams big when you can't get any pressure. But when you get
pressure, it doesn't matter how good your quarterback is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins indeed mounted pressure Sunday. Thomas was speaking
after Miami's 27-17 victory over New England before 74,295 at Pro
Player Stadium, a game in which the Dolphin defense had five
interceptions. Miami moved to 8-2, while dropping New England to
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to him early and he started getting a little rattled,
started letting the ball fly,'' cornerback Sam Madison, who had one
of the interceptions, said of Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who was sacked four times, readily acknowledged his
part in the Patriots' downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball's in my hands, it's my responsibility to take
care of it, and when I turn it over five times, we got no chance,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the interceptions of Bledsoe came in the fourth quarter,
the first with Miami nursing a 24-17 lead. He threw in the flat
only to have the 6-foot-6-inch defensive end Jason Taylor in better
position to catch it than the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Miami possession at the Patriots' 21. Seven plays
later, with 3 minutes 11 seconds left in th Olindo Mare
kicked a 23-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots still had some faint hope, but that evaporated with
Jerry Wilson's interception with 1:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which gave Miami a sweep of the teams' two games
this season, left the Patriots with a two-game losing streak and
the Dolphins crowing about being able to overcome last week's 23-3
loss to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't continue to lose ground like this,'' Patriots coach
Pete Carroll said. ``This was an enormous opportunity for us to get
back in one game, but we didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said: ``In our division, you have
no room for error. I think our entire football team really laid it
on the line this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory could have been costly. Damon Huard, who has a 4-1
record as the starting quarterback since Dan Marino suffered a neck
injury, had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a
broken nose. Miami led at the time, 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by the journeyman Scott Zolak, who spent eight
seasons with the Patriots before being waived by the Jets this
season. Zolak took the collar as a passer, 0 for 4, but the
Dolphins relied primarily on the rookie running back J.J. Johnson,
who ran for 106 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's neck injury has healed enough so that he can resume
practice on Monday, and he has a chance of starting on Thanksgiving
Day at Dallas, Jimmy Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dan can't play and I have to play Thursday, I'll be fine,''
Huard said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, Huard did throw two touchdown passes, both to
wide receiver Oronde Gadsden.
</P>
<P>
   Miami fell behind early in the game when Terry Allen scored on a
6-yard run. A trade of field goals left the visitors ahead midway
through the second quarter. That's when Gadsden cashed in on his
first touchdown, a 4-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 10-10 in the third quarter, Gadsden
leaped high to seal a 3-yard touchdown catch, and Miami kept the
lead the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Johnson's 1-yard run expanded Miami's margin to 14 points,
but late in the third quarter, Bledsoe put a scare back in the
Dolphins with a 68-yard touchdown connection with wide receiver
Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe kept firing in the final quarter. He finished with 15
completions in 34 passes for 201 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Dolphins tied for first with Indianapolis
in the American Football Conference East, with Buffalo a game and a
half back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough division,'' Miami defensive end Trace
Armstrong said. ``I really think it's going to be won by the team
that's got the most mental toughness. We plan on being that team.''

COMMENTARY: A LIGHTWEIGHT HE'S NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The political news of the week is that George W.
Bush can comport himself confidently under sustained, serious
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to denigrate his first foreign policy speech. The
surprise in that committee product was the way he did not follow
his father and Bill Clinton into kowtowing to China's ruthless
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Though he left Wei Jingsheng off his honor roll of communism's
dissidents, Bush denounced China as ``alarming abroad and appalling
at home ... an espionage threat to our country ... an enemy of
religious freedom and a sponsor of forced abortion _ policies
without reason and without mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Free Chinese on Taiwan were heartened by his ``we deny the right
of Beijing to impose their ((sic)) rule on a free people'' and his
promise that admission of China to the World Trade Organization
``should open the door to Taiwan as well.'' Would Bush, as
president, flip-flop on China, as Clinton did at the behest of
Riady contributors? Nobody knows, but it was good to see Bush alert
to ``China's poor record in honoring agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The import of that speech was not so much in what he said but in
what he got into his head. Speech preparation is the best kind of
homework. In working on a largely thematic address with an
experienced team of realists and hard-liners, the Texas governor
prepared himself for the First Exam.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, he displayed both his new
familiarity and his old fuzziness on the third of the program
directed to foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Russert pressed him on his speech pledge to ``help Taiwan
defend itself.'' Did this mean we would consider an attack on
Taiwan an attack on the United States? Bush's answer was correct:
``We would consider it a need to enforce the Taiwan relations law''
_ which commits us to help Taiwan, but is deliberately ambiguous
about going to war.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if we would give Taiwan the weapons we are developing to
shoot down incoming missiles, Bush had a sophisticated reply:
``Whether we own it or Taiwan owns it, whether we own it or Japan
owns it, it's not a matter of ownership; it's a matter of
deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   China will take that to mean that the United States would
maintain control of anti-ballistic missiles to be installed in
Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and other threatened allies, or on
warships in the area, much as we did with our NATO nuclear weapons
on European soil.
</P>
<P>
   But asked to be consistent about applying economic penalties to
China as well as Russia after human rights abuses, Bush waffled.
His mind-set is not where his speech text is: ``We have got to work
with the Chinese,'' he replied. ``We need to be very harsh with
China, but I don't think we have the same amount of _ maybe we got
the same amount of export-import bank loans, I can't answer that
question in specific. ...''
</P>
<P>
   It did not trouble me that Bush flunked Russert's subtle test
about the number of missiles agreed to in START II, or that he
ducked a commitment when provided the answer in the follow-up: ``If
START II brings it down to 3,500,'' the host asked, ``would you be
willing to do down to 1,000 with START III?''
</P>
<P>
   Such figures are drilled into memory before a negotiation; a
better criterion in judging his capacity is his realism about the
next step: ``I want to work with the Russians to dismantle the
nuclear warheads and weaponry that's in place that already is a
part of the first START series.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a good foreign policy theme in nuclear ``safety,''
which he pushed without being asked. Republican candidates agree on
the need for deployment soon of a theater missile defense, followed
by a space-based national one, costly though it will be; Gore or
Bradley will be dragged along by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   And asked about the Clinton record with Russia, Bush was alert
enough to put a shot across Al Gore's bow: ``We'll find out more
about Viktor Chernomyrdin and the vice president ((Gore)) and the
relationship they have.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, a respectable performance. Anybody can read a speech;
few politicians can come out of a full hour in the ring with
Russert relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about his pronunciation of the word ``nuclear'' ...

NATION TO SEE USC VS. NORTH CAROLINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC will probably play bigger basketball games
this season, but none will receive the national exposure of
tonight's game against fifth-ranked North Carolina in the Maui
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be televised by ESPN and give the Trojans (1-0)
one of their largest audiences in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get better exposure than that,'' USC coach Henry
Bibby said. ``We're out there to get better as a team. Obviously
we'll see where the program is. But it will give us more recruiting
and national exposure for USC than in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have played marquee schools in recent years, with
games against Kansas the past two seasons, and North Carolina in
1996, but none of those contests were nationally televised.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably the biggest game from a national standpoint since
USC played ninth-ranked Cincinnati at the Sports Arena on Super
Bowl Sunday in 1997 on ABC. USC lost to the Bearcats 100-81.

 &HT;    Rudd's 16-year streak of at least 1 win ends
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Ricky Rudd got a top 10 finish in the No. 10 Ford
(he was seventh) in Sunday's Napa 500, but his streak of having won
at least one race a season ended after 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was more relieved than disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I'm just glad it's over with,'' Rudd
said.
</P>
<P>
   His next order of business is an auction in a couple of weeks to
sell the equipment for his race team, which lost its sponsorship.
His days as an owner-driver will end next season when he drives the
No. 28 Ford for Robert Yates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operating off three hours of sleep a night for the last couple
of months, trying to get our stuff together for the auction coming
up, I'm just glad it's over,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it would've ended on a winning note, but we went down
swinging. We tried hard, but just were unable to come up with a
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather cooperates
</P>
<P>
   Partly sunny skies, 70 degrees. Was this really Atlanta Motor
Speedway in November?
</P>
<P>
   Last year's race ended past midnight because of day-long rains.
The spring race at AMS has been plagued by cold and rain. But
Sunday was a Chamber of Commerce day, and the drivers appreciated
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to come here and have a nice day to race in,''
Rusty Wallace said. ``It's a great race track and a neat facility,
but it's just got terrible weather. It's got too late of a race and
too early of a race (March). This race probably needs to be a
couple of weeks before Homestead. Homestead, we're guaranteed good
weather so we love it. Everybody's wanting to have the last race
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was nice; it stayed pretty consistent all day long
and made for a good race and easy to adjust on the course,'' Steve
Park said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty neat racing in the sunshine here,'' Jeremy
Mayfield said. ``Jeff Burton and I were talking before the race
that it's been awhile since we didn't have rain here.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's last lap
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan was greeted with a standing ovation as he circled
the track on a farewell lap before the start of the race. It was a
final tribute to Irvan, who was forced to retire from Winston Cup
after suffering a career-ending wreck at Michigan last August.
</P>
<P>
   Decked out in the M&AMP;M's racing uniform, Irvan drove a Pontiac
Grand Prix show car around the track at about 50 mph. Irvan, who is
still recovering from a concussion, was accompanied in the car by
two racing officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie _ good job, you didn't wreck,'' joked Jay Frye, Irvan's
former team manager.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan was congratulated by other race teams as he parked on pit
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank all the race fans who have supported me
through the years,'' Irvan said. ``The sport has gotten so big, and
I was happy to be a part of it in the day and time I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farewell lap was real emotional for me. This was really
nice for Atlanta Motor Speedway to honor me with this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a gas
</P>
<P>
   Braves third-base coach Ned Yost enjoyed himself filling in as
second gas man for Dale Earnhardt and the Richard Childress Racing
Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are good friends of mine,'' said Yost, who worked
the last seven races of the 1994 season during the baseball strike
and got the call for the NAPA 500 when the regular crew member
couldn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Yost was also a second gas man for Neil Bonnett. Unlike his
baseball job, Yost doesn't have to wave the driver around or pass
along any signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just pick up the heavy gas can without dropping it and give
it to the first gas man,'' Yost said. ``It's an easy job.''
</P>
<P>
   No Waltrip retirement
</P>
<P>
   Travis Carter, co-owner of the No. 66 Ford, said on Sunday that
he is not taking seriously the comments Darrell Waltrip's made
about retiring immediately. Waltrip, who failed to qualify for
Sunday's race, told a TV station he may not return for season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been brought to my attention that (Waltrip) made the
statement, but it is not something that I'm (personally) aware of
and I don't know if it has been discussed internally,'' Carter
said. ``That might've just been a reaction out of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup champion, failed to make the
field five times in the final nine races. He announced in July that
next season will be his last. Kmart, the team's primary sponsor,
has already begun heavily promoting Waltrip's farewell season,
which is dubbed ``Victory Tour 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got plans for Darrell to be back,'' Carter said, ``so at
this point, that is what we expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's fan day
</P>
<P>
   The annual Bill Elliott Fan Appreciation Day is scheduled today
in Dawsonville, Ga. It takes place from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Bill
Elliott Racing in Dawsonville. The event is open to Fan Club
members only, and as many as 10,000 people have showed up in recent
years. Elliott will sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't call it an `open house,' '' said Dixie Price,
president of the Bill Elliott Fan Club. ``The last time that
happened, about 65,000 people over-ran Dawsonville.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte chief change
</P>
<P>
   Gary DeHart is expected to be hired as the crew chief for Terry
Labonte next season. He will replace Andy Graves, who is expected
to leave Hendrick Motorsports within the next month. The personnel
move would be a reunion for Labonte and DeHart, who teamed to win
the 1996 Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte finished out of the top 10 in Winston Cup points for the
fifth time in his 22-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Moment to forget
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Spencer started his 300th Winston Cup race on Sunday, but
it won't be fond memory. Spencer blew a right tire on lap 80 and
collided into the outside retainer wall. The No. 23 Ford, which
briefly caught on fire, did not return to the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for my crew and I feel bad for myself,'' Spencer
said. ``We had a way we (wanted) to close it out 1999. It was my
300th start and it would've been a fitting end to our relationship
with (sponsor) R.J. Reynolds and Winston. But it wasn't meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer will remain with the No. 23 team next year, but has yet
to find a new primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader, who finished 19th, made his final appearance on
Sunday with U.S. Tobacco Company, which ended a 19-year
relationship as a team sponsor in Winston Cup. In honor of the
Skoal Racing team, each driver signed the hood of the No. 33 Chevy
before the race.
</P>
<P>
   M. Waltrip hospitalized
</P>
<P>
   Michael Waltrip suffered a slight concussion in a four-car wreck
at turn four on lap 199. Rescue workers had to cut the roof off the
No. 7 Chevrolet to remove Waltrip, who was conscious. He was
released Sunday night from Atlanta Medical Center.

 &HT;    Labonte lams AMS laps
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Bobby Labonte's victory in Sunday's NAPA 500 was
not surprising to many Ford and Chevrolet drivers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Labonte was driving a Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   For the third Winston Cup race in a row, a Pontiac was parked in
victory lane. Labonte won at Atlanta Motor Speedway, breaking a
two-race winning streak by his Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, Tony
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's No. 18 Pontiac dominated the race, leading 147 of 325
laps and crossing the finish line by 2.43 seconds in front of
runner-up Dale Jarrett, the 1999 Winston Cup champion. It was a
sensational accomplishment, considering Labonte performed poorly in
qualifying and was forced to take a provisional to start all the
way back at 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, it was a great weekend for us, (but) it didn't
start out like we planned, that's for sure,'' Labonte said. ``We
had a great race car from beginning; we just started 37th. We just
couldn't get hold of (the car) in qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac posted nine victories this season after a winning a
total of six in the four previous seasons. Pontiac drivers won two
pole positions and three victories in the final three races.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chevrolet drivers have complained that Pontiacs have an
unfair advantage with their rear spoiler-configuration. The whining
reached an all-time high when Pontiac drivers swept the top five
qualifying positions last week at Homestead, Fla..
</P>
<P>
   Only three Pontiacs started in the top 10 on Sunday. The other
manufacturers viewed the qualifying results with skepticism since
NASCAR said Pontiacs will likely undergo changes for the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't I tell you Friday that this was going to be another
Pontiac show, just like the two previous races,'' said Jimmy
Fennig, crew chief for Ford No. 6 driver Mark Martin. ``They've got
the real package; that's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   Said No. 1 Chevrolet driver Steve Park: ``NASCAR might need to
look at the rules to kind of even things up. (With Labonte)
starting last, coming back up and winning the race, I think the
Pontiacs were sandbagging a little bit this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who finished second in the Winston Cup points standings
behind Jarrett, was offended by the accusations of a Pontiac
conspiracy in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody here that thinks I want to
qualify bad, because my record all year has really been good in
qualifying up until Friday night,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sandbagging, (and) I've never sandbagged in my life.
(NASCAR) slapped my hand at Pocono (last July) for winning by nine
seconds. I'll slap their hands if they say that. (NASCAR) screamed
at me before to slow down because I was running away with it. I
can't explain. I've never sandbagged in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was the only Pontiac driver to finish in the top 10 on
Sunday. Ford No. 12 driver Jeremey Mayfield lost a duel with
Jarrett in the final 12 laps to place third.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent Pontiac controversy, Labonte has a history of
success at Atlanta. He has won four of the last seven Winston Cup
races at the 1.54-mile quad-oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed the character of this team,'' said Jimmy Maker,
the No. 18 crew chief. ``You never give up. You don't ever give up.
The championship was out of our reach coming into Atlanta, and we
had only one thing that could make it a good weekend here -- try to
win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning his fifth race of the season, Labonte held off Mark
Martin for second place in the final points standings. Stewart is
fourth, while Jeff Burton edged out Jeff Gordon for the final spot
in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the winner of the last two events at Atlanta, trailed
Burton by two points entering Sunday's season-ender. Gordon blew
his chances of finishing in the top five when he blew his engine on
lap 181.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah, I'm glad to end up fifth in the standings, but I
would have rather raced (Gordon) for it,'' Burton said. ``I hate
that he had mechanical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who was fifth on Sunday, is the only other driver than
Labonte to win a race from a provisional starting spot. Burton
started 38th and won at New Hampshire.

ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE RULES FOR PROTECTING WORKERS FROM RSI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 13th graf for correction saying rules would cost employers
$3.5 billion, not million.) (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is about to propose new
workplace rules that officials said would protect millions of
workers from repetitive-stress injuries, one of the major sources
of physical pain and disability in offices and factories across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the rules would require employers to adopt
full-scale ergonomics programs to minimize workplace hazards if
even a few employees have suffered such injuries. Officials at the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said they planned to
issue the regulations this month.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has been delayed for years as business groups
argued that the standards were unnecessary and too expensive.
Opponents in the House of Representatives tried this year to delay
the rules for further review, and some agencies within the
administration have also voiced doubts. But the White House has
decided to act now, as Congress has left town.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 3, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would
prevent the Labor Department from issuing any new ergonomic
standards until that study was finished. But the Senate has not
approved the legislation, so the Labor Department is free to issue
its rules. The rules will be made final only after a period of
public comment, but federal officials say the comments will not
derail the plan.
</P>
<P>
   One critic, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said the standards
would be ``the most far-reaching regulation ever issued by OSHA.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would try to reduce the burden of
the rules on small businesses. But business groups and their allies
in Congress still vehemently oppose the rules, saying the costs
will far exceed the benefits for most employers.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft of the new rules, OSHA, the federal agency that
regulates workplace safety, insisted that ``ergonomics programs are
cost-effective and feasible'' because they can reduce specific
types of workplace injuries known as musculoskeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   These disorders include strains and sprains, lower back pain,
carpal tunnel syndrome, hernias and other ailments caused by
repetitive motion, overexertion, bending, climbing or crawling.
They cut across blue-collar and white-collar jobs and account for
more than one-third of all serious occupational injuries and
illnesses in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While more research is always welcome, OSHA says, hundreds of
scientific studies in recent years have produced ``overwhelming
evidence'' that these injuries are linked to workplace activities.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA says that more than 600,000 Americans suffer work-related
musculoskeletal disorders each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under ergonomics programs, employers must systematically analyze
the risks of various jobs, change work practices to minimize or
eliminate hazards and provide treatment to employees for
work-related medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial estimate of the benefits and costs of the new
rules, OSHA says employers would have to fix or redesign 4.5
million jobs in the first year, ``and a diminishing number
thereafter.'' These changes, it says, would prevent 32,000 to
95,000 injuries each year.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA, a unit of the Labor Department, said its rules would cost
employers $3.5 billion in the first year. One-fourth of the cost
stems from one of the most hotly debated provisions: a requirement
that employers provide full pay and benefits to workers who are
removed from their jobs or reassigned to less strenuous tasks
because of their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Employers would have to maintain such pay and benefits up to six
months. The Clinton administration says this protection is
essential to encourage workers to report their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret M. Seminario, director of occupational safety and
health for the AFL-CIO, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this rule is to catch injuries early, before
they become severe and disabling,'' Ms. Seminario said. ``Workers
won't come forward if they believe they'll lose their jobs or have
their pay reduced. These injuries occur gradually over time. When
they progress to the point of significant disability, they cause
extensive time off the job and are among the most costly of all
workplace injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration, an independent government
agency that analyzes the impact of federal rules on small
businesses, said OSHA had grossly underestimated the cost of its
rules and probably overstated the benefits. The annual cost to
employers could easily exceed $18 billion, the business agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the business agency said that the
guarantee of pay and benefits for injured workers could
significantly increase the number of claims filed for workplace
injuries. ``If this potential is realized,'' it said, ``employees
will benefit from reduced injuries and illnesses, but employers
will experience a net increase in workers' compensation premiums
and related costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fluharty, a spokesman for OSHA, said, ``We expect to
publish the rules as a formal proposal by the end of November.''
The public, he said, will have several months to comment before the
agency issues final rules with the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have been under review at the White House Office of
Management and Budget since July 2. Congressional aides said they
understood that the budget office had questioned some of OSHA's
cost estimates and had suggested changes in the rules to reduce the
costs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under one proposal intended to lighten the burden on small
businesses, an employer could avoid the need for a full-scale
ergonomics program if it quickly corrected a specific problem after
one worker was hurt in an isolated incident. If, for example, a
worker was injured lifting heavy boxes, the employer might be
allowed to make a ``quick fix'' by purchasing a mechanical hoist to
lift the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Congress, the National Academy of Sciences is
investigating whether particular work activities cause
musculoskeletal disorders. The academy said its study would be
completed in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said, ``There is insufficient scientific evidence to
justify a costly new ergonomics regulation.'' Food Distributors
International, a trade association of food wholesalers, said the
rules would require its members to rebuild or reconfigure
warehouses, at a cost of $5 billion, and could force some of them
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we wait for the National Academy of Sciences to
complete its study?'' asked John R. Block, president of Food
Distributors International. ``Why the rush? The administration
wants to finish this regulation before George W. Bush is elected.
Vice President Gore owes a lot to labor unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials denied that they were motivated by politics.
They said they had been concerned about ergonomic issues for more
than a decade. As secretary of labor in 1990, they noted, Elizabeth
H. Dole started to develop ergonomic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Jeffress, the assistant secretary of labor in charge
of OSHA, said scientists had found compelling evidence that
repetitive motions could cause carpal tunnel syndrome, just as
heavy lifting could cause back injuries. Jeffress said employers
were hypocritical in trying to delay and discredit the new
standards, because they knew that ergonomic programs could prevent
injuries, cut costs and improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting with employers, Jeffress said: ``You cry
wolf about ergonomics, while at the same time investing in
ergonomic programs to protect your employees. Have you no shame? Do
you not care about the reputation for misrepresentation that you
are creating for your corporations?''

 &HT;    Last-minute collapse: Atlanta drops to Tampa Bay 19-10
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY _ Long after Sunday's game was over, Winslow Oliver
sat at his locker under Raymond James Stadium with his head buried
in a towel.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, a reserve running back, felt like his Falcons team
should have won. He also felt responsible for the 19-10 loss to a
Tampa Bay team that didn't score an offensive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa (6-4) got its touchdown on defense, when a ball ricocheted
off Oliver's hands to Bucs cornerback Donnie Abraham, who returned
it 47 yards for a touchdown with 27 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse,'' Oliver said. ``It was a catchable ball. I
don't know if I was trying to run (too early) to get the first down
before I even got the ball. Sometimes it comes down to one or two
plays, and we can't seem to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Gramatica, a rookie, was the hero for Tampa Bay. He hit
four field goals, including a 53-yarder with 58 seconds left for a
12-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That came after the Falcons (2-8) passed up a chance at a
54-yard field goal attempt in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But this loss wasn't about second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   It was about failed execution, on third down, where the Falcons
converted their first five on the way to a 10-0 lead and an 89-0
rushing advantage in the first quarter. But that was it for the
offense; Tampa outgained Atlanta 239-80 after that. Unable to
handle the Buccaneers blitz, Atlanta failed on its final nine third
downs.
</P>
<P>
   The end came when Oliver mishandled the pass, setting off a wild
celebration from the Bucs and their 65,158 fans.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, the Falcons were guaranteed yet again of never
having back-to-back winning seasons -- in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   For the seventh time in 10 games, the Falcons managed just one
touchdown, an 8-yard run by wide receiver Tim Dwight that was set
up by Eugene Robinson's interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had a meager 92 passing yards, and wide receiver
Terance Mathis was held to one catch for 6 yards. The defense gave
up 239 yards, and allowed the Bucs to convert only 5-of-16 third
downs. But they were big conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa's first field goal came in the second quarter, when facing
third-and-9 from their 13, Jacquez Green caught a 47-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bucs' next possession, Tampa quarterback Trent Dilfer
passed for one first down on third-and-5, sneaked for 1 yard on
fourth-and-1 and scrambled for 19 yards on third-and-13.
</P>
<P>
   That drive reached the Atlanta 8 and ended with Gramatica's
26-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The first key play in the fourth quarter was another
interception by Abraham, on third-and-4 at the Falcons' 41, on one
of the few plays the Bucs tried to cover Mathis one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   That interception set up a 50-yard field goal by Gramatica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big plays,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``We constantly
are not making them, and the other team is.''

 &HT;    Glimpse of Gretzky worth trip to Hall
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Not even Santa Claus can upstage Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   As Toronto staged its annual Christmas Parade Sunday, fans of
all ages ignored Santa for a chance to get a glimpse of the Great
One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Dad, it's Wayne,'' yelled Matthew Campagna, 5, of
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gretzky was on a television monitor, answering
questions from about 150 randomly selected fans who crammed into
the Hockey Hall of Fame the day before induction ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always hope you might get lucky and be one of those
picked,'' said Matthew's father, Claudio. ``This happens only one
time and there is only one Wayne Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who retired seven months ago with 61 NHL records, will
be inducted tonight along with former referees Andy van Hellemond
and Scotty Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   A player is supposed to have to wait three years after
retirement. But officials didn't hesitate to make an exception for
Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame has been packed since it opened its mammoth
``Wayne Gretzky: The Legend'' exhibit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It covers 2,300-square feet and includes everything from
Gretzky's first skates _ worn when he was 2 years old _ to the net
that caught his record-setting 802nd goal. There is even an old No.
9 Atlanta Knights jersey worn by Gretzky's youngest brother, Brent.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky received a standing ovation Saturday night before the
first Hall of Fame Game, which matched his old New York Rangers
against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The induction ceremony will be
carried live across Canada, as well as on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bobinski, who was wearing an Edmonton jersey and No. 99
hat, got up at 5 a.m. Sunday in hopes of being picked for the fans'
forum with Gretzky. He wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he still loves Wayne,'' said his girlfriend, Linda
Belanger.
</P>
<P>
   Fans got to ask Gretzky questions for more than a half hour and
took pictures of him in front of the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   A question from a young girl generated the most laughs: ``Is
there any record you don't hold?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replied Gretzky, breaking into a broad smile.
``Penalties.''

<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ When a group of newly freed slaves here
wanted to form a community of their own just after the Civil War,
they had to take whatever land they could get. In 1865, that was a
snake-infested, mosquito-ridden swamp in a flood plain along the
southern side of the Tar River in eastern North Carolina. It was
land that the white people in nearby Tarboro, on the northern side
of the river, did not want.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, those former slaves had built a town so
viable that they petitioned the state to recognize it as a legal
entity. In 1865, Princeville became the first town in the United
States to be chartered and governed solely by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now the more than 2,000 residents of Princeville, many of whom
are direct descendants of its founders, are struggling with a
dilemma more extreme than any other this town has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   Their storied community was washed away in September by the
worst flooding in North Carolina's history. Now they must choose
whether to return to the now uninhabited land and rebuild, or
abandon forever the place where their ancestors first experienced
full U.S. citizenship. The impending decision has those who would
accept a federal buyout of the town at odds with the many who
believe that doing so would betray the cherished legacy of their
forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge we are facing in Princeville,'' said Rep. Eva
Clayton, the Democrat whose district includes the town, ``is how to
keep its legacy and make it viable in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of places similarly devastated by floods in recent
years have accepted government buyouts of all or part of their
towns. Grand Forks, N.D., was one, along with Valmeyer, Ill., and
Kinston, N.C. Federal Emergency Management Agency officials have
already received word from at least 45 city or county governments
affected by the floods in eastern North Carolina that they intend
to apply for federal buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   In all, officials estimate, the flooding caused $1.2 billion
worth of structural damage across the state. Of the 6,000 buildings
that the federal agency estimates were damaged beyond repair
statewide, about 600 are in Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Princeville officials reported that only 92 people
had signed up for the buyout so far. &UR;  &LR; The town has given its
residents, about 40 of whom are white, a Dec. 16 deadline to submit
applications. After that, city leaders will decide whether there is
enough interest to apply for the buyout. The town government must
make a formal application before any individual applications are
considered. If the town decides against a buyout, no residents will
be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   For Glennie Matthewson 2nd, 55, a lawyer and former Princeville
mayor, leaving is not an option. His great-grandmother was a slave
and one of the first residents of Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our ancestors built this town they were seen as uppity
blacks, with the audacity to talk about incorporating their own
town,'' Matthewson said. ``That is a hell of a legacy. The deeper
the roots the harder the fight, and the more resistance you're
going to get to taking the town from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Princeville, Delia Perkins, 57, lost her home in
the flood, but she too remains firm about returning. She works full
time as a teacher's assistant in the Edgecombe County School system
and receives $250 a month to serve as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers,'' she said, ``I would have said from Day
1 that we will rebuild, no doubt about it.'' But she added that she
believes the town government must consider all its options.
</P>
<P>
   Some question the wisdom of rebuilding. Marcia Wheeler, 43, a
mother of two, says she has no plans to return _ ever. ``I wouldn't
want to go through this again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the buyout, the Federal Emergency Management Agency would
purchase property for what appraisers estimate was the market value
the day before the flood. The buildings would be removed and the
open space deeded back to the town, but it could never be built on
again.
</P>
<P>
   If the town decides to rebuild, money from a federal buyout will
not be available and the town will seek money from other government
agencies and private sources. The mayor estimates the cost of
rebuilding to be at least $80 million. Central to the effort would
be reconstruction of a dike that controls the Tar River. That cost
is estimated at $300,000 and would be paid for by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The levee was built in 1965, a century after the settlement of
the area. It was designed to protect the town against the kind of
flood estimated to happen only every 300 years. That levy afforded
enough protection to negate the flood-plain status of the town in
official terms. And it is what allows the town to even consider the
option of returning to the same site.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Davison, mitigation director of the emergency management
agency, said the U.S. Geological Survey issued a report this month
saying the recent flood was well in excess of a 500-year event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a biblical kind of flood,'' Davison said. ``The risk
is so remote that we don't regulate against it, just as we don't
protect against meteors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Tar River began its rampage on Sept. 16, as the result of
the 20 inches of rain dumped on the state by Hurricane Floyd. On
the day it spilled over the dike, it had reached 48.5 feet above
sea level. Early the next morning the town was evacuated. The river
crested at 53 feet above sea level, and the town remained under
about 14 feet of water for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When residents were allowed to return, they were shocked to see
houses that had floated off their foundations and landed on top of
cars. Precious family photographs, keepsakes and heirlooms were
lost. Many houses had been condemned. More than 200 coffins
dislodged from the town cemetery were found floating around the
town. None of the original slaves' graves were disturbed _ perhaps
because they had been dug deeper than more recent graves.
</P>
<P>
   And even today, two months after the deluge, the damage is
strikingly evident in the deserted town. Mud-caked clothes hang
from trees. The water has gone and most of the facades of houses
are still intact, but their insides have been stripped bare to
remove destroyed furniture and rotted drywall.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case at Linda Whitest's home on Walston Street in
the heart of Princeville. Her one-year-old house was destroyed by
flood waters. Across the street, her grandmother's house, where Ms.
Whitest, 49, grew up, was destroyed. Next door to her grandmother's
house, her mother's house was also ruined. The homes are all
situated on land handed down from Ms. Whitest's great-grandfather,
Frank Walston, a son of slaves and the man for whom the street was
named.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago I said there is no way I'm going back, I was so
devastated,'' Ms. Whitest said. ``But then I thought about it, and
I said, why should I give up what my ancestors had worked so hard
to leave us? It would be like Princeville never existed, like it
had just been erased away.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthewson said moving the town even a few blocks away is
unacceptable to most residents. ``My ancestors' energies and
efforts and resources went into that specific property in
Princeville,'' he said. ``Those are the streets I played in, the
trees I climbed. You take the town and move it anywhere else, then
you've severed me from my actual roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the flooding, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al
Sharpton both visited the town, as did President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was Valley Forge,'' Sharpton said, ``imagine what
America would be doing. We preach black pride. Here's an example of
a city that has faced a major disaster. I think it's incumbent upon
black America to use its economic and political resources to try to
restore that city.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with other flood victims, the displaced residents of
Princeville are living either with friends or family or in the
temporary trailer park set up by the emergency management agency in
nearby Rocky Mount. The trailer park, just around the corner from a
women's prison, is officially named New Life Fountain Park.
Residents call it FEMA City.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Black, 35, a construction worker, has been living at the
temporary site since it was opened about seven weeks ago. He said
he plans to return to the Princeville property passed down to him
by his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people took that swampland and made a town out of it,''
Black said. ``It would make us look real bad to let it go now.''

VARGAS TURNS SPIN DOCTOR TO MEND IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A casual sports fan was asked whether she had heard of Fernando
Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighter out of Oxnard?'' she was reminded. No reaction
from her. ``IBF junior middleweight champion?'' No reaction. ``One
of the sport's rising stars?'' No reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighter accused with four friends of beating a man in a
suburban Santa Barbara home in July?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, THAT'S Fernando Vargas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such is Vargas' image as he awaits his fate in the pending case
_ he could face jail time _ and prepares to defend his title
against Ronald ``Winky'' Wright on Dec. 4 in Lincoln City, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   That he's known as much for the alleged beating incident as his
accomplishments in the ring disturbs Vargas, but he provides a
positive spin as he tries to move on with his life and career,
which could include a big-money bout with Ike Quartey in April.
</P>
<P>
   He's confident he will be vindicated when the truth comes out
and expressed frustration that ``I'm guilty until proven
innocent.'' At the same time, he admits he made a mistake and
learned a valuable lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I maintain full innocence and, hopefully, everything will be
cleared up,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I blame myself and no one else for putting myself in that
position,'' he added, referring to the fact he unwisely went alone
to the home of a casual female friend.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas and four friends are charged with beating Santa Barbara
resident Doug Rossi there. However, Vargas' attorneys insist that
witnesses cannot place Vargas in the room at the time of the
alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas also claims that HE was beaten up by Rossi and another
Santa Barbara resident, Anthony Arria, who apparently was the
former boyfriend of the woman Vargas went to visit.
</P>
<P>
   After he was beaten, Vargas said, he called his friends simply
to retrieve him and not to exact revenge, as some have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called them and said, `Get me outta here,''' said Vargas,
whose friends had his car. ``(The woman) called a taxi. I was gonna
take whichever got there first.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, was the extent of his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the full story comes out, you'll see that I did nothing
wrong,'' he said. ``I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, if
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I put myself in that position. Now, I'm more careful. I'm
more careful about where I go alone, what time I stay out 'til, who
I'm out with if I'm out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I have to be more careful. I can't get into any
type of problems anymore. I have too much to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Those he DOES go out with are a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe some of his friends from his rough Oxnard
neighborhood are bad influences, that they lead him to trouble.
Vargas, fiercely loyal to those who are good to him, bristles at
such a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends who were there have no type of records
whatsoever,'' he said. ``The most is a traffic ticket. I hate to
say it, but if this happened to four white guys, no one would
probably mention their friends. Obviously, because they're Latino,
Mexican, this happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that concern, but the bottom line was my friends
were there to aid me. They're my friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have friends who have been in trouble. But you know what?
I know who to associate with and who not to. I give them a
high-five, say `What's up, bro?' and I'm out.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Vargas has been lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers will be surprised if he spends time in prison,
particularly because he has no record. He managed to maintain his
corporate sponsorships, including Miller beer. And, as he said,
he's intelligent enough to use this experience to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a young person who makes mistakes,'' he said, ``but I'm
also a smart person who LEARNS from his mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!De La Hoya watch:!off! Oscar De La Hoya, who couldn't
make a deal to fight Felix Trinidad again, probably will face
Derell Coley for the WBC welterweight title in February or March if
Trinidad is stripped of the belt.
</P>
<P>
   If somehow Trinidad retains the 147-pound championship, which is
unlikely because he has moved up to 154 to fight David Reid, De La
Hoya could face WBO champ Ahmed Kotiev of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, De La Hoya will fight either on Feb. 26 at Madison
Square Garden in New York or on March 11 at Staples Center, said
Bob Arum, his promoter.
</P>
<P>
   If Arum can reach an agreement with Staples, he should have De
La Hoya fight there. The only intrigue with either matchup would be
if De La Hoya were to fight for a title in front of his hometown
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there might be more intrigue around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   If De La Hoya wins his next bout, he would then fight Shane
Mosley of Pomona on June 17, possibly at Staples, according to
Arum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Staples Center has that date open and they really
want the fight. It's a great story, two L.A. fighters,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``... It would be huge, huge, huge in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly would be interesting and a way for De La Hoya to
reclaim some of the credibility he lost against Trinidad. However,
he needs to get Trinidad back into the ring to make full amends.
Unfortunately, it might be a while before it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the biggest obstacle that scuttled negotiations for
the rematch was weight. Trinidad, who has had difficulty making 147
pounds, insisted the fight be at 154 while De La Hoya said he's not
ready to move up from 147.
</P>
<P>
   Arum was asked whether that was the deal breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, no question about that,'' he said. ``... Oscar makes 147
easily and he walks around less than (the 154) limit. He's not
going to fight anyone serious at fifty-four for at least another
year.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Forum Boxing:!off! Forum Boxing lives, only in a
different form.
</P>
<P>
   John Jackson, longtime head of Forum Boxing, and KCAL will team
with Arum to stage occasional shows in California and Nevada, Arum
said. Arum said he also will help promote the Forum's stable of
fighters. He added that he will soon announce plans to expand the
number of Latino-oriented shows he will promote.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Rabbit punches:!off! The 850,000 pay-per-view buy rate
for the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield fight on Nov. 13 doesn't
bode well for boxing considering the undisputed heavyweight title
was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   That figure pales next to the 1.2 million the fighters drew in
March.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 850,000 isn't a disaster and proves that
boxing has a committed core of fans. If they'll buy that fight
after the first controversial meeting, they'll buy anything....
</P>
<P>
   Lewis says he wants to fight Mike Tyson, which is wise for more
than just monetary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over the former champion would boost his image after
his so-so performance against Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   However, it might be a while before Tyson accepts such a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to fight Jan. 15 in either Great Britain or
Germany against what likely will be a hand-picked, non-threatening
opponent. A possibility is British Commonwealth champ Julius
Francis of England, who is 35.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, so inactive over the past few years, will need time to
prepare for the Lewises of the world.... Michael Grant showed some
heart in his 10th-round victory over Andrew Goltoa on Saturday. By
all accounts, he also showed that he's still developing and very
beatable.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a heavyweight out there destined to control the
division, it's unclear who he is....
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited bout between popular and entertaining Mexicans
Erik Morales and Marco Antonio Barrera is set for Feb. 19 in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It might be an exciting fight _ but not for long. Morales, the
WBC junior featherweight champ, is a step above Barrera and should
prove it quickly. &QL;

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Many of the items on the block were ordinary enough:
a plastic laundry hamper, card tables, camping gear, clothes,
tools, cookbooks, a sewing machine. Only a few _ a voluminous
collection of books about UFOs, 20 metal-frame bunk beds, a pair of
black Nike sneakers _ offered a hint of their macabre origins.
</P>
<P>
   The items auctioned by county officials Saturday were the last
earthly possessions of the 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult who
killed themselves nearly three years ago in hopes of boarding a
spaceship that they believed was trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. It
was one of the largest mass suicides in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The belongings on sale offered no insight on what had led their
former owners to believe that the path to the heavens began with a
lethal mix of barbiturates, vodka and apple sauce. There were 183
lots, which included television sets, videocassette recorders, a
camcorder and three cars.
</P>
<P>
   About 375 people came to bid with a mix of gallows humor,
indifference and ignorance. Their reasons for bidding ranged from
basic need to morbid curiosity to commercial intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go; this is not for me,'' said David Sauceda, a
40-year-old construction worker who was looking for tools when he
was told the source of the items.
</P>
<P>
   The curators of the Museum of Death, which is expected to open
in Hollywood in January, bought a bunk-bed frame to be used in a
display about cult deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Powell, 34, and his wife, Laura, 29, bought seven bunk beds
that they said they intended to sell on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might go for a couple grand each,'' Powell said. ``You
don't know. There are some weird people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the cult members were discovered on March 26,
1997, in a seven-bedroom house in an affluent suburb, after the
cult's leader, Marshall Herff Applewhite, had sent several people a
videotape in which he said the members would be ``shedding their
containers'' and ``leaving this planet.'' A videotape of the scene
made by investigators from the Sheriff's Department showed the cult
members uniformly dressed in black track suits and black Nike
sneakers, covered with purple shrouds.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was delayed by a probate battle involving two former
members of the group, Mark and Sarah King, who wanted control of
the estate. Though they ultimately lost, the county agreed to sell
them the ``intellectual property'' in the estate _ manuscripts,
artwork, computers and the like, as well as patches bearing the
cult's logo _ for $2,000. Kent W. Schirmer, the chief of San Diego
County's property division, said the Kings wanted to keep the
materials out of the public realm.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the auction will be given to families of the dead
to cover the cost of burial. Schirmer said the crowd was not much
larger than it is for most such auctions and the bidding amounts
were average. By the end of the day the items had fetched nearly
$33,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bidding was heaviest on the books and on the bunk-bed frames,
which generally sold for $110 to $130.
</P>
<P>
   Few in the crowd shared the cult's beliefs or acknowledged a
fascination with death. A man and woman dressed completely in black
and gray determinedly bid several hundred dollars for most, if not
all, of the books in the estate, but refused to speak with
reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Stangeland, a collectibles trader who holds a certificate
in mortuary science, said she bought one of the bed frames because
she was fascinated by cults and the power their leaders exert over
members. But she added: ``I don't want to sound morbid because I'm
really not. If God would alter the universe so people could live
forever, I'd be kicking my heels up.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward C. Songer, 66, a federal telecommunications worker, said
he bid on boxes of crimping tools, wires and phone cards because he
was able to pay $60 for items that would normally cost about $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just for my occupation, it's for my life,'' Songer said.
``It doesn't bother me where they came from.''
</P>
<P>
   But some voiced discomfort with the origin of the items.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Benavides, 25, said he wanted to buy a VCR because his had
broken down, and maybe a piece of memorabilia as well. But his
wife, Jennifer, 21, said she was unsure if she would allow
something like that in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Most people said they bid in the hopes of owning a novel, if
grim, piece of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd piece of San Diego history, but it happened here
nonetheless,'' said Andrew Shaw, a 27-year-old college student who
also bought a bed frame. He said he would put it in his guest
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   But would he sleep on it? ``Absolutely not,'' he said.

   A caravan of buses carrying hundreds of students back to
Pennsylvania State University after a day in Manhattan collided in
a chain-reaction pileup on a foggy Interstate highway in
northeastern Pennsylvania early Sunday. Two people died and 106
were injured, seven seriously, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the pileup minutes after midnight could not be
immediately determined. But the state police said the crash
occurred in heavy fog on westbound Interstate 80, near White Haven,
Pa., a largely rural stretch south of Wilkes-Barre, about two hours
from the main campus of Penn State at University Park.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses say the first bus may have hit a freeway overpass,
prompting a chain reaction. There were no immediate indications
Sunday of excessive speed or driver impairment, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of six buses carrying 280 passengers, nearly all Penn State
students but also a few parents, were involved in the accident. A
pickup truck and two automobiles were forced off the road by the
pileup, but it was not immediately clear whether passengers from
those vehicles were among the injured.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the second bus in the collision, Robert C. Burge,
50, of Altoona, Pa., was pronounced dead at the scene. Burge, a
former pastor of the Riggles Gap Bible Church in Altoona, Pa., was
an employee of the Blue and White Bus Line in Altoona, which
operated all six buses.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ice, the pastor of the Riggles Gap church, said Burge
had left a year ago after serving the congregation of 200 for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was driving buses to get by,'' Ice said. ``He just felt God
was calling him to a different ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   The other fatality was a Penn State student in the front row of
the third bus, who was also pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Denise R. Orndorff, a 23-year-old biology major
from Ohiopyle, Pa., was with her mother, Linda, who was listed in
satisfactory condition at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce A. Nalesnik, the Carbon County coroner, said autopsies
were scheduled for Ms. Orndorff and Burge.
</P>
<P>
   The injured suffered mainly minor cuts and bruises, and 99 were
treated and released, but six passengers and a bus driver remain
hospitalized, five of them in critical condition, Penn State's
president, Graham Spanier, said at a news conference Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Laura A. Snee, 20, a Penn State junior majoring in American
Studies who was in the bus where the driver died, said she was
asleep when it collided with the first bus, which had stopped or
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the bus in front of us and I got thrown into the seat
in front of me,'' said Ms. Snee, who had sat in the right window
seat in the second row. ``I was just coming to when I heard a woman
say something like, `Oh my gosh,' then two seconds later, the other
bus hit us from behind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Snee was pitched forward into the aisle in the front of the
bus, next to Burge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken out of the bus,'' Ms. Snee said. ``Everything
happened so fast and I had just been asleep. But I saw his face
covered later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee suffered a broken nose and cuts and bruises and was
back at her apartment on campus by Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two buses in the six-bus caravan were not involved
in the accident, and uninjured Penn State students rushed to help,
piling their coats in mounds so the injured could be covered,
providing cell phones so students could call home and applying
makeshift bandages to the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the fog began thickening in New Jersey shortly
after the caravan left Manhattan at about 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee said that while she was waiting in the emergency ward
of the Poconos Medical Center she compared notes with other
students, who said that the buses had slowed because of the fog,
putting them at least a half hour behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The buses were traveling at up to 40 mph, Ms. Snee said. A
student in the third bus in the collision, the one that hit Ms.
Snee's bus, told her that he had been looking through the
windshield and that all he saw was white fog lit up by the
headlights, then a sudden clearing of fog, followed by the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The students were part of a shopping and sightseeing outing
called ``Spend a Day in New York'' that cost $20 and left campus at
4:30 a.m. on Saturday. The 240-mile trip typically takes
four-and-half hours one way, but the caravan arrived in New York
about an hour late because one of the buses had a flat tire. The
students arrived around 10 a.m. and got off near Rockefeller
Center, just south of Saks Fifth Avenue.

NEW YORK POLICE ARREST 23 HOMELESS IN WAKE OF ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acting on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's declaration that a
civilized city should not tolerate people sleeping on its streets,
police officers arrested 23 homeless people over the weekend, all
for disorderly conduct, and referred another 127 people to shelters
after sweeping through 850 locations across the city that are known
as havens for the homeless, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced on
Friday that the police would redouble efforts to keep the homeless
off the streets in response to the attack last week on a midtown
Manhattan office worker who was struck in the head with a brick.
Police officials said they believe the assailant was a homeless
man, possibly mentally ill, but they have no suspects and have not
made an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   While they announced that the arrests of the homeless had been
made on Friday and Saturday nights, police officials on Sunday
night did not provide a breakdown of where the arrests had taken
place, and said they could not immediately determine to which
shelters they had referred those who were not arrested. They also
did not say how long the crackdown would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by city officials that a crackdown on the
homeless had been launched over the weekend came as Assistant Chief
William Taylor Jr., the commander of Manhattan detectives, said
that the investigation into the attack on 27-year-old Nicole
Barrett seemed to be hitting dead ends, even with 40 to 60
investigators working on the case around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Sunday that six witnesses looking at thousands of
photographs of violent criminals had failed to find one matching
the assailant. He said that tips phoned into the police department
also had produced no leads. ``We have had about 20 calls,'' he
said. ``They have all been checked out, with negative results. We
need more calls. We are going to be looking to talk to anybody and
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief said that detectives were planning to establish a
temporary command post at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, where the
attack took place, and another at 74th Street and Madison Avenue,
where they believe the paving stone was taken from, in hopes that
more witnesses will come forward. He said all leads were being
followed. ``We have been all over this city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, who moved to New York last year from her hometown
of Athens, Texas, was struck in the back of the head with a 6-pound
paving stone on Tuesday afternoon as she prepared to cross Madison
Avenue. She was unconscious for two days but has since opened her
eyes and spoken a few words. She remained in critical but stable
condition on Sunday at Bellevue Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the attack on Ms. Barrett, The Daily News
published a two-page editorial on Friday headlined ``Get the
Violent Crazies Off Our Streets.'' Giuliani, on his weekly radio
show the same morning, said that the homeless had no right to sleep
on the city's streets and he vowed that the city would step up its
efforts. Later in the day, Safir said those efforts might include
increased arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streets do not exist in civilized cities for the purpose of
people sleeping there,'' Giuliani said on the radio. ``Bedrooms are
for sleeping, and a society moves as a progressive society as it
convinces more and more people that they shouldn't be sleeping on
its streets.'' He continued, ``You do not have a right to sleep on
the streets of New York City,'' adding, ``The founding fathers
never put that in their constitution.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But on Saturday and through most of Sunday, the police announced
no arrests, and it appeared that the threats of a crackdown on the
homeless might have been overstated. Despite Safir's comments on
Friday, his spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, said the next day that
arrests would not increase. ``There is simply not a crackdown on
the homeless,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mode had said that homeless people would be arrested only
for such violations as violent behavior or disturbing the peace,
and she cited data for 1998 showing that of 64,424 complaints about
people who were described as emotionally disturbed, 24,787 were
taken to hospitals and 551 were arrested. Until the past weekend,
only about 100 homeless people had been arrested all year, a city
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was reason to question whether the mayor's pledge to
``put even more emphasis'' on keeping people from sleeping on the
streets would actually entail additional arrests. On his radio
show, the mayor never threatened to have homeless people arrested.
He urged New Yorkers not to jump to conclusions about the brick
attack and said that more needed to be done to help the mentally
ill homeless.
</P>
<P>
   On the radio show Friday morning, Giuliani first urged people
not to assume that the suspect in the brick attack was mentally
ill. ``We haven't caught the person who did it,'' he said. ``So it
may not be.'' And he warned against stereotyping the mentally ill.
``There are many people that are mentally ill that are treated,
treatable and able to maintain absolutely error-free lives,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the state and local governments should do more to
help the mentally ill. ``If you were going to let people out of the
mental institutions, then there have to be services,'' he said,
vowing to take up the cause. ``You know, for outpatient treatment.
And those services have never been funded at the levels of which
they should.''

HOMELESS VETERAN CHALLENGES CITY HALL IN COURT
</HEADLINE>
  (With HOMELESS-CRACKDOWN) 
(nk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even before New York's police commissioner pledged
last week to arrest homeless people who persist in sleeping on
sidewalks, a homeless Army veteran who has improvised a bed on the
city's streets for a decade was quietly trying to stop him through
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the veteran, Augustine Betancourt, 33, is an
unlikely legal adversary. But nobody knows better that the
announced police tactic is not new. Nobody more clearly illustrates
its mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three years ago, on the cold night of Feb. 27, 1997,
Betancourt tucked himself into cardboard and fell asleep on a bench
in a small park across the street from the Criminal Courts building
in Lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   About 1:30 a.m., he was awakened by two police officers. And for
the first time in his life, he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct order from Giuliani,'' one officer told Betancourt
before handcuffing him and taking him to jail, according to court
affidavits. ``You're not supposed to be sleeping here.''
</P>
<P>
   Betancourt, a slight, soft-spoken man who has shunned most
social interaction since his honorable discharge in 1987, was
strip-searched, held for 27 hours and handed a summons. The ticket,
on an obscure sanitation code violation _ one of several ordinances
typically used by the police to arrest or ticket the homeless _
turned out to be invalid.
</P>
<P>
   But in Betancourt vs. Giuliani, a little-noticed 1997 federal
class-action lawsuit now nearing a conclusion, Betancourt and the
lawyer he found in a soup kitchen's legal clinic have mounted a
small but significant challenge to police crackdowns on the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that he and all 25 others in the park area
the same night were falsely arrested in a police sweep for
violating a sanitation ordinance that was impermissibly vague, and
only a pretext for punishing the homeless. It asks that this use of
the ordinance be barred.
</P>
<P>
   The city argues that the arrests were legitimate and necessary
to reclaim the area near the Criminal Courts building from debris
left by homeless people who had rejected earlier offers of shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Betancourt is still homeless. But now he sleeps in an alley not
far from the park, hidden in a cardboard box. And since he was
dropped from the welfare rolls three years ago for failing to
appear for a work assignment, he will not qualify for a shelter bed
at all if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani succeeds in his other effort to
tackle homelessness: enforcing state regulations that make work and
all other welfare rules conditions of shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The years I spent out in the street, people watch me collect
cans or kids laugh when they see me at night getting into a
cardboard box, I've never felt insulted or less than human,''
Betancourt, who won a merit award as a soldier, said in a
deposition. ``But incarcerated, I felt deprived of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was a mistake to arrest Betancourt under a sanitation
statute that makes it unlawful to leave ``any box, barrel, bale of
merchandise or other movable property'' in a public place _ the
district attorney declined to prosecute the case _ the city
contends that he still could have been legitimately arrested for
any number of other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 police manual for carrying out such sweeps, ``Quality of
Life Enforcement Options: A Police Reference Guide,'' lists 35
offenses that can prompt an arrest, including camping in the park
without a permit and being present after the official 1 a.m.
closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a Midtown office worker was left in critical
condition by a random attack that may have been committed by a
homeless man, Giuliani promised to renew such crackdowns. He
dismissed any civil liberties opposition to his plan as romanticism
that did the homeless no favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streets do not exist in civilized societies for the purpose of
people sleeping there,'' the mayor said. ``Bedrooms are for
sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir seconded the mayor's remarks,
declaring that if homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks refuse
help from the police and then ``don't obey, we're going to arrest
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For city lawyers defending against the Betancourt suit, the
remarks came at an awkward moment. Betancourt's lawyer Doug Lasdon,
who directs the nonprofit Urban Justice Center, has argued that the
Giuliani administration has transformed administrative ordinances
into anti-vagrancy laws in a bid to outlaw homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   The city has responded in legal papers that there is no police
policy aimed at the homeless. In September 1997, the city
successfully opposed the plaintiffs' demand for a preliminary
injunction that would have temporarily barred such enforcement of
the sanitation ordinance, arguing in part that Betancourt and his
fellows had not established that they were at risk of being
arrested again.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the plaintiffs filed briefs asking that the court
immediately bar the city from such enforcement of the ordinance.
Judge John S. Martin of federal District Court in Manhattan could
rule early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people that you don't see that are actually most
vulnerable to these anti-homeless laws and ordinances, because
they're most reluctant to seek help,'' Betancourt, who does not
smoke or drink, said in a recent interview, completely unobtrusive
in his plain black baseball cap, white T-shirt, checked shirt and
khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motivation in this lawsuit doesn't have anything to do with
money or some kind of vendetta against the city,'' he said. ``My
motivation is to avoid any further disruption and living like a
fugitive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Police depositions in the case open a rare window on the broad
discretion an ordinance can afford. One officer testified that a
person sitting on a park bench wearing a coat around the shoulders
would be in violation of the section, but would not be in violation
if the coat were zipped up.
</P>
<P>
   Another testified that a person sitting beside a newspaper that
was ``touching their body'' would not violate the code, but the
person could be arrested if the same newspaper was ``one inch
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city's history, officials have periodically
enforced vagrancy laws that blurred the line between poverty and
criminality. In ``Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898''
(Oxford University Press, 1999), Mike Wallace and Edwin G. Burrows
describe how early in the 19th century, vagrancy laws were used for
street roundups ``at the behest of merchants and shopkeepers
determined to improve New York's business climate by scouring away
peddlers, scavengers, beggars and potential criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s and again in the 1890s, an increase in street
begging and pauperism that historians attribute to economic
dislocations led reformers to discontinue or tighten municipal poor
relief, and to step up enforcement of vagrancy statutes, arresting
and locking up ``tramps'' and sending them to workhouses.
</P>
<P>
   A series of high court rulings from the 1950s through the 1970s
invalidated the old vagrancy laws. In a recent case, in 1995, the
U.S. District court in Manhattan ruled that people arrested or
ejected from Pennsylvania Station by the Amtrak police for
``hanging out'' there had been deprived of their constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Like people in cities around the country, many New Yorkers went
from compassion to exasperation about the homeless in the 1980s.
Despite the city's uniquely far-reaching right to shelter,
established by advocates through court rulings in 1981, there
seemed to be disheveled figures huddling on every Manhattan
sidewalk grate in 1987, when Betancourt returned to New York after
three years in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   He soon stopped contact with his elderly immigrant parents, who
were unaware, he said, of the deep depression and anxiety attacks
that had overwhelmed him in adolescence. His jobs as kitchen helper
or stock clerk grew scarcer after the stock market crashed in 1987,
and in 1988 he lost his room in a cheap hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly turning to the city's homeless shelter system, he was
placed in a shelter in the Bronx, where about 600 men, many
mentally ill or addicted to drugs, slept on a drill floor. He found
the street less frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Someone helped him obtain public assistance in 1992, about $100
every two weeks. But he was one of thousands who were dropped from
the rolls when the city instituted a strict workfare requirement in
August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Betancourt did become more self-reliant, though not
as city welfare officials had envisioned: he dug himself deeper
into a solitary groove of life bound by the schedules of soup
kitchens and shower programs, coping with his constant anxiety by
killing time in libraries and bookstores, paring down his needs to
what would fit in a small book bag, and hunting nightly for
cardboard to make his bed.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's first round of sweeps in 1996 were welcomed by many
New Yorkers. But though they broke up major encampments of homeless
people and offered services, their limitations quickly became
apparent. In monthly spread sheets laid out by location, internal
reports by the Department of Homeless Services reflect that
homeless people routed from one place showed up somewhere else, or
ebbed back to the old spot over time.
</P>
<P>
   Issued summonses, many homeless people failed to show up in
court, resulting in bench warrants later used to arrest them. Many
spent time in jail on Rikers Island, where mental health unit beds
cost $91,000 a year, compared with $20,000 for a city shelter bed
and $12,000 for the supervised apartments that have been the
greatest success for the mentally ill homeless, but remain in short
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Annual admissions at the jail reached an all-time high of
133,300 in 1997, up from 106,000 in 1993. Admissions are now about
127,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx shelter that frightened away Betancourt in 1988 was
cut to 200 beds through lawsuits brought by advocates for the
homeless. More than 70 percent of the shelter system is now run by
private nonprofit agencies, mostly in smaller rehabilitation
programs under contract to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But through shelter regulations that Giuliani himself sought
from the state, the legal right to shelter underpinning this
improved system is now under challenge as never before.

 &HT;    NASCAR: Pressure runs high for family members
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Dotti Park sat in a director's chair behind the
No. 1 pit stall. Headphones covered her ears, a scanner in one
hand. She rocked her left foot back and forth, casually off the
ground, as if she were sitting for a manicure.
</P>
<P>
   She hadn't planned to sit there long. She usually watches her
son, Steve, drive a Winston Cup race until his first pit stop. Then
she retreats to the team hauler or motorcoach, where she can pace
around nervously in private.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven, as she likes to call him, was having a remarkable
day during most of Sunday's NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
More than 250 laps in, it was difficult to leave pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get worked up,'' Dotti said. ``It's nerve-wracking. No
matter how old your child gets, it's still your child out there
doing 190 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, though, that when your child is leading 10 different
times for 72 laps and hanging around the front for most of the
race, it can calm a mother's nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, I usually pace a lot,'' Dotti said. ``I try to
walk and keep my blood pressure down. If I'm home, I'll go outside
and walk circles around the house. The neighbors usually know when
Steven's racing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR of the '90s has evolved as a true family experience.
You see it before the race, when Brooke Gordon, walks hand-in-hand
with husband Jeff to his race car. You heard it Sunday, when the
children of the drivers and crew stood on the track and yelled,
``Gentlemen, start your engines.''
</P>
<P>
   You see it in the pit stalls and on the top of haulers, where
family members perch with their scanners and headsets. They also
serve who watch and worry.
</P>
<P>
   Or they retreat to the quiet comfort of their motor home, parked
at trackside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past standing on the truck or sitting in the pit (to watch
husband Mark),'' Arlene Martin said. ``I'm 46, I'm too old to be
doing that. I did that in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   After she had taken Matt, 7, to the Motor Racing Outreach (MRO)
kids Bible club, she headed for her motorhome, prepared lunch and
sat back to watch the race on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Matt watches the races, too. ''He likes the end of the race the
best,'' Arlene said. ``He wants to see who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotti Park started bringing her kid to race tracks when he was a
couple of months old. The first date she went on with her husband,
Bob, was at a race track. He still drives Modifieds when he's not
working on transmissions for Steven's boss, Dale Earnhardt. She
runs Steven's Fan Club.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched her son race since he started in go-karts at the
age of 10, Dotti is well aware of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had the conversation once,'' she said. ``He said if
anything should ever happen to him, he wanted me to remember that
this is what he loved to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She was at a Modified race four years ago when her son went
airborne and came down on his roof. ``That was scary,'' she said,
``but he was fine.'' Still, she was a bit uneasy coming to AMS,
where Steven had a terrible crash last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst experience I ever had,'' Dotti said. ``I was
packed and ready to go when he hit the wall last year. I saw it on
television. I didn't know if he was all right. I knew it was bad
when I saw everybody around him. But Dale Earnhardt himself called
me from the care center and made his plane available to my husband
and I and got us down here as quickly as he could. That made things
a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   This time out, it was like a Sunday drive. A bad late pit-stop
cost Park track position, however, and as Dotti left her chair to
pace the asphalt behind the pit, the son faded to 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Jones said it's been difficult being the opinionated
father of a race car driver and his team owner. But he's learned to
back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Buckshot have an agreement: I can have a head phone but
I can't press the button to talk,'' Billy said. ``I let Buckshot
and the crew handle the car.'' He gets tempted to press the button,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I take the mike and fold it in and push it to the
back, so if I do get tempted and push the button I can't say
nothing. It's tough. I've always been a person who wants his hands
on the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy's input used to come in the middle of races when Buckshot
was running All-Pros. ``I was bad,'' he said. Then the son sat the
father down for a chat as they were graduating to the Busch series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I disrupted him and what the team had in mind to do.
He felt like it would be better if I let them do it even though I
was paying the bills,'' Billy said. ``He felt like if I wanted to
say anything I should do it prior to the race or wait till the race
ended and then talk about it. So that's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he visited his team. ``I shake their hand, hug their
neck, tell them what a great job they've done.'' Then he busied
himself welcoming his 376 family and business guests at the two
condos and three trackside suites he had rented.
</P>
<P>
   Then he found a quiet place to watch the race by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very emotional guy,'' Billy said. ``If he's running dead
last and he starts passing cars, I get very excited about it. And
anytime he gets around the front I'm definitely that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional business. Let's face it, what other business
do you know of that one minute you can be on top and in one second
you're at the bottom?''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the entire Jones clan was up on the penthouse level.
Billy joked that he had assigned an employee named Brett, who is
big enough to be a nightclub bouncer, to watch Buckshot's sister.
``To keep her out of somebody else's garage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this time Buckshot comes to me and he says `D,
(short for Dad) you need to talk to Laytona. Every time somebody
bumps me on the race track, she's down there ready to fight them. I
told her every time somebody hits me out there, it doesn't mean
it's deliberate. This is the business, you rub each other.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little talk with her and she said, `D, I don't care
what Buckshot said, that guy deliberately done it and when I see
him I'm gonna whip him. I would have whipped him that day but he
got away.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Laytona _ ``No, I wasn't named after Daytona,'' she said _
laughed in embarrassment about having to explain this family
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was back in his Lanier (Speedway) days, and I didn't know
that's how racing was,'' Laytona said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first race I'd ever been to. I don't do that
anymore, I know better now. I usually try to stay in the condo, the
bleachers, wherever I can be out of the way. I get a little bit
upset sometimes. But, hey, that's my brother.''

JETS CATCH BUFFALO WITH THEIR GUARD DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It's too soon to tell whether the New
York Jets' 17-7 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday will have
any significance, but the Jets continue to surprise everyone but
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Who believed a few weeks ago that a punchless team with a 1-6
record would put together a three-game winning streak that at least
mathematically keeps their playoff possibilities alive?
</P>
<P>
   The Bills had arrived at the Meadowlands with a 7-3 record,
including one convincing victory over the Jets already this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Doug Flutie was almost as perplexed Sunday by Bill
Belichick's defense as the Patriots' Drew Bledsoe was last Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bills Coach Wade Phillips admitted his offense was not
prepared for the Jets' surprises on defense: blitzing at unexpected
times; alternating a 4-3 alignment with a 3-4; deflecting four
passes at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The mixing and matching led to a second-quarter touchdown by the
defense when Ray Mickens, who at 5 feet 8 is even smaller than the
5-foot-10 Flutie, blitzed the Buffalo quarterback in the end zone,
bowled him over and knocked the ball loose. The second-year
defensive end Eric Ogbogu pounced on the ball for a touchdown that
gave the Jets command of the game with a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to blitz our spread package, which surprised
us,'' Phillips said, adding that the blitzing bothered Flutie
throughout the game _ one of the few times in his second coming to
the league that a team has been able to capitalize on the
quarterback's stature.
</P>
<P>
   These Jets are suddenly and dramatically different from the team
that lost to Buffalo in the second game of the season, a game in
which the Bills piled up 224 rushing yards. Ray Lucas is now the
up-tempo quarterback in place of the ineffective Rick Mirer, and
nose tackle Jason Ferguson is back after missing that first
meeting. So is wide receiver Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the early season Jets by any stretch. Their
defense didn't fold late in the game (or early, for that matter).
The Bills converted only 29 percent of their third downs (less than
half of what they managed in the first meeting). Their rushing
total was barely a quarter of what they managed in the first game;
they gained a mere 60 yards Sunday _ and almost half of that came
on one Flutie scamper.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets said their switching defensive alignment helped account
for the change. By playing much of the game with four defensive
linemen instead of three, the Jets made it more difficult for
Flutie to see downfield or escape on the run while rolling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to keep it tight enough so that he couldn't
scramble,'' Jets Coach Bill Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so scared the first game that Flutie would take off,''
Ferguson said. ``The 4-3 keeps him honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills made it to the Jets' side of the field three times in
the opening half and came away with nothing. (Steve Christie twice
missed field-goal attempts.) In the second half they crossed
midfield only twice, scoring their lone touchdown and then losing
the ball on an interception _ the Bills' third turnover of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Parcells' beaming endorsement of his Jets: ``I'm really
proud of them _ as proud of a team as I've been in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Are they stronger now than they were earlier?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Parcells said. ``I just keep telling the team
it's too soon to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lucas is now 2-1 as a starter, he did not propel the
Jets' offense to a scoring spree. The only touchdown the offense
produced came on his 9-yard run early in the second quarter. But it
was the fourth first-half touchdown the Jets have scored in his
last two starts; Mirer directed touchdown drives in the opening
half in only three of his six starts.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after Lucas' scoring run, Tom Tupa launched a punt
that was headed for the end zone. Instead, Chris Hayes came
charging downfield, intent on batting it back in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Dwight Stone in front of me and I yelled, `Stone, get
out of the way,''' Hayes said. He jumped over the goal line and
while still in mid-air pushed the ball toward the field. Parmalee
downed it on the 3 _ for Hayes' third major play on special teams
in the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Backed up at their goal line, the Bills were vulnerable to
Mickens' blitz, which probably was the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas did keep the Jets moving, connecting on his first eight
passing attempts. He particularly was fond of Keyshawn Johnson on
third down and Curtis Martin any time. In fact, Martin led all Jets
receivers with seven catches _ compared with only one in the first
Jets-Bills meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who studied the Bills since that game, concluded that
although the Bills were one of the best in pro football in stopping
the run, they were vulnerable to a runner coming out of the
backfield to catch a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't always account for him,'' left tackle Jumbo
Elliott said of Martin. ``Once he got out there as a receiver, he
could make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were making things happen in other areas. In one drive
they tried a few tricks. Early in the third quarter, Lucas handed
the ball to Johnson on an apparent reverse, but Johnson stopped and
unloaded a long pass goalward toward Chrebet. It went just beyond
Chrebet's reach. Three players later, John Hall lined up for a
53-yard field-goal attempt _ and instead punted the ball to the
Bills' 2, where it was downed by Fred Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives later Hall did attempt a field goal, converting a
36-yarder. On the ensuing drive, the Bills produced their only
score _ a Flutie-to-Peerless Price 2-yard touchdown pass play.
</P>
<P>
   But the next two Buffalo drives were over in less than 95
seconds each, and then the Jets punctuated the performance when
Ernie Logan, 5 inches taller than Flutie, raised his arms, batted a
pass that ricocheted off the Jets' rookie Jason Wiltz, onto the
back of a Bills lineman, and back into Wiltz's hands for an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great honor,'' Wiltz said later.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas feels like a rookie himself, at least as a quarterback,
but he said he now felt like the Jets' starter. ``After your first
play, a rookie's basically over being a rookie,'' he said. &QL;

WILLIAM NICKERSON, 91, WRITER OF POPULAR INVESTMENT BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore.)  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William E. Nickerson, who made millions of dollars from real
estate investments and millions more writing books telling others
how to do the same thing, died on Oct. 19 at his home in Capitola,
Calif. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting his strong religious beliefs as a lifelong
Congregationalist, he gave away his entire estate to pay for
student scholarships and professorships to divinity and religiously
oriented schools that he considered ``ecumenically and
pluralistically minded.''
</P>
<P>
   These included Harvard Divinity School, Yale Divinity School,
Piedmont College, Andover Newton Theological School, Union
Theological Seminary, Chicago Theological Seminary, Colgate
Rochester Divinity School and Pacific School of Religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I Turned $1,000 Into a Million in Real Estate _ in My
Spare Time'' became a famous book and a catchphrase in the 1960s
and 1970s. It came out in 1959. In later editions the $1 million
return became $5 million. The book was full of practical advice,
typified by its first line, ``The road to riches is paved with
borrowed money.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the book, published by Simon &AMP; Schuster, has been out of
print for decades, its influence persists, with reviews still
posted by readers on the Amazon.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used this book to make several million dollars for myself,
and taught two friends to use the book, and they also made
substantial money,'' a man who identified himself as a Houston
reader wrote this July. ``It shows you how real estate wealth is
made, and shows you step by step how to do it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Richard Pennant of Seattle, who said his hobby
was reading real estate books, wrote, ``This is easily the most
concise and informative tome on the subject of acquiring wealth
through investing in real estate that I have ever read.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson was born in Grants Pass, Ore., and graduated from high
school in Fresno, Calif. He was captivated with the idea of
adventure, partly to collect ideas for the books he planned to
write, and he hiked from Fresno to Mount Ayr, Iowa, and back the
summer after high school.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled at Fresno State College, but left the next spring to
work and hike his way around the world. He visited countries from
Peru to Holland to Singapore, often traveling as a seaman on
merchant ships. After three years of this itinerant life, he
returned to Fresno State, where he graduated with a major in
English and psychology.
</P>

THERE'S NO DEFENDING THE GIANTS' OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Where there was a late drive, there was also a
late fumble. Where there was a late stop, there was also a late
penalty. Where there were defensive heroics, there were also gaping
holes. Where the offense looked rejuvenated under a new leader, it
also scored just one touchdown against the worst defense in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   For every positive these New York Giants create, their penchant
is to match it with a negative. And so, 10 games into the 1999
season, the Giants have won five and lost five. The story of this
persistently inconsistent team remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 23-13 loss to the Washington Redskins was a season in
microcosm. Although sparked by the backup quarterback Kerry
Collins, who entered the game in the second quarter when Kent
Graham sustained a concussion, the offense committed five
turnovers; one fumble was returned for a Redskins touchdown. The
Giants rushed for only 72 yards and they were whistled for 7
penalties totaling 97 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proud Giants defense gave up 183 rushing yards to
Stephen Davis, the most by a running back in the NFL this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way too many self-inflicting wounds,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel
said. ``I can't fault effort or desire. But the mistakes are
killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Redskins (6-4) never trailed, the game's outcome
hinged on two sequences in the final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington leading, 20-13, Collins had the Giants on the
move and at the Redskins' 27-yard line. On first down, Collins,
whose practice time with the first-string center Brian Williams has
been limited, fumbled the snap.
</P>
<P>
   Collins missed one chance to recover the bouncing ball, as did
fullback Charles Way. It was recovered by Washington's Kenard Lang
_ a stunning blow to the Giants, who had already scored one
fourth-quarter touchdown and had advanced the ball 53 yards on the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure we were going to score,'' running back Tiki Barber
said. ``We had them on their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who completed 13 of 21 passes for 221 yards with one
interception, took the blame for the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inexcusable,'' he said. ``I pulled out early, trying to
play fast. That's all on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Giants had time to salvage a victory. Collins' fumble
came with four minutes left in the game, and on third-and-3 at the
Washington 46-yard line with 3 minutes 8 seconds left, the Giants
tackled Washington quarterback Brad Johnson short of a first down.
</P>
<P>
   After the play, Washington tackle Jon Jansen collided with
Giants safety Percy Ellsworth and Ellsworth retaliated by falling
on Jansen with his arms striking Jansen in the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   It drew a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Six plays and
nearly three minutes later, the Redskins' Brett Conway kicked a
37-yard field goal that sealed their victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Percy thought he got hit late and maybe he did,'' Fassel said.
``But you can't make that mistake. You just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth said: ``I hurt my team. I can't do that. I apologize
to my teammates, no matter what he did to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants would not have had a late chance to tie the game if
Conway had successfully converted any of the three field goals he
missed. Conway almost singlehandedly kept the Giants in the game,
missing from 38 yards early in the second quarter, from 50 yards in
the third quarter and from 27 yards with 6:07 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants were barely able to capitalize. Collins, who will
most likely remain the starting quarterback given Graham's injury
and ineffectiveness Sunday, did lead the Giants on a nine-play,
71-yard drive early in the fourth quarter. Two passes to David
Patten, another to Barber and an 18-yard pass to Amani Toomer on
third-and-16 put the Giants on the 3-yard line. Two plays and a
penalty later, Way scored on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in that drive, it appeared that Collins had completed a
21-yard touchdown pass in the corner of the end zone to the rookie
running back Sean Bennett. But the officials ruled that Bennett had
juggled the ball as he was falling to the grass, where it was
knocked from his hands. The Giants challenged the ruling through
the new instant-replay system, then discovered that an official's
judgment that a pass was juggled cannot be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught it,'' Bennett said. ``I had it trapped against my
right shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants would score a few minutes later to get back in the
game. But the game-winning play came in the opening minutes of the
fourth quarter, when Collins was stripped of the football as he
waited to pass in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Ndukwe Kalu beat Giants left tackle Roman Oben,
racing around Oben to slap the ball out of Collins's right hand. It
popped into the hands of Washington's Marco Coleman, who sprinted
42 yards for a touchdown that gave the Redskins a 20-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Redskins' touchdowns, in the first quarter,
followed a questionable pass interference call in the end zone on
the Giants' Phillippi Sparks. Sparks was covering Washington wide
receiver Albert Connell and appeared to make a good deflection of a
Johnson pass when he was whistled for the penalty. On the next
play, Davis scored on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   After another fruitless Giants series, Ellsworth, who was
playing for the first time in a month because of a broken foot,
intercepted a Johnson pass. Ellsworth's return brought the football
to the Redskins' 30-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   In four plays, the Giants' offense advanced the football just 4
yards. That was enough for Cary Blanchard to make a 44-yard field
goal, cutting Washington's lead to 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants could not enjoy that for long. Davis got loose for a
49-yard run up the sideline that led to a 24-yard Conway field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   After Graham, who completed 3 of 10 passes for 36 yards and two
interceptions, left the game, Collins did lead the Giants on a
stirring drive at the end of the half, moving the Giants 71 yards
in 1:40 to set up another 44-yard Blanchard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   As demoralizing as Sunday's loss was to the Giants, they are,
remarkably, not out of the playoff chase or even the race for the
National Football Conference East title. They trail Washington by
just one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky we're in a division where everybody is
faltering,'' said cornerback Jason Sehorn. ``We've got six games.
Washington will lose again. We've got time. It's not like we're in
the AFC East. And that's a good thing.''

ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER DEFENDS HILLARY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel offered an
unprompted defense on Sunday of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who stirred
up a political contretemps on a trip to the Middle East when she
sat silent as Palestinian leaders verbally attacked Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's comments were in sharp contrast to critical statements
issued by some Jewish groups in the United States who became
enraged earlier this month after Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, accused Israel of poisoning
Palestinian air and water and using cancer-causing toxic gas in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who sat silently during speeches by Mrs. Arafat
and other Palestinians but later issued a statement denouncing
their accusations, returned to the United States with the possible
prospect of losing support for her exploratory Senate campaign
among some New York Jewish voters, who are likely to be important
in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's comments by Barak could temper at least some of
that criticism. Barak spoke at the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations, the largest umbrella
organization of American Jewish groups, at the Helmsley Park Lane
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about reports that he had called Yasser Arafat
to complain about Mrs. Arafat's comments, he responded that Mrs.
Arafat's remarks were ``baseless'' and ``kind of damaging.'' Such
rhetoric, he said, should be suppressed by Palestinian leaders as
the peace process moves into a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
   Barak then volunteered that he had read ``a lot of criticism''
of Mrs. Clinton in the aftermath of her visit to the West Bank. He
wanted to make clear, he said, that her trip to the Middle East was
``a highly successful, highly moving visit'' that had drawn
attention to youth violence in Israel. During her trip to the
Middle East, Mrs. Clinton met with emotionally troubled adolescents
who are counseled in a program headed by Nava Barak, the prime
minister's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the first lady's visit to Israel contributed to the
peace process in spite of this incident,'' he said, and added,
``May I tell you frankly as prime minister of Israel that myself
and all my successors will always wish to have two such friends as
the Clintons in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   While Barak's statement of support may not have been surprising
_ he has close ties to the Clintons and has shared a campaign
consultant, James Carville, with them _ it came at an important
period for Mrs. Clinton, who has sometimes had disputes with Jewish
voters over her views. Last year, for example, she was criticized
for saying she believed that the creation of a Palestinian state
was critical to achieving a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   And she already faced the difficult prospect of wooing Jewish
voters away from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is expected to run
against her for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory
Senate campaign committee, said Sunday that he was gratified by
Barak's statement. ``We appreciate the prime minister's comments,''
he said. ``It speaks volumes about the first lady's commitment to a
safe and secure Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's speech was warmly received. As expected, he extensively
discussed the peace process, reiterating his commitment to moving
forward with negotiating a ``final status'' agreement with Israel's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything must be put on the table,'' he said. ``Settlements,
borders, refugees, the nature of the Palestinian entity, economic
relations, security relations, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said such an agreement could not be based on documents
alone, but ``should be based on the military might of the Israeli
Defense Force, our strategic capability, a unique alliance with the
United States and a growing economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an effort to broaden the dialogue with American
Jews beyond the peace process, Barak dwelt on the need to expand
Israel's economy, and on the country's socioeconomic stresses.
Recent statistics revealed record unemployment in Israel, and a gap
between rich and poor second only to that in the United States in
the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also visited Cardinal John O'Connor at his residence
Sunday, traveling down Fifth Avenue in a security-laden motorcade.

A DISGUSTED GIANTS DEFENSE IS POINTING FINGERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ This is becoming the same old sad, miserable
story for the New York Giants. It keeps repeating itself, like a
bad dream, or Bill Murray's tripping out in ``Groundhog Day.'' The
Giants' offense is so bad it was practically shut down by the worst
defense in the NFL. The Giants' offense is so bad that quarterback
Kent Graham was on the sideline late in the second quarter, taking
smelling salts, his head woozy from yet another concussion after
enduring a half-dozen nasty shots from the Washington Redskins'
terrible defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   This situation has become so frustrating that defensive players,
for the first time all season, openly ripped into their offensive
counterparts after the Giants' miserable 23-13 loss Sunday. Nothing
and no one was spared. This is quickly becoming a dangerous
situation for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something needs to be done because this is just crazy,'' said
linebacker Jessie Armstead, in a moment alone, expressing the most
frustration he ever has in his seven-year professional career.
``The guys on offense need to fight as hard as we do. It just makes
you crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what is going on over there,'' he said of the
offense. ``As far as the coaching or who brings in the players,
maybe the administration needs to do something. I don't know if
it's the players or the coaches or what. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was sure he wanted to say these things
publicly, Armstead kicked his acerbic, but true, words into another
gear. ``Look, all I can tell you is that any time you hold an
offense to 13 points, one of the best offenses in the league, what
more do you want?'' (Actually, 16 Redskins points came from their
offense. One touchdown resulted from a run with a fumble.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how many yards they had on the ground. Stats are
for losers. Points win games. Not stats. And there have been too
many times when our defense is out there, for too long, and what do
you want from us?''
</P>
<P>
   Armstead later suggested that he would play quarterback in
addition to linebacker if it would help.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead's frustration was echoed by a number of defensive
players. It is understandable. After watching weeks of an offense
that does not know how to win, that constantly makes mistakes, and
always relies on the defense to bail the team out of trouble,
Giants defenders would not be human if they didn't express
frustration and anger as they did after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Michael Strahan said that the Giants ``always find
a way to lose instead of a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's because we don't believe in ourselves or
what,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he really meant the offense instead of the entire
team, Strahan said, ``What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Said another defensive player, who asked not to be identified:
``I would love to go against our offense. No one respects our
offense. Not a team in the league does and I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other defensive players pinpointed specific offensive players
and added that coach Jim Fassel should make wholesale changes if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Tiki Barber was asked if he could sense the
frustration of the defensive players. ``I don't sense it,'' he
said. ``But if I was them, I would be. They held them to 13 points.
We gave up a touchdown. That should be enough to win. The dropped
passes, the fumble at the end of the game, the small things are
killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   For a game of such magnitude the Giants' offense seemed so
uninspired and unimaginative. A New York victory meant taking
control of the NFC East. There was another element. Washington blew
out the Giants earlier in the season, 50-21. The Giants talked
about how embarrassing that was. They would get revenge. The
Redskins would pay.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the offense missed the memo which said there was pride
at stake in this game. The defense did not, again carrying the
Giants, playing arrogant, bold football.
</P>
<P>
   One series typified the spunk of the defense and the timidity of
the offense. Giants safety Percy Ellsworth intercepted a Brad
Johnson pass intended for Albert Connell. Toward the end of
Ellsworth's 26-yard return, 300-pound Giants defensive tackle Keith
Hamilton launched his entire body into fullback Mike Sellers, who
was trying to make the tackle on Ellsworth. As the hit unfolded,
Sellers' body crumpled up the way someone crushes a piece of paper.
It was the kind of inspiring, and frankly violent, block that
should have inspired the offense. It did the defense as it jumped
up and down in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to knock his head off,'' said Hamilton, ``because I
thought that might maybe inspire not just the defense but the
offense as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice try. After that play the Giants' offense moved the
ball just 4 yards on four plays and settled for a 44-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Before being knocked out of the game only minutes before the end
of the first half, Graham had just three completions, which equaled
the number of times he was sacked. On their first four possessions
the Giants punted twice and Graham was intercepted twice. Running
back LeShon Johnson missed a block that led to Graham getting hit
hard and landing directly on his head the first of three times.
Wide receiver Joe Jurevicius dropped a pass that hit him square in
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, Giants defensive players, bunched together,
just shook their heads. They had seen this before. Only this time,
they had seen too much of it, and they weren't going to remain
quiet.  &QL;

AT VASSAR, A LESSON IN THE VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Utah, Ind.)  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Amid battered picnic tables and grimy
barbecue stands, nine Tibetan monks stood in a park on a rainy
night and cast millions of grains of consecrated sand into the
Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   What they were throwing into the murky waters below the
Mid-Hudson Bridge was the product of 20 hours of careful work over
four days on the Vassar College campus, colored sand in a design so
impossibly intricate that one student said it reminded him of an
infinitely detailed computer-generated design.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mandala, a circular icon that Buddhists use as an aid
to meditation and consider an enlightened vision of the universe.
The monks who made it were at Vassar as part of Tibetan Awareness
Week on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the Drepung Loseling monastery in southern India has
been sending its monks on tours of America, where they make sand
mandalas and perform traditional music and dance to raise awareness
of their culture and the political situation in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   These nine monks have been in America for six months and will
stay through next year. Before they came to Vassar, sponsored by
the Students for a Free Tibet, they had been in Utah and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   All week, as the monks poured the sand into the 3-feet-wide
circular design on a table in a large assembly hall in Main
Building, the college's e-mail system had been buzzing. Students
clutching cups of coffee came by on their way to class, ogling the
glistening pinks and greens of the mandala, and the monks in their
long red robes.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when the design was complete, the monks chanted,
blew horns, clashed cymbals and pushed their extraordinarily
beautiful design into paper soda cups. Then they drove off to pour
it into the river and pray that it would send its healing energies
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would just leave it here,'' said Shree Starkman,
an English major from West Virginia watching the monks at work
earlier in the week. ``Wouldn't it be so cool if we could keep it
here in the Vassar archives?''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Taylor, a psychology major, said, ``I just can't
believe their patience.'' She whispered as she watched them pour
their sand out of steel cones with holy precision. ``To spend so
much time working on something that you're not going to keep,'' she
said, sighing with a disbelief that verged on horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got an A on my German paper,'' said her friend, Lizzy
Tuckerman. Despite her preoccupation with her own achievement, Ms.
Tuckerman, also a psychology major, instantly recognized what the
monks were all about. She recalled that a Tibetan monk who was on
campus the year before said he had been held in prison for 33 years
and tortured. ``But he had no hatred for the people who tortured
him,'' she said. ``It's the same way they're making this. They can
just sweep it away, let it go. I'm not like that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' she said, urging her friends to look over what the
monks were selling. The students ambled away from the mandala to
inspect a table of jewelry and embroidered purses that the monks
had brought to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, money _ Vassar students had raised nearly $7,000 to pay
for the monks' visit _ was one of many surprising aspects of the
Tibetans' monastic reality.
</P>
<P>
   The monks' comfort with American ways was perhaps most evident
at mealtimes. ``I like American food!'' said one monk, grinning as
he sat in front of a towering plate of french fries in the Vassar
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the monks had become quite taken with American culture
during their time here, buying digital watches and L.L. Bean
jackets to wear over their long robes. In Poughkeepsie they ate
pizza, played pool and talked about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The monks are also working, they say, to promote individual and
global spiritual healing, something that was quite attractive to
Vassar students.
</P>
<P>
   Pondering students' interest in the Tibetan cause, E.H. Rick
Jarow, an Eastern religion teacher at Vassar, said: ``Let's face
it, most of these kids come from upper-middle-class families where
all the goals have been achieved, and yet there's still something
missing. It's not the '60s. They're not going to go off and become
monks themselves, but they're very interested in the way that
tradition crosses over to Western culture.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed perfectly logical to Jim Contelmo, a groundsworker
at Vassar who stopped in to watch the mandala being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing lasts forever, I guess that's what it symbolizes,'' he
said, shrugging. ``And beauty is fleeting.''

SPORTS COLUMN: LUCAS IS IN CHARGE OF A REBORN DREAM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There is a large opening at the west end
of Giants Stadium. On game days, the area just inside the opening
is an intersection of hustle and bustle as players scramble to get
on buses, greet family and friends and begin the process of
digesting a tough loss or a heady victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie stood just outside the
intersection and spoke with a group of friends. About 20 yards
away, Jets quarterback Ray Lucas was surrounded by television
cameras. The contrast between Flutie with friends and Lucas with
cameras told the story of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 27, led his surging Jets to a 17-7 victory in the third
start of his pro career. This was a victory that kept the Jets'
slim playoff hopes alive. Lucas completed 16 of 20 passes for 142
yards. More than his passes, Lucas' presence _ Sunday and last
Monday against New England _ provided the Jets with a missing
spark.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, last season's miracle worker, failed to produce a
miracle Sunday. He threw two crucial interceptions, one in the
second quarter with Buffalo on the Jets' 11-yard line, one in the
fourth quarter. Flutie had three passes batted away in crucial
situations. In the fourth quarter, with a first-and-goal play at
the Jets' 10-yard line, Jason Wiltz, the Jets rookie defensive end,
intercepted a batted ball to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the end of this day, Lucas and Flutie were more
kindred spirits than competitors. A part of Flutie cheers Lucas and
a part of Lucas identifies with Flutie _ a player doubted because
of his size, exiled to the Canadian Football League, who finally
enjoyed a renaissance last year with the Bills. The 6-foot-3-inch
Lucas, undrafted in 1997, used as a novelty item and a special
teams star, was finally forced into action this season. He has
become the rhythm and blues the Jets have sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   As Lucas headed down the corridor after the game he spotted
Flutie, they hugged and shook hands. Flutie looked at Lucas as he
walked away and said that perseverance goes a long way. ``If you
don't believe in your own ability and yourself,'' Flutie said,
``you get stepped on.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is stepping on Lucas; not the Bills, not even Keyshawn
Johnson. ``Ray brings that sense of urgency to us,'' Johnson said.
On a second-down play in the fourth quarter Sunday, Lucas tried to
hit Johnson with a slant pass but bounced the ball into the turf.
Johnson came back to the huddle cursing. ``What are you doing?
Don't do that again,'' Johnson said. Without blinking, ``Lucas
swore right back as he called the play,'' Johnson said ```Here's
the play. Run it.''' Lucas proceeded to roll right and zip a
16-yard pass to Wayne Chrebet in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Lucas, the Jets' transformation between Sept.
19 _ when they lost, 17-3, to the Bills in an uninspired
performance _ and Sunday is stunning. A month ago they were
passive, injured and demoralized. The Jets are still hurting, but
all traces of uncertainty have vanished. On Sunday they pulled out
all stops.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Hall, lined up as if to attempt a field goal, instead
lofted a punt that was downed on the 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   _ On a critical punt coverage, Chris Hayes sprinted downfield,
jumped up and threw the punted ball out of the end zone while he
was in midair. The ball was downed at the Buffalo 3-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frank Mickens blitzed Flutie in the end zone, stripped the
ball, then Eric Ogbogu, the rookie defensive end, fell on it for a
Jets touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as proud as I've ever been of a team,'' Parcells
said. Checking his enthusiasm he added: ``It's certainly been a
long time. We'll see what happens now.''
</P>
<P>
   Where do the Jets go from here? After a summer that saw the Mets
turn a nose-dive into a run for the National League championship,
the Jets are hanging on by fingernails and hope. From now until the
dream is crushed, the Jets and their fans will be doing the math
and weighing the possibilities. The Jets are 4-6; Buffalo slipped
to 7-4. Sunday , Parcells and Buffalo coach Wade Phillips talked
about the math.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many losses is this for that team?'' Parcells said,
referring to Buffalo. ``How many do we have? Six? And six games to
go. I'm not all that good in math; it's not probable but it's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, when asked about the Jets' playoff chances, said: ``It
will be hard, but as long as they win every game they're a factor.
I can do the math.'' More than likely the Jets will have to beat
out Buffalo or New England for the final wild card slot. Buffalo is
7-4, New England is 6-4; New England plays Buffalo on Sunday,
guaranteeing that one team will come away with five losses.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo then plays the Giants, at Arizona, at New England and
Indianapolis. New England plays Dallas, at Indianapolis at
Philadelphia, Buffalo and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guesswork for the Jets: they have to win the rest of
their games and finish 10-6 to even have a chance. They play at
Indianapolis on Sunday, then the Giants, Miami, at Dallas, at Miami
and Seattle. From this point on the Jets are playing on emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling them it's too soon to quit,'' Parcells said
Sunday. ``Now you know why I talk like that: because it is, it
really is. There's a lot of football left.''

JOHN D. LE VIEN, 81, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John D. Le Vien, a documentary film producer nominated for two
Oscars, died on Nov. 9 at a hospital in London, where he had lived
for the last 30 years. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Le Vien was also executive producer of ``Black Fox,'' a
90-minute film about Hitler that was narrated by Marlene Dietrich.
It won the Academy Award in 1963 for best documentary. Le Vien was
nominated for Academy Awards as the producer of two documentary
features, ``The Finest Hours'' in 1965 and ``A King's Story'' in
1968. Much of his work evolved from his friendships with Churchill
and the Duke of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   John Douglas Le Vien, known as Jack, was born in New York in
1918. From 1939 to 1940 he worked as an office boy, film editor and
reporter for Pathe News in the United States. In 1941 he entered
the Army as a second lieutenant; he had assignments in the Army's
Bureau of Public Relations in Washington and in London, becoming a
high-ranking press aide to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Le Vien was chief press officer with the Allied Task Force
invading Algeria, and in Tunisia he organized an official press
camp. He did the same in Italy, France and Germany. He took part in
four invasion landings, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel;
he later became a colonel in the Army Reserves. He was awarded the
Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the French Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   From 1946 to 1956 Le Vien was news editor, general manager,
editor in chief and vice president of Pathe News. When Pathe News
shut down in 1956, he joined Hearst Metrotone News in New York as
director of production.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later Le Vien left to be a motion picture and
television producer, leading his own company, Le Vien International
Productions. He also wrote four books, ``The Valiant Years,'' ``The
Finest Hours,'' ``The Duchess of Windsor'' and ``Churchill and the
Generals.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Josephine.

STUDENT WALKOUT PLANNED AT UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Some University of Massachusetts at Amherst
students are planning a walkout Monday to protest what they
consider to be the university's inadequate response to a recent
series of attacks on women on campus.
</P>
<P>
   They say UMass has not boosted campus security sufficiently and
has instead focused on asking women to protect themselves by not
walking alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting responsibility on women rather than on the
school or on the men doing these rapes,'' said Adrien Hilton, a
junior from South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   However, a UMass spokeswoman, Kay Scanlan, said the school has
done everything possible to protect students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has been trying to beef up all these security
issues, and you understand it takes a while to put this together,''
said Scanlan. ``It's straining our services, and I think we've done
a lot in just 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, four women have been assaulted near a pond at
the center of campus, according to school officials. Two rapes
reportedly took place, one Nov. 2 and one Nov. 9. Three men
attacked a woman with a chemical spray and beat her on Nov. 14, and
a man cut a woman's face on Nov. 16, just as 500 people were
demonstrating against incidents of violence on this campus of
25,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   While most students continue to express distress over the
possibility of future attacks, at least a few in the community are
ridiculing the state of alarm and questioning the veracity of the
women's reports of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Students preparing for Monday's walkout were angry Sunday when
they found crude graffiti on a bulletin board at the student union,
which sits next to the pond.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin board, devoted to ``Pondwatch,'' an ad-hoc student
organization patrolling the pond area, included a sign-up sheet for
patrol time slots. The slots had been filled in with such names as
``Ray Pist'' and ``Pete Prowler.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bulletin board, someone had also called reports of the
four assaults a ``scam,'' and compared them to ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' a horror movie.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of Monday's walkout said they expect hundreds of
students to leave classes at 12:30 Monday and join a ``hands around
the pond'' rally.
</P>
<P>
   They are demanding more walking and van escorts, parking lot
patrols, guards on every floor of every campus library, more call
boxes and more dorm security.
</P>
<P>
   Before the recent attacks, UMass had a one-van escort service,
which did not operate 24 hours a day, Scanlan said. Presently, the
campus has four vans operating 24 hours. This weekend, officials
began handing out 10,000 ``shriek alarms,'' and a three-day rape
defense class began Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The university is temporarily allowing students to excuse
themselves from classes if they do not feel safe outdoors. But
Hilton said women would be better served if UMass, instead of
making normal academic obligations optional, would guarantee a safe
passage to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has infringed on my right to a free and safe education,''
Hilton said. ``I want to go to class. That's why I'm here, and
that's what I'm paying money for. It's up to them to find a way for
me to get there safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the walk-out are also demanding that the
administration hold a forum to present to the student body
everything officials know about the four attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As they proclaim the importance of women's rights and safety,
many students say they are troubled by the sense of helplessness
women feel on campus. Women, they say, should not need men to walk
them to the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the attacks are a way to try to isolate
women and make them feel afraid,'' said Chauncy Young, who is
between his junior and senior years. ``They're trying to push
people to a very traditional, patriarchal way of life, where women
shouldn't be independent.''
</P>
<P>
   While a few students said Sunday that some of the tension on
campus has been defused, many women are still living in a state of
anxiety. They say that they eat junk food for dinner in their rooms
rather than walk to the dining hall, take different routes to
class, and travel only in packs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday, I walked to class alone, and I felt physically ill,
I was so nervous,'' said freshman Thea Gallis, who has not walked
alone since then.
</P>
<P>
   A large chunk of the student population has already left for
Thanksgiving break, Scanlan said. Students said Sunday that many of
their friends departed early just because of the attacks. Gallis
said she has decided to leave for Thanksgiving on Tuesday, rather
than Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be home where I feel safe and I know what's
going on,'' Gallis said.

LASSITER INSISTS INJURY TO FRASER WAS NO FOUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ D.C. United striker Roy Lassiter left Foxboro
Stadium on Sunday in denial. He also left with an MLS championship
after United beat the Galaxy 2-0 to claim its third MLS title in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, Lassiter denied Galaxy defender Robin Fraser an
opportunity to play in the biggest match of the season. And at age
32, Fraser might not have many more chances.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter insisted that it was innocent contact that sent Fraser
to the turf, knocking the MLS defender of the year out of the match
in the fifth minute with a broken collarbone. But replays of the
incident show Lassiter throwing an unnecessary forearm to Fraser's
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether I'm there, we still have a good team on
that field,'' Fraser said. ``But it's disappointing for me not to
be able to play against that high-powered offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The play started when Lassiter was looking for a pass down the
right flank. Fraser was a step ahead of him with the ball going
toward the endline. When it appeared Lassiter had no chance of
making a play, he shoved a deliberate forearm to Fraser's back.
Fraser, running full-steam, was knocked off balance, falling to the
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, no call was whistled as Fraser lay helplessly on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both going for the ball and hit each other's arms. He
just ended up falling,'' Lassiter explained. ``When he fell I
didn't think it was that hard. I didn't think it was too much of
anything. The referee didn't think it was anything and the linesman
didn't think it was anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wasn't going in with the intention of fouling
anybody. I was just going in for the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That explanation was interesting to Fraser. ``When he pushed me
from behind, he didn't think I was going to fall?'' asked Fraser.
``That's interesting. That's his perspective. Mine was that I beat
him to the ball, he had no chance to play it and he pushed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a freak accident. You don't expect to fall and
break your collarbone, but it was clear he shoved me.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there an apology from Lassiter?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Fraser. ``But I'll see him again.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be one of the key match-ups of the game.
Lassiter's speed against the experience and smarts of the the
four-time MLS all-star.
</P>
<P>
   With Fraser in a sling on the sideline, Paul Caligiuri moved
back to sweeper as Steve Jolley moved to stopper as Fraser's
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you rely on somebody as heavily as we have Robin the
entire year, to have him drop out and have to throw in Jolley, who
hasn't played in a long time, is a difficult task for all of us,''
Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman said. ``Not only for Jolley to
figure out, but Cal has to be sweeping. It's a matter of almost
relearning how to play the game after that. You're going to have
people step up, but it's definitely not the same cast we had the
entire playoff series.''
</P>
<P>
   The change also meant midfield stopper Danny Pena had to drift
back more than he anticipated. But more than anything, it was a
shock to the backline to lose a player of Fraser's caliber so early
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big part of our back and it was tough to lose him,''
Pena said. ``In a game like this, you can't lose focus, but when
you lose your captain five minutes into the game, obviously, that
takes some steam out of you.''

CSUN SPORTS NOTEBOOK: FRESHMAN CATCHES COACH'S EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A quick glance at the box score indicated nothing
special about Craig Calloway's debut for the Cal State Northridge
men's basketball team against USC last week.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway, a freshman point guard, made a 3-pointer, had one
assist, one turnover and one foul in just seven minutes. But he
impressed CSUN head coach Bobby Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with Craig,'' Braswell said. ``He's
struggled a little bit in practice. But he came in . . . and got us
in our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 Calloway was an All-Moore League selection at Long
Beach's Jordan High last season. That's no small feat; the league
is considered one of the best in the state.
</P>
<P>
   So a five-point debut, in a 73-59 loss to the Trojans, wasn't
too bad for Calloway. That doesn't bode well for Markus Carr, the
Matadors' starting point guard who had five turnovers and was just
1 of 7 from the field in the opener. Carr, a sophomore from
Palmdale, did have a team-high four assists, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (0-1) don't play again until Saturday, when they
open their home season against Cal State Dominguez Hills at Matador
Gym.
</P>
<P>
   __ No hard feelings: Junior guard Edniesha Curry scored a
game-high 25 points in CSUN's women's basketball 69-62 win over
Pepperdine on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, despite being an All-Golden League selection at Palmdale
in 1996-97, wasn't recruited by Pepperdine. She said she doesn't
mind being snubbed by the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't hold any personal grudges,'' Curry said. ``I
just go out there and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   __ She's fast: The women's swimming team has been given a boost
by junior transfer Lisa Andrade, who broke the school record in the
200 breaststroke in her second meet as a Matador.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade was third overall in 2 minutes, 18.49 seconds at the
Southern California Invitational on Oct. 29-30. She was 1.3 seconds
faster than Tina Schnare's time of 2:19.79, set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade wasn't as fast in the same event Saturday against
Pepperdine, but she won in 2:19.37 and the Matadors beat the Waves
in Malibu 159-158.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's Katie Cartnell won two events Saturday: the 500 freestyle
(5:06.90) and 1,000 freestyle (10:27.40); the Matadors' Nicole
Benson won the 200 backstroke in 2:10.20.
</P>
<P>
   __ No luck: The baseball program, boosted by the news it will be
joining the Big West in 2001, almost landed one of the state's top
recruits: Clovis High shortstop Chris Patrick, who signed with
Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was a finalist for Patrick, whose older brother Kevin was
the Matadors' second baseman last year. Kevin Patrick is now a
graduate assistant coach at Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fixing the floor: The Matador Gym basketball court was
stripped, cleaned and polished just two days prior to the women's
game against Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   The floor had to be cleaned after a company hired to do work on
the roof of the kinesiology building, which houses the gym, left
the court a blackened mess.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for cleaning the court is undetermined. Mark Adamiak,
CSUN's assistant events manager, was relieved the floor was
refinished before the season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a window of 55 hours,'' Adamiak said. ``It takes 36
hours. We barely got it done.''

OFF THE WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who wants to be a MULTImillionaire?
</P>
<P>
   If that's the American dream, then Phoenix Coyotes goaltender
Nikolai Khabibulin can live it like not many others who were born
in Syderlovsk, a city _ that we can't even find on a map anymore _
that once existed in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Then why did Khabibulin just reject a three-year, $9 million
deal offered by team general manager Bobby Smith? Khabibulin,
starting his sixth NHL season, said he was offended by the lack of
respect the team showed him with that deal.
</P>
<P>
   And that apparently offended Bob Miller, the Kings' play-by-play
man on Fox Sports Net telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, let him go back to Russia and see what respect he
gets,'' Miller said when he brought up the contract dispute during
Thursday's telecast against the Coyotes. ``It won't be nine million
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jim Fox was, like many viewers, somewhat stunned that
Miller's opinion was offered up so forcefully during a telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong believer in the American system, supply and
demand,'' said Fox, the Canadian-born former Kings star. ``He has
that right (to test the market).''
</P>
<P>
   Answered Miller: ``If you don't like $9 million here, go get it
in Moscow . . . stand in line for sausage and cabbage every day and
see how you like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Offsides on Miller? Is he pulling a Chick Hearn before our ears?
</P>
<P>
   That might be the PC reaction. Just think about if the contract
situation was Rumun Ndur, the first Nigerian player who recently
held out with the New York Rangers before signing. Or Owen Nolan,
the Belfast, Ireland-born star who also held out with Phoenix. How
would Miller have equated their disputes with the dreaded
situations in their native homelands without making it sound like a
cultural slur?
</P>
<P>
   Asked about it the next day, all Miller could say was that the
more he thought about it, in the context of the conversation, with
Khabibulin's quick NHL success and the fact so many athletes these
days come to the U.S. from abroad and adopt this twisted value
system where money is equated with respect, the more he wouldn't
take it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just irks me when I hear people who have that opportunity
claim they get no respect,'' said Miller, in his 27th season with
the Kings. ``It bugs me when someone is given this kind of
lifestyle doesn't appreciate it. I have no sympathy for guys who
think it's a one-way street.
</P>

RED-LIGHT RUNNERS REAP TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Watch the arrow,'' Officer Tim Gaffney said, waiting on his
motorcycle at the corner of McKellips and Gilbert roads in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The left-turn arrow went from green to yellow and red. One, two,
three cars made the turn on red. Gaffney bounced off the curb and
sped down McKellips, lights flashing, in pursuit of the third car.
</P>
<P>
   The $105 ticket Gaffney wrote the driver was one of hundreds of
citations for red-light violations handed out in Phoenix and Mesa
since August as the cities crack down on red-light runners.
</P>
<P>
   The special enforcement effort continues into January and is
funded by grants from the Governor's Office of Highway Safety _
$150,000 to Phoenix and $50,000 in Mesa. Tucson also received
$50,000 for a similar crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   It is money well-spent. Phoenix leads the nation in red-light
accidents with about 3,000 a year, according to the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety. Mesa, despite its use of red-light
cameras at some intersections, was third in the country and Tucson
was fourth. Phoenix is considering the use of red-light cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The funds pay to post officers at about 50 intersections in
Phoenix and 15 in Mesa during the morning and evening rush hours,
and the pickings are easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can easily write eight to 15 tickets in a two-hour period,''
Gaffney said. And that's just him.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty-corner across the intersection, Officer Tim Lafferty was
waiting in a marked patrol car, citation book at the ready. His
first catch of the day was a man who indignantly demanded to know
why Lafferty wasn't out chasing ``the real criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The real criminals do their own damage, but running a red isn't
exactly a victimless crime. Nationally, about 750 people are killed
annually in red-light accidents, about 25 in the Phoenix area,
according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not targeting any particular group,'' Gaffney said.
``We've done school buses, old people, young people.``
</P>
<P>
   He says the red-light problem ``is a perception thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people think if they are in the crosswalk,
they're committed'' to continuing through the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The crosswalk doesn't count. The deciding point is the
invisible line from curb to curb. If you cross that mark when the
light goes yellow, you're just another easy target for Gaffney and
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming up on that yellow light and trying to make it
through, and they're so intent on that that they don't even see us
sitting out here,'' Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half of them admit they're wrong and about half of them
deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that you are late for work or that everyone else
does it isn't going to cut it. The rule, as far as Gaffney and
Lafferty are concerned, is zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have just given me a warning,'' a tearful Chantal
Paris said after Gaffney politely handed her a ticket for failure
to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by getting her first ticket in more than 20 years behind
the wheel, Paris maintained that she had done nothing wrong when
she turned left off Gilbert onto McKellips across the path of an
oncoming van on a decidedly yellow light.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney saw it differently. The van had to slow markedly to
avoid Paris' pickup, which was enough for him to pull her over.
</P>
<P>
   Paris' ticket was just another one on the pile in city courts in
Phoenix and Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Since the special enforcement effort began in Phoenix in August,
officers have written 1,129 moving-violation tickets, including
more than 900 red-light violations, said Sgt. Jeff Halstead, a
police spokesman. And while they were at it, they wrote 1,003
tickets for drivers' other shortcomings, such as no seat belts or
no child-safety seats.
</P>
<P>
   Comparative figures for the months before the crackdown were not
available.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, officers handed out 334 tickets for red-light
violations at 15 intersections in the month of September, police
Sgt. Andy Reinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably a 90 percent increase'' over normal
enforcement levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the effort has been well-publicized in both cities
and even though many of the targeted intersections have signs
warning of the zero-tolerance policy and even though it's kind of
hard to miss a pair of cops sitting at an intersection, there
does't seem to be any ebbing in the flow of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Based on experience with cameras and photo radar at other
intersections, Reinhardt said, it can take a couple of years for
drivers to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's something as simple as red, yellow, green. &QL;

<P>
   Following the team's futile attempt to trade him during the

established that line for Griffey staying put. It does, however,
think a trade is more likely, because the Atlanta Braves have been

MCCAIN TO RE LEASE MEDICAL RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 and CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to defuse an alleged ``whisper campaign'' about
his emotional fitness, Arizona Sen. John McCain said Sunday that he
will release hundreds of pages of medical records.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's &QL; 
campaign said the decision to release the documents was intended to
dispel rumors that he is too unstable to serve as commander in
chief.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On Sunday evening, a second presidential candidate said he
would release his medical records. Steve Forbes told ``The Arizona
Republic'' &UR; that his campaign would make public all of his records
in time for the Iowa GOP caucus in January.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, &QL; 
whose campaign has been surging in New Hampshire and South Carolina
in recent weeks, was asked by television journalist Bob Schieffer
during an appearance on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' Sunday morning
about allegations that his Republican foes are spreading rumors
about his fitness to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race, at least in New Hampshire and now in South Carolina,
is getting closer, and things get tough,'' McCain said. ``But I am
sure the American people will view my passionate advocacy as simply
that. Have I gotten angry? Sure, I get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp in
Vietnam and suffered numerous beatings during his time there, said
he is ``absolutely qualified'' to be president.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain said the candidate is pulling together
the records, which are voluminous because of many injuries
sustained as a pilot and prisoner of war, over the next few days,
but he would not name a date.
</P>
<P>
   The records, which include documents kept both by McCain's Navy
and personal doctors, will put to rest any notion that the senator
is unfit for office, McCain communications director Dan Schnur told
``The Republic'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's been quite a bit of reporting, there's been
quite a bit of coverage of the injuries he suffered in Vietnam, and
he believes it important for the voters to be familiar with his
physical well-being,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Schieffer that he was not personally aware of any
whisper campaign by fellow senators to suggest that his war
experience in Vietnam had left him too emotionally unstable to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   However, the national co-chairman of McCain's campaign has
stated that McCain is a victim of just such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, Washington columnist Mark Shields quoted Sen. Chuck
Hagel, R-Neb., as saying, ``Some powerful individuals do not want
John McCain to be elected president. . . . I will not stand by
while a guy like McCain, a hero who has contributed so much, is
subjected to the lowest, most reprehensible sewer politics and
whisper campaign I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said he had no real evidence of such a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no direct information except hearsay that this kind of
thing is going on,'' McCain told Shieffer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain repeatedly sought to make light of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, Bob, you have to be half-nuts to run for
president,'' McCain said. ``So I accept the charge. I don't know
anything about it. Of course, you hear rumors, you hear things that
are said, you hear quotes in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm sorry this has happened. I have many close and dear
friends in the Senate, and people who I have known and served with
for many years, who I'm sure spring to my defense regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer noted that ``Washington Post'' columnist Elizabeth
Drew on Friday had identified several Senate Republicans, among
them members of the GOP leadership and supporters of Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, who she maintained were spreading the rumors about
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The senators named by Drew have denied they engaged in a whisper
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Shieffer, ``I take them at their word, and there's
no reason for me not to.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth told a reporter Sunday evening that he
thought McCain's gesture to release the records was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful way to defuse it (the temper issue). It is
such a contrast to President Clinton, who never rleased his medical
records,'' Hayworth said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vinay Gunnala, 17, of Phoenix, who wore a McCain T-shirt, said
he did not believe that McCain's temper should be a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is passionate about things, and this is the right way to be
for a president,'' Gunnala said.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidential candidates in town for a debate at Arizona
State University on Sunday said they believe McCain's mental health
is best left to the voters to assess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have to gauge that, and I don't think it's going to
come down to just temper,'' Steve Forbes told ``The Republic.''
``It's going to be about a person's entire character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to release, at some point, the basics on
your health,'' Forbes said, noting that Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy all had physical disabilities
that could have affected their performance in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes agreed that voters, not candidates, must decide
whether McCain's temper is a valid campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the folks who have to handle it,'' he said. ``They
make the judgment to decide whether it is relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision to release his medical records does not give
the issue any added weight, Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone raises questions about your fitness, you do that to
prove that they are mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said the release of his medical records has not been an
issue in his campaign and he has made no decision on whether they
will be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Flint, spokesman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, agreed with
Forbes that voters, not candidates, will decide whether McCain's
sometimes volatile temper makes him unfit to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters decide pretty darn quick if someone is not mentally fit
for the job, and I don't think that is anywhere near the case for
Senator McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint said McCain's passion could be explained by his years as a
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John McCain has a temper,'' Flint said, ``it just sounds
like he is a fighter pilot. People with edgier tempers make good
fighter pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint added that if some GOP senators have launched a whisper
campaign against McCain, the Bush camp could be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Flint added that Hatch would be willing to release his medical
records, ``but no one has asked for them.'' &QL;

<P>
   A caravan of buses carrying hundreds of students back to
Pennsylvania State University after a day in Manhattan collided in
a chain-reaction pileup on a foggy Interstate highway in
northeastern Pennsylvania early Sunday. Two people died and 113
were injured, seven seriously, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the pileup minutes after midnight could not be
immediately determined. But the state police said the crash
occurred in heavy fog on westbound Interstate 80, near White Haven,
Pa., a largely rural stretch south of Wilkes-Barre, about two hours
from the main campus of Penn State at University Park.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses say the first bus may have hit a freeway overpass,
prompting a chain reaction. There were no immediate indications
Sunday of excessive speed or driver impairment, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of six buses carrying 280 passengers, nearly all Penn State
students but also a few parents, were involved in the accident. A
pickup truck and two automobiles were forced off the road by the
pileup, but it was not immediately clear whether passengers from
those vehicles were among the injured.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the second bus in the collision, Robert C. Burge,
50, of Altoona, Pa., was pronounced dead at the scene. Burge, a
former pastor of the Riggles Gap Bible Church in Altoona, Pa., was
an employee of the Blue and White Bus Line in Altoona, which
operated all six buses.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ice, the pastor of the Riggles Gap church, said Burge
had left a year ago after serving the congregation of 200 for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was driving buses to get by,'' Ice said. ``He just felt God
was calling him to a different ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   The other fatality was a Penn State student in the front row of
the third bus, who was also pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Denise R. Orndorff, a 23-year-old biology major
from Ohiopyle, Pa., was with her mother, Linda, who was listed in
satisfactory condition at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce A. Nalesnik, the Carbon County coroner, said autopsies
were scheduled for Ms. Orndorff and Burge.
</P>
<P>
   The injured suffered mainly minor cuts and bruises, and 106 were
treated and released. Seven others re- mained in the hospital,
including six passengers and a bus driver, who had undergone
surgery Sunday and was listed in critical condition, Penn State's
president, Graham Spanier, said at a news conference Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Laura A. Snee, 20, a Penn State junior majoring in American
Studies who was in the bus where the driver died, said she was
asleep when it collided with the first bus, which had stopped or
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the bus in front of us and I got thrown into the seat
in front of me,'' said Ms. Snee, who had sat in the right window
seat in the second row. ``I was just coming to when I heard a woman
say something like, `Oh my gosh,' then two seconds later, the other
bus hit us from behind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Snee was pitched forward into the aisle in the front of the
bus, next to Burge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken out of the bus,'' Ms. Snee said. ``Everything
happened so fast and I had just been asleep. But I saw his face
covered later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee suffered a broken nose and cuts and bruises and was
back at her apartment on campus by Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two buses in the six-bus caravan were not involved
in the accident, and uninjured Penn State students rushed to help,
piling their coats in mounds so the injured could be covered,
providing cell phones so students could call home and applying
makeshift bandages to the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the fog began thickening in New Jersey shortly
after the caravan left Manhattan at about 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee said that while she was waiting in the emergency ward
of the Poconos Medical Center she compared notes with other
students, who said that the buses had slowed because of the fog,
putting them at least a half hour behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The buses were traveling at up to 40 mph, Ms. Snee said. A
student in the third bus in the collision, the one that hit Ms.
Snee's bus, told her that he had been looking through the
windshield and that all he saw was white fog lit up by the
headlights, then a sudden clearing of fog, followed by the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The students were part of a shopping and sightseeing outing
called ``Spend a Day in New York'' that cost $20 and left campus at
4:30 a.m. on Saturday. The 240-mile trip typically takes
four-and-half hours one way, but the caravan arrived in New York
about an hour late because one of the buses had a flat tire. The
students arrived around 10 a.m. and got off near Rockefeller
Center, just south of Saks Fifth Avenue.

`SLEEPY HOLLOW' AND BOND SET BOX OFFICE RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Bond beat the Headless Horseman in a spirited battle at
the nation's multiplexes as ``The World Is Not Enough'' took in an
estimated $37.2 million at 3,163 theaters during the Friday-Sunday
period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the 20th James Bond movie, the best debut in the
37-year-old series, fought off an impressive challenge from the
rollout of ``Sleepy Hollow'' with $30.5 million at 3,064 theaters.
The duo's results represent the first time two openings have topped
the $30 million mark in the same weekend and herald a red-hot
launch for the holiday moviegoing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is incredibly strong demand for good movies right now,''
said industry tracker Arthur Rockwell. ``I'd say the holiday season
is in full swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which has remained a Hollywood player in
recent years due to the Bond franchise, reported 71 percent of
moviegoers polled would recommend ``The World Is Not Enough.'' That
was 6 percent higher than responses for 1997's ``Tomorrow Never
Dies,'' the top domestic grosser in the series with $125.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outperformed our wildest dreams,'' said distribution chief
Larry Gleason. ``This should play well into January.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleason said the results reflected the success of MGM's
targeting of teens and young adults in its marketing campaign,
which featured extensive promotion on MTV and the casting of Denise
Richards as a nuclear physicist. MGM, which also opened the film on
Friday in Singapore and Malaysia, is hoping to eclipse the
worldwide record of $351 million for a Bond movie, set in 1995 by
``Goldeneye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' marks the third Bond film starring
Pierce Brosnan, the fifth actor to play the 007 role. ``Brosnan has
done a good job of growing into the role,'' said Rockwell, a former
MGM executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the Bond franchise is split between MGM and
producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source tracking service, credited the studio
and producers with adept handling of the latest Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had to keep reinventing the wheel, but the character
can go into so many different situations,'' Bucksbaum added. ``This
franchise is never going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``The World Is Not Enough'' dominated business in
Middle America while ``Sleepy Hollow'' posted its strongest numbers
in major metropolitan areas. He said the latter, starring Johnny
Depp as Ichabod Crane in a revamped version of the Washington
Irving tale, benefited from Paramount's well-executed marketing
campaign and moviegoers' seemingly unending appetite for
horror-suspense films.
</P>
<P>
   ``That genre just is not quitting,'' he added. ``I think it's
the most surprising trend of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow,'' which cost a reported $70 million, received
fairly positive reviews while critics were mixed on ``The World Is
Not Enough.'' But Bond films have tended to be ``review-proof'' in
attracting customers.
</P>
<P>
   The strong performance of the top two movies sets up a major
collision at the box office on Wednesday when Universal opens
Arnold Schwarzenegger's action-thriller ``End of Days'' and Disney
expands its much-anticipated ``Toy Story 2'' from its current
one-screen run. The sequel generated an impressive $310,000 over
the weekend at the El Capitan theater in Hollywood and will go into
over 3,200 locations in two more days.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are knocking on our doors saying please send us this
movie,'' said distribution chief Chuck Viane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' and ``Sleepy Hollow'' accounted for
nearly three of every five tickets purchased, stealing momentum
from most holdover films which sustained losses of at least 40
percent of their take from the previous weekend. The previous
winner, Warner Bros.' ``Pokemon: The First Movie,'' suffered a 57
percent decline from its astounding opening as the kiddie sensation
finished third with $13.3 million at 3,043 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``The Bone Collector'' dropped 46
percent to $6.5 million at 2,623 locations for fourth place and
Lions Gate's second weekend of ``Dogma'' followed with $4.1 million
at 1,323 screens as the offbeat comedy plunged 53 percent. 20th
Century Fox's second weekend of ``Anywhere But Here'' lost 40
percent with $3.3 million at 1,681 sites and Disney's third weekend
of ``The Insider'' declined 42 percent to $2.9 million at 1,884
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of ``The Messenger _ The Story of Joan of
Arc'' took a massive hit as it fell 60 percent and finished eighth
with a tepid $2.5 million at 2,147 theaters. New Line's third
weekend of ``The Bachelor'' dropped 49 percent to $2.4 million at
2,337 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   USA Films' fourth weekend of ``Being John Malkovich'' came in
10th with $1.9 million at only 590 theaters, edging Warner's fourth
weekend of ``The House on Haunted Hill'' and Disney's 16th weekend
of ``The Sixth Sense,'' each with $1.7 million. It was the first
time that ``The Sixth Sense,'' which has topped $270 million
overall, has finished outside the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of limited releases generated strong numbers as Miramax's
romance ``Mansfield Park'' took in $87,000 at eight theaters and
Warner's ensemble comedy ``Liberty Heights'' garnered $95,000 at
four screens.
</P>
<P>
   Overall weekend business totaled about $121 million, up 14
percent from the same weekend a year ago when ``Rugrats'' led with
$27.3 million. Year-to-date business neared the $6.4 billion mark,
about 8 percent ahead of last year.

LAUSD CRACKING DOWN ON COUNTERFEITING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Thousands of dollars in counterfeit currency has
been spent at Los Angeles Unified school cafeterias and bookstores,
prompting the district's top investigator to team with the U.S.
Secret Service to find the bogus money makers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, fake $20, $10 and $5 bills have been showing
up regularly in schools, and most cashiers aren't trained to spot
the bogus bills, said Don Mullinax, director of the LAUSD Internal
Audits and Special Investigations Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy way to launder money,'' Mullinax said. ``A
student uses a fake $20 bill to buy a candy bar and comes away with
$19 that are clean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can then use that real money on the street. The district
ends up taking the loss when we try to deposit the fake money at a
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second-largest school district has no estimate of
how much phony money has been circulated at its campuses, but
Mullinax and federal agents said there are probably thousands of
counterfeit bills changing hands around schools.
</P>
<P>
   With a proliferation of relatively inexpensive, high-quality
color copiers and printers, the investigators believe enterprising
students have used home computer systems to print illegal loot.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secret Service agents in Los Angeles seize about $80,000 a
week in counterfeit money from the streets of Los Angeles, some 70
percent of which is computer generated _ as opposed to produced on
an offset printing press, the more traditional process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterfeiting is not something that anyone should be playing
with,'' said Tony Meeks, chief deputy assistant to the special
agent in charge of the U.S. Secret Service's Los Angeles office.
``You can't print your own bills to use as funny money. You can't
do it for kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Juveniles busted for pawning off counterfeit currency as the
real thing face stiff fines and possible jail sentences, depending
upon the amount of fake money being distributed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, if not every case, the Secret Service will
confiscate the technology used by the juvenile to counterfeit the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if the kid owns it or the parents own it,''
Meeks warned. ``We will take the equipment. You will lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mullinax's request, Secret Service agents, who have the
responsibility for investigating counterfeiting, will launch a
campaign to teach the district's financial managers,
administrators, teachers and students how to spot the phony money.
The first seminar will be held Wednesday at Eagle Rock High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real proactive step, because we have no idea how
much counterfeit currency is in the school district,'' Mullinax
said. ``We have not found tons and tons of counterfeit currency,
but we have seen a consistent amount of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know we are looking at this,'' he said.
``Don't even think about bringing counterfeit money into our
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way for an average person to detect a counterfeit bill
is to compare a suspect bill to a genuine bill, Meeks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So few of our citizens really know their money. So many people
can't tell a counterfeit from a genuine bill,'' said Meeks, a
17-year law enforcement veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the school district at least initially to teach
people how to detect the counterfeits. Particularly with our new
style of currency, it's important to familiarize yourself with
what's on our money,'' he said. ``Education is one of our best
assets in combating counterfeiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Genuine bills usually have a crisper texture because of the
high-cotton-content paper used by the U.S. Treasury, officials
said. The real money also will have a straight, thin security
stripe running from top to bottom of the bill, just left of the
portrait. The stripe is visible when the bill is held up to the
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets easier every day to counterfeit money with the new
improvements in computer technology,'' Meeks explained. ``These
kids are smart enough to know how to use the computers. You'll
catch them, and they say they were just playing around.''

BUCKS IN BADGE? POLICE MIGHT BILL STUDIOS FOR USING LAPD EMBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- To protect and to serve _ and profit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you cherish or dislike the Los Angeles Police
Department, officials believe the global reputation of L.A's Finest
is worth millions _ and a new business venture: trademarking the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   If policy makers approve this unique proposal, film and
television productions using the LAPD's emblems _ such as badges,
logos, patches and the department seal _ will be shelling out cash
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And retailers selling LAPD hats, shirts, coffee mugs and model
squad cars also would pay a license fee or face being sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great commercial benefit for the LAPD and the city,
and through royalties we stand to do reasonably well,'' said Los
Angeles Police Commissioner Dean Hansell, who launched the
campaign. ``The Police Department and taxpayers would greatly
benefit from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys working pro bono for the LAPD already have filed the
paperwork with the federal government. The revenue would be put
into a special fund, controlled by the Los Angeles Police
Commission, for police equipment, training and community programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds would be used to purchase things for the LAPD that
aren't in the budget or that would take years to get approval
for,'' LAPD Deputy Chief Dave Gascon said. ``I see a major benefit
_ to upgrade department computers and technology and to fund
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have no fear the move would degrade the LAPD by
creating the notion its image is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for profit. We're looking to make our money
go further to provide service,'' Hansell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not businessmen; we are law enforcement officers,''
Gascon said. ``But when we can get into an entrepreneurial
situation where officers and taxpayers benefit by enhanced
services, everyone wins.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Police Commission approves the plan, the LAPD would be
the only large U.S. police agency to have all its symbols
trademarked. Trademarking brings in about $2million a year for the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Hansell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Police Department is the only major city police
agency in the United States to own a trademark, and that is only
for its badge, Dallas police Sgt. Jim Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD would not do the licensing itself. A licensing and
marketing agent would be hired for a percentage of the royalty fees
_ not any city salary or fringe benefits, Hansell said.
</P>
<P>
   Trademark attorney Rami Yanni of the law firm of Graham and
James said there is no immediate estimate of how much studios and
others would pay for a license to use LAPD-trademarked emblems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would depend greatly on how much they would use it or how
prominently it would be displayed in a project. It's really
unquantifiable right now,'' said Yanni, who is handling the federal
registration for the LAPD. ``There is no industry standard.
Realistically, they could charge what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying royalties probably would not deter productions based on
the LAPD, according to officials at Warner Bros., which distributed
the LAPD-based films ``L.A. Confidential'' and ``Heat''; Sony
pictures, which distributed ``Blue Streak''; and New Line Cinema,
now producing ``Magnolia,'' a film featuring an LAPD officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to look at the situation, but I really can't see
it being a big problem,'' said New Line spokesman Steve Elser.
</P>
<P>
   Gascon also believes the move would not upset the LAPD's
relationship with the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very closely with them, giving them technical advice
to help support realism,'' Gascon said. ``This will continue to be
mutually beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers selling items like LAPD coffee mugs and hats would
have to sign a license agreement to share profits with the
department. An average royalty on retail items ranges from 5
percent to 10 percent of the wholesale price, Yanni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would even open the doors for creating an LAPD product
store,'' Yanni said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also could refuse to license products when they
considered use of the LAPD emblem inappropriate. Trademarking
symbols would not, however, give the LAPD editorial control over
controversial films or books mentioning the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's protected by the First Amendment,'' Gascon said. ``We
just realize that the LAPD, despite our problems, is popular
worldwide, and we have the best of images throughout the world, and
we should benefit from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to vote on the issue later this
month, Hansell said.

is obvious to the 20 million people who enter the park every year,

comprehensive Internet deregulation bill, the Internet Tax Freedom
Act, says most of the Internet legislation pending in the 106th
Congress was premature. ``Government simply doesn't have the answer

   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- CENTRALPARK-TRANSFORM, 11-21 -- By passing
the hat among its neighbors, who happen to be America's most
densely packed bunch of rich people, Central Park has harvested the
largest haul of private dollars ever raised for a public park. As
is obvious to the 20 million people who enter the park every year,
this bumper crop of philanthropy, $233 million so far, has done a
world of good. The graffiti-smeared ruin that was an international
embarrassment two decades ago has been reborn as a meticulously
restored greensward where bronze-preservation specialists each year
polish and wax all 50 of the park's statues. (Nicole Bengiveno/New

Russian soldiers now patrol the streets of Gudermes, Chechnya's
bleak but strategically important second largest city. As the
Russian army closes in on Chechnya's besieged capital, Grozny, it
is using a fresh strategy: promising Chechens that their bedraggled
towns will be spared a relentless bombardment if they surrender to
Russian forces, then attempting to secure loyalty by restoring
services like gas and electricity. (Michael R. Gordon/New York

weekday. Though foreign aid workers give food and other help to
Kosovo's people, most of the energy comes from the Albanians
themselves, with access to money of their own or of relatives
abroad, and not from international efforts. Five months after NATO
forces moved in to take absolute control of Kosovo, there is little
electricity and an inconstant water supply, the streets are full of
garbage, traffic is in chaos, and no one has new identity papers.

 WEB SITES LURE USERS WITH CHANCE TO WIN CASH  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Berkeley resident Tom Church isn't among the
one-third of Americans who believe that hitting a jackpot is their
best chance at wealth. But when he saw a Web site giving away
$10,000 a day, he thought, ``It's free, so what the heck?''
</P>
<P>
   He entered iWon.com's sweepstakes on a Friday last month. That
Monday, he received an e-mail informing him that he was among the
CBS-backed company's early $10,000 winners.
</P>
<P>
   IWon.com is a portal with Web search, e-mail and other
functions, much like Yahoo, Lycos, AltaVista and other portals.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the others, this Web site gives away $10,000 every
day, $1 million once a month, and plans to give $10 million to one
winner on Tax Day, April 17, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Church entered during iWon.com's first week, when the site only
got an average of 27,000 visitors a day, so his chances of winning
were better than they are for those playing iWon.com today. By the
second week of November, an average of 350,000 people were visiting
iWon.com daily, according to Media Metrix, an Internet rating firm.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet sweepstakes offer odds that are similar or better
than the odds of winning the California Lottery _ but the Web sites
are all free. So what's in it for them?
</P>
<P>
   For iWon, giving away bulging handfuls of cash is a tactic to
win Internet users' attention in a portal market crowded with
more-established brands. Once the firm becomes a major player,
executives plan to make money just like Yahoo does _ through
advertising, sponsorship and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, we expect the bulk of our revenues to be
generated through advertising and sponsorship,'' said Jon Brod,
iWon vice president of marketing. ``With the exponential growth of
e-commerce, we expect iWon shopping, and its network of 450
affiliated merchants, to be a more significant contributor in the
longer term.''
</P>
<P>
   LuckySurf.com and TreeLoot, two other online sweepstakes,
concentrate on driving players to advertisers' Web sites. Launched
September 1, LuckySurf.com promises to give $1 million to anyone
who can match seven out of seven numbers in its daily drawing. So
far, the closest anyone has come is six numbers, for a $1,000
prize.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: In order to validate an entry, a player must click a
banner and visit an advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing our members into the advertiser's store instead
of having them just window-shop,'' said co-founder and CEO Daniel
J. Laury. ``Our advertisers have been very happy so far.'' Clients
have reported to LuckySurf.com that the conversion rate, or the
number of visitors who register or make a purchase, seems to be the
same for ``forced clicks'' as it is for those who voluntarily click
on banners.
</P>
<P>
   If the player actually buys something on the Web site that
LuckySurf.com sent her or him to, LuckySurf.com gets a cut of the
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Laury's partner, Pierre M. Achach, said that future revenue
possibilities include syndicating the game to other Web sites, or
perhaps partnering with a portal to give iWon.com a run for its
money.
</P>
<P>
   One online giveaway that's actually making a profit is TreeLoot,
a site that rewards visitors who find money hidden in a graphic of
a tree. Its banner ad shows a moving monkey and challenges viewers
to ``Catch the monkey and win $20.'' The Kansas City company's
president, 19-year-old Scott Lynn, says that his site started
making money three months after he founded it in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to exceed $10 million in gross revenue next year. We
have no venture capital. We don't even have a bank loan,'' said
Lynn. His site was listed 59th in popularity among all Web sites by
Nielsen/NetRatings in October. Its banner ad, which shows a moving
monkey and challenges viewers to ``Punch the monkey and win $20,''
was the 14th most-viewed ad on the entire Internet during the same
month.
</P>
<P>
   Both LuckySurf.com and TreeLoot conduct surveys to find out more
about their customers; the results of the surveys are then used to
sell targeted advertising. TreeLoot doles out hints on prize
location to players who fill out a detailed questionnaire
indicating Internet use, buying habits and income. Visiting enough
sponsors can land the player the chance to play in a special bonus
round.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn paid the prizes, ranging from $20 to more than $1,000, out
of his own pocket until the advertising revenue started rolling in.
Now the site offers a $25,000 grand prize, but no one has won it
yet, probably because players have to click two points,
consecutively and in the right order, to get the jackpot. There are
170,000 points on the tree to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   In the chat room hosted by TreeLoot, the consensus among players
is that the big prizes are all but impossible to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play but I don't know why,'' complained a player who goes by
the screen name Strongbow. ``They just want you to visit their
sponsors and make them money.''
</P>
<P>
   With new sweepstakes sites appearing every week, Henry Blodget,
a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch, says that the field will soon be
so crowded that the prizes may have to get even bigger to garner
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will put pressure on the business model,'' Blodget said.
``As long as you make more money than you give away, there's
nothing wrong with this business model. But very few of them will
work because there will be so much competition that they will have
a hard time making enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they don't charge money to play, the people behind these
sites believe they're operating within the law. Sweepstakes are
legal in California, and in most of the United States, as long as
they don't require the player to make a purchase, pay a fee, or
provide anything else of value. Florida initially refused to
register sweepstakes that could only be entered online, but has
since reversed its position.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the information players provide through registration
forms and surveys is worth plenty to marketers. Sandra Michioku, a
spokesperson for the California attorney general, said that she did
not believe these things constitute ``consideration,'' or payment.
</P>
<P>
   That idea is due for re-examination, according to John P.
Feldman, a lawyer for Arent Fox, a Washington, D.C., law firm that
maintains a cyberspace law practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't assume that simply because a person doesn't pay
money that they aren't giving up valuable consideration,'' Feldman
said. ``What's going on here is that the law has not caught up with
the plethora of offerings on the Internet.'' Arent Fox gets at
least two calls a day from clients who want to start new online
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On the Internet) some of the most important consumer dynamics
are in relationship building. Owning the customer's attention and
online experience _ that type of interactivity _ is worth a
tremendous amount to an online company,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent Internet giveaway sites are scrupulous in
following sweepstakes laws, and go out of their way to show that
they are legitimate. They post the odds of winning, and they engage
independent auditors to conduct drawings. Some allow mail-in
entries as an alternative to visiting the Web site. They post
winners' first names and photos. TreeLoot even shows scanned images
of canceled prize checks.
</P>
<P>
   These Web sites promise the opportunity to win anywhere from $20
to $1 million every day. Their methods of producing the cash vary.
</P>
<P>
   LuckySurf.com holds an insurance policy with Lloyd's of London.
If a player is lucky enough to guess all seven numbers, Lloyd's
comes up with the million bucks. LuckySurf.com pays a premium that
increases with player volume.
</P>
<P>
   IWon benefits from the deep pockets of CBS and other backers who
have faith in the idea. Co-founders Jonas Steinman, then a general
partner at Chase Capital Partners, and Bill Daugherty, who was
senior vice president of business development for the National
Basketball Association, felt that the portal was a great business
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were almost starting to get commoditized,'' Steinman
said. So the two friends threw in the cash incentive to set their
portal apart from the pack and create ``the ultimate loyalty
program.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is the last network to have its own portal; ABC has the Go
Network and NBC has Snap.com. CBS Vice President of Communications
Dana McClintock said the investment is about extending CBS's brand
and content onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not venture capitalists,'' McClintock said. While CBS
hasn't stamped its name on iWon.com's front door, he said, ``We
feel it has the possibility of being the CBS portal and aggregating
our sites down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Laury sees LuckySurf.com as an improvement on existing reward
programs, like AllAdvantage.com, which pay users up to $1 an hour
to surf the Net while viewing targeted banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to spend a tremendous amount of time to be able to
get a little bit of money,'' Laury said. ``We are on the opposite
end. You spend very little time on our site'' _ he estimates it
takes 25 seconds a day to enter seven numbers and submit the entry
_ ``and you have the chance to win a huge sum of money.''
</P>
<P>
   At iWon.com, on the other hand, the chance of winning increases
if the user spends more time exploring the site. Clicking on a CBS
news story might earn the user seven entries in the daily, monthly
and annual drawings, while personalizing the page earns more
entries. However, there is a daily limit of 100 entries.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Snyder, who plays during downtime at work, said that she
can collect 100 entries in about two minutes. ``There's really no
reason to stay longer than that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after winning $10,000 at iWon.com, Church says he doesn't
use the site as his main Internet navigation tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I click a few things to get my entries, and then I go back to
Yahoo,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ---------------------------------JACKPOT SITES &QL; 
 &QL; 
iWon.com: CBS-backed portal offers typical features _ Inktomi
Internet search, news, weather, free e-mail _ plus one major bonus:
drawings for $10,000 daily, $1 million monthly and $10 million on
Tax Day. The more a visitor uses the site, the more drawing entries
she amasses. CBS put up $70 million in free TV ads, plus an

 &LR; h,76p3,36,eb  &LR; FDA Panel's Rejection of AIDS Drug Could End Free
Treatments
</P>
<P>
   &LR; k,11p10,18  &LR; Gilead Sciences &QL; 
under pressure &QL; 
to continue giveaway
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rt,11p10 wrapper reset,12p2,13.2i i  &LR; A few weeks ago, lukewarm
support from AIDS activists helped torpedo a drug application from
Gilead Sciences of Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   Now those same activists, who thought Adefovir had too many side
effects, wonder whether Gilead will continue to give away free
doses of the experimental therapy that was rejected by a U.S. Food
and Drug Administration advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  The advisory panel's rejection of Adefovir shaved 25 percent off
Gilead's share price, since investors can now assume the drug won't
win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Nevertheless, AIDS activists are putting subtle pressure on
Gilead to continue a program that has given the drug away to 10,000
of the sickest AIDS patients, people who have exhausted other
treatment options and were taking Adefovir as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaway, which has cost Gilead $10 million during the past
two years, was not entirely altruistic.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists have ``persuaded'' many drugmakers to fund such
programs, and companies have considered this a cost of business,
giving them a larger pool of test subjects and helping build a
constituency when seeking FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gilead discovered, such corporate generosity offered no
guarantee of support from AIDS activists.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether the company will continue giving
away a drug that the FDA advisory committee decided wasn't good
enough to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made that decision yet,'' said Gilead Chief
Financial Officer Mark Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Before it does anything, Gilead wants to hear the FDA's final
verdict on Adefovir.
</P>
<P>
   In one likely scenario, the agency would urge Gilead to do more
safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilead might decide to quit all research on Adefovir and
divert some $26 million in R&AMP;D earmarked for that drug toward
development of a safer, more potent AIDS treatment called
Tenofovir.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead is poised to begin Phase III clinical trials of
Tenofovir. Even if those tests go well, it could be a couple of
years before that drug gets approved.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BIOSCOPE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Gilead had hoped to win sales in the interim from Adefovir,
before it stumbled on the last rung of the FDA approval ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Such corporate strategy considerations will influence, but not
determine, the future of the Adefovir giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said Gilead has enough Adefovir on hand to continue
providing the free drug to the roughly 4,500 patients currently &LR; 
 &LR; taking it, assuming that they remain enrolled for nine months _
the length of time most people stay with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher decision will be whether Gilead continues to accept
new applicants who have been applying to get Adefovir at the rate
of 50 to 100 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said Gilead's costs are front-loaded. The company pays
$1,500 to enroll each new  &LR; patient in the program and incurs only
incidental expenses thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that we will be under pressure from the FDA and
activist groups to continue,'' Perry said, adding that the company
will have to ask ``whether it makes sense from a corporate point of
view to invest in a drug that might not result in a product.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AIDS activists watch and wait. ``We're all just
waiting for Gilead to provide some guidance,'' said Martin Delaney
with Project Inform in San Francisco.

beds, a pair of black Nike sneakers _ offered a hint of their
macabre origins. The items auctioned by county officials Saturday

 FDA PANEL'S REJECTION OF AIDS DRUG COULD END FREE TREATMENTS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A few weeks ago, lukewarm support from AIDS
activists helped torpedo a drug application from Gilead Sciences of
Foster City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Now those same activists, who thought Adefovir had too many side
effects, wonder whether Gilead will continue to give away free
doses of the experimental therapy that was rejected by a U.S. Food
and Drug Administration advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel's rejection of Adefovir shaved 25 percent off
Gilead's share price, since investors can now assume the drug won't
win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, AIDS activists are putting subtle pressure on
Gilead to continue a program that has given the drug away to 10,000
of the sickest AIDS patients, people who have exhausted other
treatment options and were taking Adefovir as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaway, which has cost Gilead $10 million during the past
two years, was not entirely altruistic.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists have ``persuaded'' many drugmakers to fund such
programs, and companies have considered this a cost of business,
giving them a larger pool of test subjects and helping build a
constituency when seeking FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gilead discovered, such corporate generosity offered no
guarantee of support from AIDS activists.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether the company will continue giving
away a drug that the FDA advisory committee decided wasn't good
enough to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made that decision yet,'' said Gilead Chief
Financial Officer Mark Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Before it does anything, Gilead wants to hear the FDA's final
verdict on Adefovir.
</P>
<P>
   In one likely scenario, the agency would urge Gilead to do more
safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilead might decide to quit all research on Adefovir and
divert some $26 million in R&AMP;D earmarked for that drug toward
development of a safer, more potent AIDS treatment called
Tenofovir.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead is poised to begin Phase III clinical trials of
Tenofovir. Even if those tests go well, it could be a couple of
years before that drug gets approved.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead had hoped to win sales in the interim from Adefovir,
before it stumbled on the last rung of the FDA approval ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Such corporate strategy considerations will influence, but not
determine, the future of the Adefovir giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said Gilead has enough Adefovir on hand to continue
providing the free drug to the roughly 4,500 patients taking it,
assuming that they remain enrolled for nine months _ the length of
time most people stay with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher decision will be whether Gilead continues to accept
new applicants who have been applying to get Adefovir at the rate
of 50 to 100 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said Gilead's costs are front-loaded. The company pays
$1,500 to enroll each new  &LR; patient in the program and incurs only
incidental expenses thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that we will be under pressure from the FDA and
activist groups to continue,'' Perry said, adding that the company
will have to ask ``whether it makes sense from a corporate point of
view to invest in a drug that might not result in a product.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AIDS activists watch and wait. ``We're all just
waiting for Gilead to provide some guidance,'' said Martin Delaney
with Project Inform in San Francisco.

 INSIDER TRADES ARE EASY TO FIND ON THE INTERNET  &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Would you buy shares in a company if you knew
the CEO had just dumped all of his or her stock? Not me. I prefer a
firm whose officers are loading up, instead of selling their
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   High-level executives usually know when sales are exceeding
expectations, or if development of that important new widget is
lagging behind schedule. They are insiders, and this is inside
information. It's legal for insiders to buy or sell their company's
stock based on this kind of information _ as long as they follow
the rules. One of those rules is that they have to report their
trades to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Once reported, the information is public knowledge, and these
days anything public finds its way onto the Web. Insider trading
information is available, in different formats, on a variety of
sites. I'll show you two of my favorites.
</P>
<P>
   I picked three companies to use as examples: Russell Corp., an
athletic apparel-maker in Alabama; Conseco Inc., an insurance
company based in Carmel, Ind.; and Verity Inc., a Silicon Valley
software company.
</P>
<P>
   Market Guide (www.marketguide.com) offers a quick way to look at
insider trading: a simple tabulation of purchases and sales.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with Russell. Type Russell's ticker symbol (RML)
into the Search For box on the left, near the top of Market Guide's
home page. You can enter the company name if you don't know the
symbol; just be sure to select Name above the entry box.
</P>
<P>
   From the Snapshot view, click on Performance on the menu on the
left, and scroll past Price Performance to Insider Trading. Market
Guide tells us how many buy and sell transactions took place in the
past six months, and the number of shares traded. When I looked
last week (week of November 15), Market Guide showed 12 insider
buys and zero sells. Insiders purchased 12,000 shares collectively,
or 1,000 each on average.
</P>
<P>
   Stay on the Performance page and type Conseco's ticker symbol,
CNC, into the Search For box. When I did, I saw 16 insider buys and
no sells, not much different from Russell. But here is what was
different: The purchases totaled 3.088 million shares. I used my
calculator to figure out that the 16 insiders, on average, bought
193,000 shares each. That is serious buying.
</P>
<P>
   Next, use ticker symbol VRTY to display the insider trading
history for Verity. Here is a different story. There were nine
insider sales totaling 272,000 shares, and no purchases. That means
nine insiders, on average, sold 30,222 shares each.
</P>
<P>
   These are interesting facts, but I wouldn't act on the
information before looking at the insider trading in more detail.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out exactly who sold what on Market Guide by
selecting Insider Trading from the menu on the left. However, I
prefer Quicken (www.quicken.com).
</P>
<P>
   Quicken shows you more detail about each trade and lists more
trading history than Market Guide.
</P>
<P>
   We'll look at Russell first by typing its symbol into the Get
Quotes &AMP; Research box near the top righthand corner on Quicken's
home page, and then selecting Insider Trading from the menu on the
left.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken shows all reported insider trades going back 13 months.
We can see the name and title of each insider making a trade, the
trade date, action (type of trade), number of shares, the trade
share price and more.
</P>
<P>
   The Action column shows whether the stock was bought or sold on
the open market or acquired by exercising a stock option.
</P>
<P>
   Another entry you'll often see in the Action column is Planned
Sale, a notice of intent to sell required by the SEC under certain
conditions. The planned sale notice by itself is not a trade.
Sometimes the insider doesn't end up selling any or all of the
shares specified.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to Russell, you see that quite a few insiders
bought relatively small numbers of shares on the open market in
recent months. You can hone in on the transactions for each insider
by clicking on individual names.
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably notice inconsistencies in names and titles
because the information comes from reports filed with the SEC.
Sometimes the same person will list a different title on different
reports, for instance, ``chief executive officer'' on one report,
and simply ``officer'' on another. He may use his full name one
time and initials another time.
</P>
<P>
   Let's move on to Conseco by typing its ticker symbol into the
Symbol(s) box above the insider trades list. Here's a surprise! I
expected most of the trades would be exercises of options at a
fraction of the current share price. Instead, officers and
directors are buying hundreds of thousands of shares at current
market prices. Many of the trades amounted to several million
dollars. There's a message here, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let's look at Verity. When I looked, the first 11
entries were planned sale notices, most for substantial amounts, by
officers and directors. But don't jump to conclusions. Maybe they
are planning to sell shares they will be receiving by exercising
options. It is common practice, especially in technology companies,
to reward employees with lucrative stock options, sometimes in lieu
of higher salaries. The employees may consider the options part of
their salary, and as a matter of course, sell the stock the same
day they exercise the option.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what you'll see if you scan down past the planned
sale notices: a series of sales and exercises, on the same date,
and for the same number of shares. I think you'll find it
interesting to compare the option exercise price to the
corresponding sale price.
</P>
<P>
   What conclusions can we draw from our insider trading analysis
of Russell, Conseco, and Verity?
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russell's insider buying is penny ante. I don't know
what to make of a company whose CEO only owns 2,000 shares.
Verity's insider trading is innocuous; it's all related to the
exercise of options and is not significant. As for Conseco . . .
excuse me while I call my broker.
