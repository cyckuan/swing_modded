Clinton was replying a question that if NATO would launch
strikes once Milosevic fails to sign the accord while the Kosovar
Albanians make an endorsement of that.

<HEADLINE> Berger Says Kosovar Albanians Ready to Sign Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that the chairman of the Kosovar Albanian delegation had
told Washington "in unequivocal terms" that they will sign a
Kosovo peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"We have received this morning a letter signed by Mr (Hashim)
Thaqi, who is chairman of the delegation, saying that the Kosovars
are prepared to sign the agreement and saying that in unequivocal
terms," National Security Adviser Sandy Berger told CNN in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
Berger also warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
NATO would use force to force him to comply with NATO's demand to
enter Kosovo, a sovereign province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if Mr Milosevic continues to be intransigent
and continues aggressive actions in Kosovo the issue will go back
to NATO and NATO has made clear in those circumstances it is
prepared to use force if necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Paris, where peace talks resumed on
Monday, said the Kosovar Albanians would within hours sign the
agreement. Referring to that, Berger said this would put the onus
on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The commitment by the Kosovar Albanians "shifts the focus now
entirely on Mr Milosevic to make a choice between peace and
further bloodshed and conflict," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed Thaqi's letter followed a conversation on Sunday
evening between the Thaqi and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.

<HEADLINE> Scientists to Accelerate Human Genome Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- British and American scientists
announced Monday that a major acceleration will complete the
foundation of the ambitious Human Genome Project considerably
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The first preliminary "working draft" of the human genome,
man's whole genetic blueprint, will be available by February 2000,
much earlier than expected, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The "working draft", which consists at least 90 percent of the
human genome, will be produced jointly by Sanger Center in the UK,
which is funded by Britain's Wellcome Trust, some U.S.
laboratories and several other research centers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Wellcome Trust announced that a "working
draft" of the human genome would be available in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"However, the pooling of expertise and the increase in
resources between British and American genome centers have proved
that a 'working draft' can be available much earlier," Dr Michael
Morgan, Chief Executive of the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, said
Monday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The significant change of schedule for spring 2000 is "great
news for global scientific community", he added.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the "working draft" will provide invaluable
information for biomedical researchers and will act as the
foundations on which the finished genome, to be completed by 2003,
will be built.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers Continue Focus on Agenda 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The 15 European Union (EU)
finance ministers met here on Monday to continue their discussion
about the bloc's budget reform program, known as Agenda 2000 in EU
jargon.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reportedly examined the state of negotiations on
the EU's medium-term financial perspective for 2000 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
Their agriculture colleagues partly made compromise last
Thursday on farm spending, which accounts for nearly half of the
EU's total budget.
</P>
<P>
But the bloc's foreign ministers in their meeting on Sunday
were mired over how to overhaul the budget to enable 12 candidate
countries from central and eastern Europe to join the union.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has said the key
sticking point was austerity in farm and regional spending to make
room in the budget for newcomers early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
At the Sunday meeting, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
made clear that his country was unable to endorse a draft accord
on farm spending in the 2000-2006 period.
</P>
<P>
He said the deal made by agriculture ministers on March 11 is
in contradiction with freezing outlays and the idea of reducing
net payments to the EU by some countries, notably Germany.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed deal, farm support will be about 313 billion
euros (343 billion U.S. dollars) over a seven-year period from
2000 through 2006, or about 44.7 billion euros (48.9 billion
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
EU finance ministers have called for spending to be kept at its
present level of 40.4 billion euros (44.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Agricultural funding is the biggest element in the EU's 86
billion euros (94.3 billion dollars) annual budget, but is also
the bloc's longest-lasting and most visible sign of integration.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner responsible for agriculture, Franz Fischler,
has said the preliminary farm deal "was the most radical reform
since the European Union Common Agricultural Policy was first
established in the early 1960s."
</P>
<P>
Germany, the current rotating president of the EU, has asked
finance ministers and heads of government of the EU member states
to approve the deal at a summit meeting in Berlin later this month.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the agreement could run into
difficulties because the meeting is aimed at bringing the total EU
budget under control to set the scene for new members to enter the
European club.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Demands Belgrade Accept NATO Terms on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Monday threatened Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with NATO
air strikes if he did not agree to sign the NATO-imposed peace
accord on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was replying a question that if NATO would launch
strikes once Milosevic fails to sign the accord while the Kosovar

</P>
<P>
"If he shows intransigence and aggression I think that from my

</P>
<P>
Shortly before Clinton's remarks, the United States got a
letter from Hashim Thaqi, chairman of Kosovar Albanian delegation
to the Kosovo peace talks in Paris, which said the Kosovars were
prepared to sign the peace accord on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I would encourage Mr Milosevic to agree to the terms as well
so that we can avoid further conflict and bloodshed," Clinton told
reporters at the start of a meeting with NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
He called the deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo as the "best
chance to preserve the integrity of Serbia and avoid economic and
other adversity."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Solana met as peace negotiations between the Serbs
and Kosovar Albanians in Paris. Asked how long those negotiations
might run, Clinton said: "I think they ought to be able to talks
this through a little bit -- peace is better than war. Obviously
they can't go on indefinitely."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Won't Give up Mediating Efforts in Angola: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Special Envoy
to Angola said Monday that his departure does not mean that U.N.
has given up efforts in mediating the Angola problem.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for New York, Issa Diallo told reporters at the
Luanda International Airport that the withdrawal of the U.N. peace
mission and himself is only " a technical temporary retreat."
</P>
<P>
"U.N. has never planned to abandon Angola," said the special
envoy who assumed office on August 28, 1998 following the death of
his predecessor Aliuone Blongdin Beye who died in a plane crash in
June that year.
</P>
<P>
However, Diallo's efforts have not prevented the civil war
from erupting again Angola.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing U.N. special envoy said that the most urgent task
for the U. N. is to beef up humanitarian relief to the economy and
the whole society of Angola.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that to bring an early end to the war
in Angola, the diplomatic efforts of the international community
are also of great significance.
</P>
<P>
Diallo said that the U.N. is negotiating with the Angolan
government so that the organization could further play a part in
bringing peace to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He noted it is a good idea to set up an permanent agency in
Angola which will consist of the U.N. and relevant countries.
</P>
<P>
At the consistent request of Angola, the U.N. Security Council
on February 26 passed a resolution deciding not to further deploy
U.N. peace mission in Angola and to withdraw the mission's
personnel and materials from Angola by March 28.
</P>
<P>
However, Diallo said the complete withdrawal may take five
months technically.
</P>
<P>
U.N. hopes to keep a permanent representative agency or a
proxy body in Angola, while Angola clearly stated that there is no
problem in establishing such a body but its venue should be in
U.N.'s headquarters in New York.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stock Holdings Rises 20 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The value of U.S. households'
stock portfolios rose 20 percent to 10.77 trillion U.S. dollars
last year, the Federal Reserve Board said in the latest quarterly
report.
</P>
<P>
The holdings represent 25 percent of total U.S. household
assets, up from 10.4 percent of Americans' wealth 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The growing wealth of U.S. households has been one factor
fueling consumer spending, which contributed to the continued
growth of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal said Monday "the stock market is so
strong. Wealthier consumers are spending readily, and business
finds it easy to raise capital for investment."
</P>
<P>
Of the 10.77 trillion dollars the Americans hold in equities,
6.28 trillion dollars are in individual stocks and 1.73 trillion
dollars are in mutual funds, according to the report. The rest is
in bank trust funds and estates, life insurance companies and
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
If the wealth is divided among U.S. families, 68 percent of the
stock market wealth owned by households was held by the richest 5
percent of the population, according to a Federal survey.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said, the value of Americans' real
estate assets rose to 9.22 trillion U.S. dollars last year. In the
last decade, the value of U.S. households' real estate has
increased 55 percent compared with a 381 percent increase in the
value of their stocks.

<HEADLINE> More DRC Refugees Enter Into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Due to the fierce fighting in the
southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 5,000
refugees have fled to Northern Province of Zambia since early this
month, a senior official of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) told Xinhua here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dominik Bartsch, an official of UNHCR regional office based in
Lusaka, said that of the 5,000 refugees, 750 are ex-soldiers, some
of whom were disarmed before entering Zambia while the others were
disarmed by Zambia border soldiers as soon as they crossed into
the province adjacent to the war area of DRC.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has set up two camps in the province, one for civil
refugees and the other for the ex-soldiers, he said, adding that
the two camps can accommodate more refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has sent enough food, medicine and soap to the camps and
provided the refugees with water supplies. About 100 pit latrines
have been dug in the areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bartsch warned that if the fighting continues more refugees
will flee the war to Zambia and the number of refugees to enter
Zambia may increase from the current 5,000 to 10,000 in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR has made preparations for the possible influx of
DRC refugees, while Zambia has offered its large land for the
refugees and sent more medical workers to the refugee camps.

<HEADLINE> Lafontaine Remarks Fuel Battle over SPD's Direction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Complaints by ex-finance minister
Oskar Lafontaine over "poor teamwork" fueled a battle Monday over
whether Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats needed to
move left or right.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, a traditional socialist left-winger, resigned both
as finance minister and Social Democratic Party (SPD) chairman
last week after policy clashes with Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"I left because of the poor teamwork that we displayed over
recent months. You cannot work successfully if the teamwork is not
up to scratch," said Lafontaine in his first public comments
Sunday on why he made his surprise decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
Left-wingers in the SPD, dismayed over Lafontaine's departure,
used the remarks as evidence to bolster their demand that
Schroeder sack the head of the federal chancellery, Bodo Hombach.
</P>
<P>
A leading SPD leftist, Detlev von Larcher, said Hombach had
proven he could not handle running the chancellery and accused him
of spending too much time in the media limelight.
</P>
<P>
The Germany Minister of Transport and Construction Franz
Muentefering and the Minister of Development Aid Heidemarie
Wieczorek-Zeul defended Hombach. They said the government needed
to look to the future and not dwell on past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
But Wieczorek-Zeul also backed Lafontaine's demand that the SPD
remain a left-wing party and rejected any change of direction in
economics policy.
</P>
<P>
The battle over the party's and government's future direction
intensified Monday after Schroeder left on a five-day tour of EU's
capitals prior to next week's Berlin E.U. summit, according to
reports of the German Press Agency.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Say They Will Sign Peace Plan Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The chief delegate of the Kosovo
Albanians to the peace talks in Paris, Hashim Thaqi, said on
Monday that the Albanian delegation will sign the peace plan on
Kosovo elaborated by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Thaqi made the announcement after a meeting with French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
who are co-chairmen of the Kosovo peace talks.
</P>
<P>
``The Kosovar delegation has decided unanimously to say yes to
the interim agreement, even though the innocent people are killed
in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Kosovo Albanian delegation hopes to sign
the agreement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A signing of the agreement by Albanians will heighten pressure
on the Serbian side, which refuses to accept the deployment of a
NATO-led international force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan calls for substantial autonomy in Kosovo and the
deployment of a NATO-led international force to guarantee the
implementation of the plan of autonomy for ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The talks on Kosovo resumed on Monday in Paris after a
three-week interruption.

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was injured
on Monday in U.S. and British air raids against Iraqi civilian
and military targets, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying 14
formations of U.S. and British warplanes from Saudi and Kuwaiti
bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over Muthana, Qadisiya,
Misan and Basra provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes bombed some civilian facilities and military
sites and injured one civilian, said the spokesman, adding
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back and forced them to flee
to their bases.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between Iraqi air defenses and U.S. and British
warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones almost occurred every day
since the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
what they called "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared it does not recognize the no-fly zones and
will fire at any allied warplanes violating its airspace.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- One person was injured in a bomb
blast in the rich area of Ankara on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, planted under a car, exploded in the Ugur Mumcu
Street near the presidential palace in Ankara, shattering windows
of nearby buildings and causing great panic among people living in
the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that another car carrying two people was on
the scene when the incident occurred and they fled soon after.
</P>
<P>
A full investigation is underway.
</P>
<P>
The blast is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks
recently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anatolia News Agency reported Monday that
unidentified assailants threw two fire bombs on late Sunday night
at a building of the Democratic Left Party (DSP) led by Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit in Kirac district of Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 13 people were killed and six others wounded when

<HEADLINE> African Education Conference Opens In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A five-day African education
conference opened here Monday at which a Draft Program of Acton
for the Decade of Education in Africa will be adopted.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 delegates from the Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) member states attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
The participants will review the present education situation in
the continent, provide recommendations on the development of
education and finally adopt the Draft Program of Action for the
Decade of Education in Africa.
</P>
<P>
OAU Chief of Information Desmond Orjiako told reporters that
the conference will have an experts' meeting from March 15 to 17
and a ministers' conference from March 18 to 19.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference will, among other things, lobby
developed countries to swop debt with education assistance to
Africans.
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems faced by Africans is of debt payment. We
will try to lobby that part of the debt be channeled towards
educational development, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also examine the challenges offered by the
girl- child education and the role of governments in financing of
education.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the OAU declared the period between 1997 and 2006 the
Decade of Education in Africa with the main objective of removing
obstacles to progress towards education for all.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Zimbabwean Higher Education and Technology
Minister Ignatius Chombo urged the OAU to help its members have
their debts transformed into investments in education.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU should endeavour to promote and support negotiations
for the transformation of the debts of its member states into
investments in the educational sector," Chombo said.
</P>
<P>
France recently announced that it had either transformed debt
for poor nations into investments or simply written them off, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on OAU member states to remove disparities
related to gender, disability, ethnicity and religion in
education.
</P>
<P>
"Only if the disparities are removed will we develop
cost-effective windows for the socially and economically
disadvantaged groups in our society," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Talks See Turning Point as Albanians Accept Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The talks on Kosovo which resumed
Monday in Paris saw a turning point after Kosovo Albanians said
they would sign the interim peace plan for Kosovo presented by the
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Kosovo Albanian delegation, Hashim Thaqi,
who is a member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), made the
announcement after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
``The (Kosovo Albanian) delegation has unanimously decided to
say yes to the agreement,'' Thaqi told the press. ``We hope that
could be done on tomorrow (Tuesday).''
</P>
<P>
The interim agreement calls for establishing substantial
autonomy in Kosovo in three years with the deployment of a
NATO-led force to guarantee the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the respect of territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia and the disarming of KLA.
</P>
<P>
A signing of the agreement by the Albanians would heighten
pressure on the Yugoslav side, which categorically rejects the
deployment of foreign forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain, the co-chairmen of the peace talks on
Kosovo, said in a communique that they keep the hope that the
Yugoslav side would also finalize and sign the agreement,
especially the aspects concerning the implementation of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Western countries consider a deployment of NATO troops in
Kosovo indispensable for an implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said at a press
conference that after the Kosovo Albanians have agreed to accept
the agreement, the Yugoslav leaders are ``at the foot of the
wall'' and has to either accept or reject the agreement.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that the Western
countries would from now on increase their pressure on the Serbian
delegation to make it accept a deployment of NATO force.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Serbs have lost their ``first line of
defense'' and no longer have any excuse not to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The United States President Bill Clinton said that it is time
for Yugoslavia and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to sign
the agreement to ``avoid new violence and bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that if Belgrade
continues to reject the agreement, NATO will have few choices.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The first of a new series of
quarterly releases of statistics on external debt for 176
developing and transition countries was jointly published on
Monday by the World Bank and other three multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
This is in response to requests for dissemination of more
timely external debt indicators, the World Bank said in a
statement. The other three agencies engaged in the project are the
Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary
Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD).
</P>
<P>
The statistics are accessible through each agency's website.
</P>
<P>
The aim of this initiative is to facilitate access to a single
set of data which brings together information currently compiled
and published separately by the contributing institutions on
components of countries' external debt, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the figures cover essentially all countries and
territories on the list of aid recipients of the Development
Assistance Committee of the OECD, including practically all
non-OECD countries, as well as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea,
Mexico, Poland and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Nuclear Arms Means of Deterrence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia may use nuclear weapons if
all other measures have failed to ward off a direct threat to its
security, a high-ranking official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the guidelines for Russia's nuclear deterrence policy
approved by President Boris Yeltsin, First Deputy Security Chief
Vyacheslav Mikhailov said Moscow sees its nuclear forces as a
"guarantor of its national security and a means of deterring
aggression" against itself and its allies, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the guidelines, the main purpose of Russia's
nuclear deterrence policy is to guarantee the territorial
integrity and independence of Russia and its allies and prevent
external barriers to Russia's development.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Mikhailov's statement was made in the wake
of the official admission of three new members into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland became official members
of the NATO at a ceremony in Missouri, the United States, last
week.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been a staunch opponent to NATO expansion, saying
the move creates new division lines in Europe and constitutes a
threat to its security interests.
</P>
<P>
However, a document signed by Yeltsin on the nuclear arms
guidelines said the policy is not directed against any specific
state or groups of states.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, according to the guidelines, considers its nuclear arms
primarily as a means of deterrence and may use them only as an
extreme measure to fend off a critical threat to the security of
Russia or any of its allies.
</P>
<P>
"As long as there are nuclear weapons in the arsenals of other
states, the guaranteed nuclear deterrence of an aggressor against
Russia or its allies is one of the most important priorities of
the Russian state," Mikhailov said.
</P>
<P>
The document also said that Russia stands for consistent
international efforts to reduce global nuclear arsenals and
ultimately destroy them.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that in the prevention of military threats priority
should be given to political, diplomatic, legal and other
non-military measures, including actions by the U.N. aimed at
maintaining peace and cutting short acts of aggression," Mikhailov
said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Receives Over 54,000 Deportees from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has received more than
54,000 deportees from Ethiopia, the Eritrean Relief and Refugee
Commission (ERREC) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
ERREC commissioner Worku Tesfamichael told Xinhua that Eritrea
 received some 1,800 deportees from March 2 to March 7 this year.
But she said she did not receive any deportation report from the
ERREC branches Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the deportees are Ethiopians of Eritrean origin or
those who got married to the Eritreans, she said, adding that they
had been living in Ethiopia for over 10 or even 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the deportees left their properties in Ethiopia and
have arrived with nothing but clothes on their bodies, she noted.
</P>
<P>
"We don't see them as a burden," Worku said. "Once they
entered Eritrea, we see them as Eritreans," she added.
</P>
<P>
"They're productive, (and are) among the majority who
contributed to the economic development in Ethiopia," she said,
noting that they can help push Eritrean economy forward.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government arranges training for them so that they
can later find jobs by themselves and run their own lives.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has one training center in each of its six regions and
the government has arranged for the deportees to receive free
on-job training in electric workshop and wood workshop in addition
to offering them medical training and information and guidance.
</P>
<P>
Worku said the Eritrean government has opened a credit facility
so that the deportees can start their own businesses, because most
of them were business people.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks in Eritrea are open to both the Eritreans and
the deportees with feasible projects, Worku said, noting some
deportees have started agricultural activities and commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
Worku said that ERREC has submitted appeals to the
international agencies such as the United Nations World Food
Program ( WFP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, asking for assistance, but has received nothing since
the Ethio-Eritrean war started last May.
</P>
<P>
These world organizations have been expected to play their due
roles in stopping the victimization of the civil population who
have nothing to do with the border conflict and to provide relief
assistance to the war-affected population on both sides, she said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has reportedly approved a 24.3-million-U.S. dollar
emergency operation to feed up to 272,000 Ethiopians internally
displaced by the border conflict between the two Horn of Africa
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The operation, expected to be underway by the end of March,
will last nine months and will involve distribution of some 45,000
tons of food aid to mainly women and children in Ethiopia's
northern Tigray region.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Advises Primakov Not to Quarrel With Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Monday advised Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to be less
emotional in his reaction to its criticism of the government.
</P>
<P>
"I do not like your relations with the media," Yeltsin said in
his first televised appearance since his hospitalization for
stomach ulcer some two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting at the Central Clinical Hospital, Yeltsin
told Primakov that initially he was also irritated by criticism
direct at himself.
</P>
<P>
"But I forced myself not to act so sharply and negatively to
the criticism of me," Itar-Tass quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He told Primakov that negative relations with the media only
"irritate journalists instead of calming down the situation, and
the media begin to snap back and invent what does not exist at
all."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, in response, said Yeltsin has "stronger nerves."
</P>
<P>
"You are a calmer man than m. But I will take your advice,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
During the television appearance, Yeltsin also denied any split
between him and Primakov.
</P>
<P>
He accused the mass media of intending to "drive a wedge
between Yeltsin and Primakov."
</P>
<P>
"Nature has not even created such a wedge," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting between the two Russian leaders was their
first since Yeltsin checked into the hospital and Primakov headed
for a 10-day vacation in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi at the
insistence of Yeltsin on February 27.
</P>
<P>
Primakov informed Yeltsin of the results of the latest cabinet
session in which the payment of wages and pensions in the country
was discussed, Interfax reported, quoting the presidential press
service.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed the situation in the coal industry,
Chechnya, and Moscow's ongoing talks with the International
Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Not to Abandon People of Angola after Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Issa Diallo, the U.N.
special representative in Angola, stressed that the United Nations
is not abandoning Angola after the full withdrawal of staff and
peacekeepers by March 20, a U.N. spokesman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
Diallo, who served in Angola since August last year, is expected
to return to the U.N. headquarters in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Diallo, who became head of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Angola
after the previous special representative, Alioune Blondin Beye,
died in a plane crash in June, insisted that the international
communtiy's role in Angola was not yet dead.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations pulls out of Angola next week frustrated by
the country's slide back into civil war after a decade-long U.N.
peacekeeping efforts in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is scheduled to make a full withdrawal from
the country by March 20, following a Security Council resolution,
adopted last month, to close down the peacekeeping operations of
the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), saying that there was
no more peace left to keep.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government forces and rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) began fighting again
late last year, shattering a 1994 peace accord designed to put an
end to more than 20 years of civil war in the diamond-rich
country.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in a response to
appeals from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to maintain limited
U.N. presence in Angola, has since December called repeatedly for
the U.N. to pull out of his country, saying the world body watched
UNITA remobilize and did nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers came to Angola in 1989 to monitor the
peace process in the country. MONUA has steadily cut back its
forces in 1997, when peace prospects looked solid. From a peak of
7,000 observers, numbers were cut to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will shortly appoint a new special
representative, based in New York, who will make regular trips to
Angola and try to keep up dialogue with the government and the
troika of nations which oversees the collapsed 1994 agreement --
the United States, Portugal and Russia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Completes Staff Withdrawal from Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Agencies has
completed the withdrawal of staff from central Angola as fighting
escalated near the Kuito, capital of Bie province, largely
reducing the U.N. presence in the war-torn southwest African
country, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"On Saturday, March 13, U.N. agencies completed the withdrawal
of staff from Kuito, Bie province, as fighting intensified near
this strategic capital," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"This development reduces the already limited presence of
humanitarian organizations to eight of 18 provincial capitals," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, about 80 percent of relief aid provided by
humanitarian agencies is delivered by air as access to 60 percent
of the country remains restricted," the spokesman said. "Some
480,000 new internally displaced persons are currently receiving
assistance in relatively safe areas."
</P>
<P>
"Ongoing humanitarian programs include the provision of food
rations, health care, immunization, as well as education for
displaced children and nutritional feeding centers for the
severely malnourished," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Where possible, seeds and tools are also being provided in an
attempt to improve food security conditions for displaced and host
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are underway to ensure that humanitarian
organizations can conduct independent evaluations to confirm
reports of additional displaced persons and host communities in
critical humanitarian conditions throughout the Angolan
territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies have confirmed the existence of 650,000 out of
a total of 1.5 million persons estimated to have abandoned their
homes and sought refuge within Angola.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is expected to make a full withdrawal from
the southwest African country by March 20, following the U.N.
Security Council decided in late February not to extend the
mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), which
expired on February 26.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government has insisted to see the exit of U.N.
peacekeepers out of Angola, but Luanda asked U.N. humanitarian
agencies to maintain continued presence in the country.

<HEADLINE> Air France Accused of Dominant Position Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Air France has been accused
by the US Justice Department of abuse of a dominant position and
is facing a probe by the European Commission, the European Union
(EU)'s executive body.
</P>
<P>
The commission said here Monday that it has decided to open a
formal procedure against Air France for the possible abuse. After
a initial inquiry, the EU executive considers that the French
airline has discriminated against SABRE, a computerized
reservation system (CRS) owned by American Airlines, to favor its
partly owned CRS -- Amadeus.
</P>
<P>
This case was presented by the US Department of Justice under
the Positive Comity provisions of the 1991 EU-US Cooperation
Agreement in the field of competition.
</P>
<P>
In an objection assessment, the commission, the EU's law
proposing and enforcing arm, said Air France provided Amadeus with
more accurate information and on a more timely basis than it did
to other computerized reservation systems, thus putting its
competitors at a disadvantage. This practice concerned a limited
number of Air France's domestic and international tariffs between
1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the 15-nation bloc's competition rules, such an opening
of the procedure should not be interpreted as a final
condemnation, the commission said. "It is rather a step in the
procedure allowing Air France to express its views on the matter."
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said it will take a final view on this matter
only once Air France has had an opportunity to respond to the
objection raised.
</P>
<P>
CRS has a very significant role in the travel industry and is
the most widely used tool for travel agents to obtain information
on travel services and to make reservation for their customers.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Take Action Against Censured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
will take some action against State Minister of Finance Sam
Kutesa, who was censured by parliament in early March, an official
told Xinhua Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kagole Kivumbi, public relations officer for parliament, said
it is in the law that the president should take some action
against a censured minister.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 118 of Uganda's constitution, the
president "shall take some appropriate action" once officially
informed of a censure passed in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
However, the law does not specify what kind of action the
president should take against a censured minister and when to take
the action, Kivumbi said.
</P>
<P>
"Once a minister is censured, it will be very difficult for him
to work in parliament because other MPs can leave when he stands
up to speak," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kutesa was censured by parliament on March 4 on charges of
political and financial impropriety over the divestiture of ground
cargo handling services at Entebbe International Airport, south of
the capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
He is the second minister censured by parliament. Jim Muhwezi,
 former state minister of education and sports, was censured last
year for abuse of office. President Museveni did not expel him
from the cabinet immediately, but removed him from the list in a
subsequent cabinet reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> SADC Security Committee Meeting Opens in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The security committee of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) gathered in
Mbabane, Swaziland, Monday to put forth proposals for the upcoming
ministerial defense and security meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was opened by Swazi Foreign Minister Albert
Shabangu, who said the 150 delegates faced a daunting task, given
the region's complex and sensitive security situation, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Shabangu said since the last meeting of the inter-state
security committee, the region had seen the outbreak of war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a resumption of fighting in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of other states in the DRC conflict posed the
risk of a widening regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
Shabangu said regional conflict was threatening investor
confidence and thus the future prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the region's problems stemmed from Africa's
colonial past, which saw borders being drawn by European powers
without attention to political and social realities.
</P>
<P>
Swazi King Mswati III is due to open the two-day ministerial
meeting Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urged to Improve Ties With GCC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Monday urged Iran to peacefully
solve its islands dispute with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a
positive gesture toward improving ties with the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
"If Iran accepts a peaceful solution, the move will be viewed
as a tangible step toward improving ties with the GCC states," the
ministers said in a final statement issued at the end of their
two-day meeting in Saudi capital Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the importance that Iran "translate its
policies, announced after Iranian President Mohammad Khatami took
office in 1997, to tangible and practical steps, words and
actions."
</P>
<P>
It called on Tehran to end the islands dispute through direct
international negotiations or by resorting to the international
court of justice.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE claim sovereignty over the islands of Abu
Moussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are located near the
strategic shipping lanes at the mouth of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran has controlled the islands since 1971 after Britain ended
its protectorate and Tehran has so far offered negotiations on Abu
Moussa alone.
</P>
<P>
Iran established a town hall and an educational complex on Abu
Moussa in February and conducted massive military exercises near
the island recently.
</P>
<P>
The statement said these actions showed Iran attempts to
consolidate its occupation.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers confirmed UAE's sovereignty over the
three islands and their "absolute support to all peaceful means
and measures the UAE has been adopting to restore its sovereignty
over the islands," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Tehran to end its occupation and halt
construction of Iranian installations on the islands in a bid to
alter its demographic structure.
</P>
<P>
It said these acts constituted " a blatant violation of the
sovereignty of the UAE and a dangerous threat to security and
stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
GCC foreign ministers, at the request of the UAE, held an
extraordinary meeting in Abu Dhabi on March 4 to discuss the
Iranian acts.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Hails NATO Admission of New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze said Monday that NATO's formal admission of three new
members "completes an important stage in the final unification of
a Europe that was divided into two opposite camps by
totalitarism."
</P>
<P>
In his regular radio address to the nation, Shevardnadze said
after the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, other countries will
also be admitted to NATO.
</P>
<P>
The process can no longer be stopped, he said, Interfax
reported in a dispatch from Tbilisi, capital of the former Soviet
republic.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said he does not want to irritate anyone by his
declaration."Nobody intends to open NATO doors to Georgia today,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that model Georgian- Russian relations be developed
and that an atmosphere of mutual trust and non-interference be
created within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
"The patronizing of terrorists and other criminal groups should
be given up," he said.
</P>
<P>
"One may speak of possible steps in the direction of NATO" only
after this, Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed disappointment that the large-scale treaty between
Russia and Georgia has not been ratified by the Russian State
Duma, or lower house of parliament, for over three years.
</P>
<P>
"Let's think the fact over and then argue who will be joining
NATO, the EU or other organizations and when," Shevardnadze said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Attack Iraqi Sites in No-fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes on Monday
attacked Iraqi air defense site in both northern and southern
no-fly zones, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force said in a statement from Incirlik Air Base
in Turkey that F-15E jets based there, alleging they were
challenged by Iraqi radar, dropped an unspecified number of
laser-guided bombs on several artillery batteries northwest of the
city of Mosul.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military Central Command also said in a statement that
Air Force F-16 and Navy F/a-18 and F-14 jets attacked an Iraqi
radar relay site 200 miles (320 km) southeast of Baghdad and
another radar site 290 miles (465 km)of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes have taken it as regular missions to bomb Iraqi
air defense sites since last December's bombing raids against
Iraqi military and security targets in an attempt to reduce Iraqi
arsenal of its air defense system and provoke Baghdad to take
risky action so that Washington and its ally Britain could take
one more sweeping bombings against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, U.S. fighter jets bombed anti-aircraft artillery
sites near Mosul after being fired upon and detecting Iraq radar
tracking the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has since December said it no longer recognize no-fly
zones imposed by the United States and Britain since the Gulf
War in 1991. It said it would challenge any Western warplanes
invading its sovereign air spaces over the so-called no-fly
zones.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Starts Probe into Antiquities Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's judiciary has started
investigation into corruption scandals involving antiquities
thefts one month after an illegal oil deal was disclosed, judicial
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Public Prosecutor Khaled Hammoud has already launched a wide
ranging investigation into embezzlement and squandering of state
funds by the Directorate-General of Antiquities (DGA) at the
Ministry of Culture and Higher Education in the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
Some inquires showed that a number of artifacts have gone
missing and the funds reserved for the DGA had been used for
personal purpose such as the construction of houses, the sources
said, without giving a specific figure of the embezzled money or
any other details.
</P>
<P>
Hammoud has requested the dispatch of units from the country's
Office for Combating Financial Fraud to inspect the country's
major tourist and antiquities places in a bid to check lists of
antiquities with those actually on display.
</P>
<P>
The scandal came only one month after former Oil Minister Shahe
Barsoumian was charged with approving an illicit oil deal, which
resulted in the squandering of around 800 million U.S. dollars
during his term in office from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Observers said this is the beginning of an all-out campaign
launched by President Emile Lahoud against the prevailing
corruption which plagued the previous regime.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud took over office from his predecessor Elias Hrawi
last November.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 15 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, the Romanian national
currency leu in the period to March 15, slided back 17.75 percent
against the U.S. dollar, with an annualised rate of inflation of
5.9 percent in January-February, in the same year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's inflation rate hit 59.1 percent, but the
leu plunged only 26.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar in the New Year sold 10,951 lei, with an
average rate of exchange calculated by Romania's central bank of
13,555 lei for one U.S. dollar on March 15.
</P>
<P>
Over March 8-12, the national currency skipped back 1,52
percent on the previous week and took a 23.78 percent battering
against the January rate.
</P>
<P>
The central bank weighed in the market to prop up the leu, but
the depreciation continued regardless. The bank soaked off the
glut of liquidity by offering interest rates ranging from 95
percent to 200 percent for lei deposits.
</P>
<P>
The inflation forecast for the months immediately ahead place
the interest rates at relatively high levels and points at a 2-2.5
percent weakening of the national unit as opposed to the American
bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania is to implement an
important program of forest regeneration, that is to include
more than 22,000 hectares, announced the National Forestry Company
which starts on Monday the traditional ''Forest Month''.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, among the 22,000 ha included in the
program, 13,000 ha of them have to be afforested by planting new
trees, while the remaining 9.000 ha will recover by natural
regeneration. Some of the planting actions are to be performed on
derelict lands, taken over by the forestry fund, as they cannot be
used for farming or other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Protection tree curtains are to be planted along several
hundreds of hectares of croplands, an action great Romanian
farming engineer Ion Ionescu de la Brad had initiated in the
Romanian agriculture as early as 1860.
</P>
<P>
Romania owns a valuable forestry fund counting 6,342,328 ha in
late 1997, or 26.8 percent of Romania's territory. Most of them,
namely 94.7 percent are state-run and are managed by the National
Forestry Company, whereas 5.3 percent is private property. The
ratio of forest surface per inhabitant is of 0.27 ha, lower than
Europe's average.
</P>
<P>
Romania owns about 9 percent of the continent's wood resources,
and as for the average wood mass it ranks fourth after
Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
plans to introduce minimum wages for poorly-paid domestic and farm
workers, Labor Minister Membathisi Mdladlana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the states can and will set statutory
minimum wages for workers in these sectors," South African Press
Association quoted him as saying in Cape Town.
</P>

Mdladlana said the Basic Conditions of Employment Act,

</P>
<P>
It is very difficult at this stage to say what level is

According to the minister, the government is concerned by the
fact that 25 percent of South Africans currently earn less than
500 rand (80 U.S. dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
He denied that existing labor legislation is too inflexible and
destroys jobs.

creation, we are prepared to look at them," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Could Face Worst Year in Dealing With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could face its
worst year yet in dealing with cases and deaths from malaria, the
Medical Research Council said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement appeared at an African malaria conference in
Durban, a port city in the east of the country, South African
Press Association said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Health Department indicated that more than
8,000 cases and 37 deaths were reported in the first two months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than 26,300 cases and 193 deaths were reported,
compared with 27,000 cases and 163 deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Given that South Africa has one of the best malaria control
programs in Africa, the country's situation bodes ill for the rest
of the continent, where malaria causes over one million deaths and
up to 480 million cases every year.
</P>
<P>
"Children are the most vulnerable, and it is estimated that
nearly 3,000 children under (the age of) five die each day of
malaria," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Another document presented at the Durban conference said
malaria was a public health problem in more than 90 countries
inhabited by an estimated 2. 4 billion people.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria is estimated to cause up to 500 million clinical cases
and 2.7 million deaths a year. Every 30 seconds, a child
somewhere dies of malaria.
</P>
<P>
"The global effects of the disease threaten public health and
productivity on a broad scale and impede the progress of many
countries toward democracy and prosperity," it said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of deaths caused by malaria were among children in
Africa, especially those in rural areas with poor access to health
services.
</P>
<P>
Other high risk groups were pregnant women, travellers,
refugees, displaced persons and workers entering endemic areas.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference is being held under the auspices of the
 Multilateral Initiative on Malaria established two years ago to
promote malaria research in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The conference hopes to promote collaboration between
scientists in the United States and Europe and their South African
counterparts.

LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Cholera is spreading widely in
southeastern Liberia with up to 20 people dying daily, according
to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Jackson Dueh, director of the only hospital

alarming and reaching epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of cholera in the remote area of Grand Kru, one of
the least developed and most inaccessible areas in the west
African country, was blamed on the lack of safe drinking water in
the region where people collect drinking water from contaminated
creeks.
</P>
<P>
Following the outbreak of cholera in Grand Kru, the Liberian
government has given orders to all 90 members of the Liberian
parliament to visit their constituencies and take necessary
measures to prevent further spreading of the epidemic disease.

<HEADLINE> EU: Status of Jersusalem Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite angry Israeli protests the
European Union (EU) is sticking to its stance that under
international law the status of Jerusalem is undecided, said
Germany which currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann told reporters
Monday in Bonn: "The Europeans do not intend to change their
practice in regard to contacts with Palestinian personalities in
East Jerusalem".
</P>
<P>
Erdmann said the new controversy between Israel and the EU was
sparked by a February 15 diplomatic note which the Israeli
government sent to the E.U. presidency. In the note Israel
reiterated its stance that it regards Jerusalem as its capital and
part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In response, Germany on March 1 reiterated the EU position that
under international law Jerusalem had a special "Corpus Separatum"
status. At the same time it rejected demands that EU officials
refrain from meeting Palestinian politicians in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erdmann said,"Germany on behalf of the European Union made
clear that from our point of view the file is closed."
</P>
<P>
The EU statement had sparked angry reactions in Israel. The
German embassy in Israel had received anonymous threats, German
government sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians lay claim to East Jerusalem, which Israel
annexed in 1967, as the capital of their future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Monday hailed as
"positive and constructive" the atmosphere of the foreign
ministerial meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which
wrapped up in the day.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from the meeting which started on Sunday in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh, the minister expressed satisfaction with
his fellow GCC executives for their call on Iraq to implement all
U.N. resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers, in a final statement, also urged
Iraq to refrain from threatening Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
security and stability of the region, according to Kuwait News
Agency.

on boosting such ties on the basis of principles of the GCC
Supreme Council.
</P>
<P>

solve the territorial dispute by peaceful means and international
arbitration.

comprehensive solution in the region will not materialize without

CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Several Gulf states have postponed their deals
signing with arms producing countries at the ongoing Abu Dhabi
international arms show due to the sharp decline in their oil
revenues, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The total income of the Gulf states from exporting oil
dropped to less than 60 billion U.S. dollars from nearly 90
billion dollars in 1996 and 180 billion dollars in 1980, the
Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Public Works and Water Resources
Mahmoud Abu Zeid has called for the formation of the first pan
Arab council for water, saying such council will be beneficial to
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Zeid made the appeal at the opening session of the higher
council meeting of the Inter-Arab Engineers Association, the Al
Hayat reported Monday.

He said Arab integration in the water field is quite urgent and
he called upon the Arabs to give up their regional differences and
work toward joint Arab economic integration.

advanced regional network of roads, railways and electricity, and
the promulgation of legislation for the protection of the
environment in the Arab states.

In a quick reaction to the Israeli move, Asefi called the

international norms and laws," according to the official Islamic
Republic News Agency Monday.

<P>
The agency reported that the spokesman on Sunday evening called
on the world community and Islamic nations to counter such "evil
expansionist designs" of Israel. (BC-Iran-Israel-Jerusalem)

<HEADLINE> General: NATO Expansion Hurts System of Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian general said
Monday that NATO's eastward expansion damages the present system
of treaties in arms reduction, the press service of the Russian
Defense Ministry reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Valeri Manikov, first deputy chief of the Russian
General Staff, said the admission of the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland last Friday "leads to upsetting the balance on the
European continent."
</P>
<P>
The expansion "generates the danger of remilitarization of the
entire system of international relations and destruction of the
operating system of treaties" in arms reduction, Manikov said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's position on the "inadmissibility of
inclusion of former Soviet republics into the bloc."
</P>
<P>
On the proposed union of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia,
Manikov said, "if such a structure helps to consolidate peace and
stability, this idea evidently has the right to life."
</P>
<P>
"The military nightstick cannot be regarded as the main
argument in the present-day world on the threshold of the 21st
century," the general said. "This is a road to destruction and
instability in interstate relations."
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the numerical
strength of NATO's European grouping is strengthened by 13
divisions with the admission of the three new members. The
frontiers of the alliance advanced by 650-750 kilometers to the
east.
</P>
<P>
"Real security and a truly lasting peace can be built only on
equal, mutually advantageous and good-neighborly partnership,"
Manikov said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Moscow's disagreement with the NATO expansion
does not mean its refusal to cooperate with that structure in the
interests of a new and more reliable system of European security.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A suspected male Tamil rebel was
taken into police custody Tuesday in connection with a suicide
bombing in a suburb of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, informed
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombing took place around 5:40 p.m. local time at a
bus stand near the Mount Lavinia police station, killing at least
four, including the suicide woman bomber.
</P>
<P>
The sources said another male companion of the suicide bomber
had swallowed a cyanide capsule before being apprehended.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed that several people were injured in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The sources said 10 persons with serious injuries were admitted
to the Colombo-South hospital at Kalubowila where two succumbed to
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomber had targeted the vehicle of Police Inspector
Nilabdeen of the Mount Lavinia Police Intelligence Unit who is
among the injured, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They added some vehicles traveling on the road near the blast
site were reported to have been damaged.
</P>

Early last week, Colombo was hit by a spate of terrorist bomb
attacks. Police suspect that Tamil rebels had sent bomb squads to
disrupt civilian life in the capital.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Construction Climbs to Highest Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Tuesday that construction of single-family homes rose 1.1 percent
in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million
units, the highest level since December 1978.
</P>
<P>
The applications for new building permits also soared to an
all-time high as robust economy sustained a boom in the housing
industry, said the Department.
</P>
<P>
Overall, housing construction dipped a slight 0.6 percent last
month as the increase in single-family housing starts was offset
by a 6.3 percent drop in construction of apartments.
</P>
<P>
In February, the 1.80 million annual rate for home and
apartment construction was down only slightly from January's
12-year high of 1.81 million units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, applications for building permits for single-family
homes rose 2.7 percent to an annual rate of 1.31 million units,
the highest level since 1960 when the government began tracking
housing starts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the boom in housing construction is due to
healthy economy with strong job growth and low inflation. The
absence of inflationary pressures has allowed the Federal Reserve
to keep interest rates low, which has translated into low mortgage
rates for home buyers.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, builders started 1.62 million units, an 11-year high.
Economists are predicting a modest decline in that pace this year
as the economy slows under the weight of the Asian currency
crisis. But so far, there have been few signs of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the small 0.6 percent drop in overall housing
starts was the first setback since a 2.6 percent decline in last
November.
</P>
<P>
Overall, applications for building permits dipped 1.8 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.75 million units. The
2.7 percent increase in applications for single-family homes was
offset by a 13.3 percent dip in applications for apartment units.

<HEADLINE> Over 20 Killed as Somali Factions Fight for Bay Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attacks and counter-attacks have been carried out between
the militiamen of Rahanwein Resistance Army and those of faction
leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid after their relationship keeps ever
souring.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes with battle wagons and rocket-propelled grenades
have taken place at the town center, a farm known as Berta Erkoleh
about one kilometer north of the town, and Manyafiulka area, about
five kilometers south of the town, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation has resulted in the defeat of the RRA
fighters who were chased back into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
The RRA spokesman here in Mogadishu, Mohamed Aden Qalinleh, has
vowed that his team will continue fighting as long as Hussein
Aidid's men remain in occupation of the Rahanwein territories.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the Rahanwein and Hussein Aidid's
militiamen began after his father late General Aidid had captured
southern Bay region in late September 1995. Several hundred people
are believed to have died from both sides since then.
</P>
<P>
The tension had eased for a while following the signature of
the Cairo peace deal in late 1997, but then had re-escalated after
Hussein Aidid had practically demonstrated his unwillingness to
pull out his militiamen from the Bay region.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-German Ties not Deteriorating: Israeli FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon said on Tuesday the Israeli-German ties have not been
marred by a dispute over the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel has friendly ties with Germany and the ties will not
change just for the Jerusalem issue, Sharon told reporters before
meeting with foreign diplomats in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel will insist on its position over the status of
Jerusalem, said the minister, adding the position is that
Jerusalem is the indivisible capital of the Jewish country
and will remain as part of Israel forever.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries launched a war against Israel a year after
the U.N. passed the Resolution 181 in 1947, which endorsed the
establishment of a Palestinian and a Jewish state in
Palestine and the internationalization of Jerusalem, Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
As the Arab countries violated the resolution, it has been
nullified and Israel will not accept it, Sharon added.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later had it annexed. But the Palestinians have been
trying to establish an independent nation with east Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Germany, currently holding the European Union (EU)
presidency, sent a letter to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, saying
that the EU considers Jerusalem as an occupied territory and
calls for the internationalization of the city.
</P>
<P>
Israel has rejected the EU's position vehemently.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused the PNA of failing to fulfill its commitment to
fight terrorism and suspended the implementation of the Wye
agreement signed with the Palestinians last October.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Pilgrims Plane Lands in Saudi Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi jetliner
carrying 110 Iraqi pilgrims has reportedly landed in Saudi
airport of Jeddah Tuesday, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-made Illusion-76 carrier, which belongs to the
Iraqi air force, landed at about 10:00 GMT, in violation of
U.N. sanctions that ban flights in and out of Iraq, the news
agency quoted unofficial sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Saudi authorities allowed the
plane to land in the airport and provided it with the
usual facilities for pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi plane took off from Baghdad Tuesday morning, heading
for the holy shrines in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, where pilgrims will
perform rituals of hajj.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from the Rasheed airport, a military
airport in southern Baghdad. Iraqi Minister of Endowment and
Religious Affairs Abdul Munem Ahmed Saleh was also on board.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Iraq broke the air ban imposed on
the country after the 1991 Gulf War. In 1997, an Iraqi plane
carrying Iraq's elderly pilgrims flew to Jeddah airport in
southwestern Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of over 22 million, can send up to
22,000 pilgrims to Mecca under quotas set by the Organization of
the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 3,000 Iraqi pilgrims made the trip to Mecca to
perform hajj. In 1997, Iraq flew a planeload of pilgrims to Mecca
and other pilgrims were flown by helicopters to the Iraqi-Saudi
border despite a ban on flights over Iraq enforced by the U.S. and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Muslims around the world are pouring into Saudi Arabia to
perform the annual pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, 75
kilometers away from the Red Sea side city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports reaching here said that about half a million
of pilgrims have already arrived in Saudi Arabia. Some 2 million
Muslims from inside and outside the kingdom perform the
pilgrimage every year.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Session for ASEAN Finance Ministers Meeting Held in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Deputy finance ministers and deputy
central bank governors of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) met here Tuesday to prepare the first report on
the ASEAN surveillance process.
</P>
<P>
The session, the second of its kind held by the ASEAN Select
Committee (ASC), was a preparation step for the third ASEAN
Finance Ministers Meeting slated for March 18-19.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance report highlights the regional economic
situation, prospects for economic recovery, possible risks and
concerted policy actions which the ASEAN finance ministers could
consider at their meeting, according to Vietnam News Agency (VNA).
</P>
<P>
The report is consistent with the assessment of other
international financial institutes that the economic crisis in
ASEAN has bottomed out and that the region's economies are
beginning to recover.
</P>
<P>
Recent signs of recovery include stable exchange rates, reduced
interest rates, recovering regional stock markets and lowered
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The gradual improvement reflects the measures adopted by ASEAN
countries, specific to the conditions prevailing in each, to cope
with the crisis and resume the momentum of growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared with inputs coming from the ASEAN
Secretariat's ASEAN Surveillance Coordinating Unit, the ASEAN
Central Bank Forum and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN surveillance process mechanism is the peer review
process of the ASEAN finance ministers to closely monitor
macro-economic and financial indicators in the region and
represents a major ASEAN response to the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed to at the second ASEAN finance ministers
meeting held in Jakarta last year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM's Hope High for WTO Top Post: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi now has more than 50
percent chance to win the ongoing race for the top post of the
World Trade Organization, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Surin confirmed a recent report that Canadian candidate for the
post Roy McLaren had withdrawn from the race after he was
informed by the chairman of the WTO's ruling General Assembly that
he was not in a position to garner unanimous support from members
of the body.
</P>
<P>
"The move increases Dr. Supachai's chance to win the race for
the WTO's top seat to over 50 percent," Surin said, adding that
the country will make whatever efforts to maintain his
front-runner position in the race.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also urged the selection process for the
WTO's new directorship be completed soon since the term of
incumbent WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero from Italy expires
at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body has missed three deadlines for a new
director-general since members failed to reach a consensus on
which of the four candidates would be the proper leader in the
future.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Agree on Bridging Arab Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan agreed on Tuesday
to exert their utmost to help settle Arab differences, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after a meeting between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King Abdullah in Egypt's
Sinai resort of Taba, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king will soon pay a visit to Syria, Moussa
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Jordan and Syria soured in 1994 after
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel. Syria insisted Arab
countries maintain a unified stance on the peace talks with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In a conciliatory move, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
traveled to Amman in February to mourn the death of the late
Jordanian King Hussein and had a meeting with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king arrived in Taba early in the day to
inaugurate with Mubarak a power grid connecting the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Abdullah also discussed the stalled Mideast peace
process, the possible declaration of a Palestinian state and the
bilateral ties, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
deadlocked since December when Israel shelved the Wye accord after
carrying out the first of the three-phased withdrawal from another
13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on several occasions
demonstrated his intention of declaring an independent Palestinian
state on May 4 when the interim Palestinian self-rule period
enshrined in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires regardless of the result
of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Mubarak and Abdullah pored over ways of
activating the bilateral relations in light of an agreement signed
last December on setting up a free trade zone, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with ways to promote joint investments and
tourism between the two countries, and the means to enhance
exchange of trade which stands at 150 million U.S. dollars
annually, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Resignation Blow for S. African Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The mass resignation of the
European Union's (EU) 20 commissioners on Tuesday has dealt a blow
to South Africa's hopes of concluding a key trade deal with the
bloc before the March deadline.
</P>
<P>
All EU commissioners resigned Tuesday after a panel of five
independent experts, appointed by the European Parliament, found
them liable for corruption and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
The quit of the commissioners, who run the day-to-day affairs
of the EU, places the 15-nation trade bloc in an institutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
EU officials went to great lengths on Tuesday to stress that
work on the South African-EU trade deal would go on, but said the
political impetus for finalizing the accord was certain to lose
some steam.
</P>
<P>
An EU spokeswoman said other officials busy with the
negotiations would carry on with their work.
</P>
<P>
The independent panel criticized, among others, Joao de Deus
Pinheiro, the commissioner responsible for Africa, for giving his
brother-in-law a top job in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro has been a key broker in the South African-EU trade
negotiations and was seeking a meeting with South African Trade
and Industry Minister Alec Erwin to try to resolve the latest
impasse ahead of the March 22 meeting of the EU Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Erwin and Pinheiro put together a draft trade deal in January
after almost four years of negotiations. The deal has been
approved by the South African cabinet, but rejected by five EU
states who considered the deal too generous to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The deal seeks to open the EU market to 95 percent of South
African exports over 10 years, while 86 percent of EU exports
would gain free access to the South African market over 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Civil Servant's Strike Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Strike by some 80,000 Israeli
civil servants entered the second day on Tuesday, bringing more
hardships to various government institutions, public and private
companies and common citizens.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was started Monday morning, paralyzed daily
business of all government and public institutions and cut off
half a million of telephone lines throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The management of the Bezeq, Israel's Largest telephone
company, said Tuesday that its staff still refused to fix the
"paralyzed" telephone system even after the Tel Aviv, Haifa and
the Ben Gurion International Airport were "out of order" on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve this problem, the Labor Court has ordered the
Bezeq management and its labor union to reach an agreement on the
wage issue by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange said the whole stock
market was paralyzed on Tuesday due to the strike. At the Ben
Gurion Airport, customs officials refused to work, and thousands
of passengers could not catch their planes on time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Federation is meeting in Tel Aviv Tuesday
to decide whether to ask about other 400,000 public sector workers
to stage a national general strike next week and the decision will
depend on government's position whether to agree with the
Federation's demand wage increase for workers of all sectors.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Minister Meri Sheetrit still blamed the
federation for organizing this strike, saying the federation "is
holding the public hostage in hopes of squeezing money out of the
government two months ahead of elections."
</P>
<P>
"That tactic would not work," he told the Israel Radio, adding
that "we do not politicize our economic policy."
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike, outpatient clinics in government hospitals
were closed, the Interior Ministry stopped to issue passports
and identity cards, the Customs Authority refused to release goods
waiting in the ports, and neither the courts nor the National
Insurance Institutes open to public.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long the strike will last, but the Civil
Service Commissioner Shumel Hollander has told the heads of
government offices that employees who do not work will not be
paid.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Finance Ministry on Sunday said it is
ready to deal with a long and difficult strike, given the Labor
Federation's excessive demands in public sector
collective-bargaining talks.
</P>
<P>
Sheetrit has agreed that the public-sector wages be adjusted
for inflation has a 3.8 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor Federation is demanding a sharp 16 percent
salary hike.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry's deputy spokesman Aviram Cohen said
Sunday that Sheetrit had given his assurance to protect
worker's salaries, but refuses to cave in to the outrageous
Federation demands for 16 percent wage hike.
</P>
<P>
Each percent is some 200 million U.S. dollars and if the
Finance Ministry gives in to their demands, it will lead to
the collapse of the entire economy.
</P>
<P>
Salary issue has become a major problem for the government.
Employees at the Defense Ministry started their strike last
week for wage increase.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Dismisses Wang Chengyong's Human Organ Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. court here on Monday
dismissed the case against a Chinese national for allegedly
selling human organs on the ground that the prosecutor was unable
to bring a key witness to the court.
</P>
<P>
In a 155-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Deborah Battis said
the prosecutor on behalf of the U.S. government failed to
investigate independently the reliability and credibility of Paul
Risenhoover, who made the case to the court.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot insulate its case by disavowing the one
individual who made the case and then led to the case being
brought to the government's attention," said Battis, who presided
over the case against Wang Chengyong.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing a trial to proceed in Paul Risenhoover's absence
would violate due process and the Sixth Amendment (of the U.S.
Constitution). Accordingly, the defendant's motion to dismiss the
indictment is granted," she said.
</P>
<P>
Holding a private passport, Wang Chengyong legally entered the
United States in May 1997. As he sought residency in the country,
he encountered "immigration attorney" Paul Risenhoover.
</P>
<P>
Making use of Wang's motive to attain a "Green Card",
Risenhoover made an attempt to induce him to join anti-Chinese
government organizations, but was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Then Risenhoover entrapped Wang to sign in New York in February
1998 a so-called Agreement on International Medical Studies
Service and Cooperation with Harry Wu, who disguised himself as "
Director Hong of Aruba Hospital of the Netherlands".
</P>
<P>
Later, Risenhoover, Harry Wu and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) worked together, talking with Wang many times
over the phone about "the sale of human organs". The FBI tape-
recorded the conversations and videotaped their meetings.
</P>
<P>
On February 20, 1998, the FBI arrested Wang and sued him for "
trading human organs".
</P>
<P>
As Risenhoover was absent, Wang's lawyer Oliver Smith presented
a motion to the court in mid-February for the dismissal of the
case.
</P>
<P>
Pleading innocent, Wang denied the charges from the beginning,
claiming it is a political trap.
</P>
<P>
Defending Wang, Smith told the court that Wang never agreed to
any activity that was illegal in the United States, and it was
Risenhoover himself that persisted in drawing the defendant
aggressively into the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Battis said "fairness requires the defendant to be
able to confront the man", referring to Risenhoover.
</P>
<P>
After the dismissal, Li Jingsheng, Wang's legal counsel and an
attorney from China, described the case as a political conspiracy
cooked up by Risenhoover and Harry Wu with an aim to frame Wang
and slander the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Li said Risenhoover was the mastermind of the case, as he
brought Wang to sign the "contract" and talked about the prices of
human organs with the purported "organ-requiring party".
</P>
<P>
Harry Wu has long been resorting to all sorts of dirty tricks
to create rumors against the Chinese government. Wu was sentenced
to 15 years in jail by a Chinese court and then expelled from
China for stealing, purchasing and illegally providing national
secrets to foreign organizations and posing as a staff of state
agencies. Wu has made use of Wang to reach his covert plot of
attacking the Chinese government, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Posing as a Dutch doctor, Li said, Wu tempted Wang into signing
a "contract" on the alleged human organ trading, exposing his mean
aim to the light of day. Immediately after Wang was arrested, Wu
directed his spearhead onto the Chinese government in the
interview with the U.S. press, Li said. Wu and his accomplices'
dirty deeds, however, are bound to failure, he said.

consumer inflation dropped to 8.6 percent in February from 8.9
percent in January, Statistics South Africa announced Tuesday.
</P>

However, the annual consumer price index increase in February

The core inflation, which excludes mortgage rates, volatile
food items and value-added tax, is 7.8 percent in February. The

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Tuesday called for "root-and-branch reform" of the European
Commission following the resignation of all its members.
</P>
<P>
"What we've got to do now is to use this event ...to drive
through root-and-branch reform in Europe," Blair said about the
mass resignation of the executive body of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"I think the decision of the European Commission was the only
decision they could possibly take," he told reporters, adding that
the resignation should be used to reform the entire bloc
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the whole of Europe is now ready for this message
because it is only by reforming the institutions in Europe and by
bringing them closer to people that we will build a successful
Europe for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the moment when we need to decide whether we're going
to leave Europe as it is or make the real reforms necessary for
the future."
</P>

The entire European Commission stepped down Monday night after
an independent report alleged that the commission is losing

<HEADLINE> Moi Demands World Efforts on Poverty Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya President Daniel arap Moi
Tuesday called for international efforts to reduce and eradicate
poverty, citing that unfair world trading practices put African
countries in an unfavorable position.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the delegates at the opening ceremony of the East
and Southern Africa Sub-regional Follow-up Conference to the
Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development, President Moi said
that the Copenhagen Declaration and Program of Action reaffirmed
the commitment of the international community to the reducing of
poverty, the achieving of full employment as well as the fostering
of just and stable societies.
</P>
<P>
Moi said poverty is a global problem requiring the concerted
efforts of the international community, adding that beyond the
region there is a need for strong international support and
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
The president said international organizations play "a critical
role" in the flow of assistance to African countries and "a vital
role" in mobilizing international opinion as well as providing
technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
"The picture is indeed gloomy in sub-Saharan Africa where
current projections indicate that unless we take urgent remedial
measures, Africa will remain as the only continent where poverty
levels will continue to rise in the next century," Moi said in his
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of employment is linked to poverty, adding
that regional economies, dominated by agriculture, has failed to
cope with the growing demand for employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The social service sector is equally bleak when this sub-region
has the lowest enrolment rates in basic education and also suffers
from low life expectancy, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Moi also emphasized that the decline in donor assistance and
the disasters such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic have worsened the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed his hope that the conference will consider ways
in which international organizations can play a more effective
role in reducing poverty in East and Southern African region.

BEIRUT, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss is to pay an official visit to Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) on Saturday on a mission to promote bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third visit Hoss has made to the Arab world
since he came to power in December, 1998. He visited Saudi Arabia
and Egypt last month.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the prime minister's palace said that Hoss will
spend a day in Qatar and another in Abu Dhabi for talks with the
two countries' leaders on ways of promoting investments in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with the leaders of the two oil-rich
Gulf nations the ongoing confrontation with Israel in its occupied
border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a total of seven Israelis, including a general,
were killed in south Lebanon in the ambushes launched by
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes and artillery forces pounded
villages and hills in the country's eastern and southern regions
for several days.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to evict Israeli occupation forces
and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Appeals to Donors for Reducing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
appealed to donors to assist communities to become self-reliant by
supporting community based projects aimed at reducing poverty and
foster social and economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local Government and Housing Minister, Bennie Mwiinga, said
Tuesday that community capacity building skills and other
community based organizations are critical in uplifting the
standard of living among the people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that local communities were endowed with both human
and material resources which could be harnessed and used in the
provision of infrastructure and other services in respective local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga said his ministry had mapped out a strategy of creating
 partnership with donors and other stake-holders in maximizing the
meagre resources for urban development and provide basic social
services for communities.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga also noted that the rapid rural-urban migration had
caused a high rate of urbanization which had placed severe
pressure on government's capacity to provide social services.
</P>
<P>
He said this in a speech read for him by deputy Minister of
Local Government and Housing, Bernard Mpundu, at the donor-funded
projects workshop held in Lusaka.

clear that it would modify the bill if Canadian and U.S. officials
could reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The Bill is designed to protect Canada's magazine industry by
keeping out so-called split-run magazines -- Canadian editions of
American magazines.
</P>
<P>
Split-runs are considered a threat as they cost considerably
less to produce than Canadian publications, and can therefore
charge less for advertising.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to retaliate against Canada's steel,
plastics, textiles and lumber industries if the bill is enacted.
It regards the legislation as protectionist and a transgression of
international trade laws.
</P>
<P>
But late last week, U.S. trade officials backed away from their
threats as Canada agreed to put all its protectionist magazine
policies, including C-55, on the table. Canadian and U.S.
officials are scheduled to meet Friday in Ottawa.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- As they could not reach
agreement with the management, the pilots of the Royal Nepal
Airlines Corporation (RNAC) continued their strike Tuesday,
stranding 1,000 passengers on international flights.
</P>
<P>
Thirty domestic flights and two-way flights from Kathmandu to
New Delhi, Hong Kong and Bangkok and one-way flight to Osaka were
canceled due to the strike, President of the Nepal Airlines
Pilots' Association Bijaya Giri said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven technicians, who were absent in the strike Monday,
joined the 87 pilots and 135 cabin crew members Tuesday in
demanding the cancellation of the agreement in leasing a Boeing
757 from the China Southwest Airlines, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pilots said that since 1994, the RNAC, the national flag
carrier of Nepal, has leased planes from foreign airlines for 12
times with an input of 90 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that with this amount of money, the RNAC can buy
two new planes. They said the two Boeing 757 planes of RNAC are
adequate for international flights.
</P>
<P>
Giri said that a loss of 14 million rupees (200,000 U.S.
dollars) was incurred in Tuesday's strike while it was 8 million
rupees (111,000 dollars) for Monday.

HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers
seized more than 350,000 suspected pirated optical discs worth 5.3
million HK dollars (680,000 U.S. dollars) in an operation against

During the major operation code-named "Thunderbolt", the

The on-going anti-piracy operation had successfully smashed

streets, said a spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions Likely to Hold Further Talks in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia and
the opposition are expected to hold further talks in April
somewhere inside Afghanistan, a senior United Nations official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Tesoriere, acting head of the U.N. Special Mission to
Afghanistan (UNSMA), hailed "the statement of agreement" in recent
talks between the warring Afghan factions as a "very important
step" at a press conference here Tuesday afternoon,
</P>
<P>
Tesoriere, who was present in the talks between the Taliban and
the opposition held on March 11-14 in Ashgabad, Turkmenistan, said
the venue for the next round of talks is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, he said that the two sides agreed in
the talks to share power but "there was no discussion on
Taqseem-e-Qudrat (division of power)."
</P>
<P>
"They have agreed to share institutions," he said in reference
to the joint statement issued following Ashgabad talks which says
the two sides agreed to form "a shared Executive, a shared
Legislature and a shared judiciary."
</P>
<P>
On the composition of the opposition delegation which included
representatives of only Ahmed Shah Masood, key anti-Taliban
commander, Tesoriere said both sides "spoke with full authority of
their respective leadership."
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides did not discuss military issues like
demilitarization in their Ashgabad talks.
</P>
<P>
On the representation of different ethnic groups in the future
Afghan set-up, Tesoriere said there was a great deal of discussion
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the UNSMA, the Taliban
and the opposition in their Ashgabad talks agreed to form a shared
government, release 20 prisoners each as soon as possible and hold
further talks to implement the decisions already reached.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabul Radio said Monday that the Taliban have only
agreed to hold more talks with the opposition and have not yet
decided to form a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The radio run by the militia also said that the Taliban and the
opposition have accepted a two-point peace accord that calls for a
cease-fire and for talks on a power-sharing formula.

LUANDA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) will extend a loan of 3 million U.S.
dollars to Cape Verde for developing projects in water
conservancy, sanitation and energy sectors, media reports said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The low-interest loan will be repaid in 17 years with a
subsequent five- year grace period, Deputy Prime Minister Luis
Silva said in the capital Praia recently, the Angolan official
News Agency Angog reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the World Bank had provided 10 million U.S. dollars of
loan for the projects, Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The projects will be mainly launched in the cities of Praia
and Santa Catarina on the country's largest island, Ilha de
Santiago, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has looked Cape Verde as a significant partner
and started to provide assistance to both public and private
projects after the country introduced market-oriented economic
reforms in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover privatization programs, infrastructure
construction, transport and health sectors as well as education
reforms.
</P>
<P>
A traditional agriculture country, the African island state in
the Atlantic is weak in industry. It is declared by the United
Nations as one of the least developed countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The government will submit a national program against poverty
to the parliament for deliberations and approval.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Inaugurate Joint Power Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Jordanian King Abdullah inaugurated on Tuesday the power
linkage project between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Abdullah launched the unified power grid on the
Egyptian side in the Sinai resort of Taba, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will launch later in the day the other section
of the unified power project on the Jordanian side at the Red Sea
city of Aqaba, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The project is a nucleus of a long-standing dream that the
power grids of the Arab countries will be linked to form a unified
one.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan were among the first Arab countries to realize
the importance of power linkage projects, Egyptian Minister of
Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The power linkage project, which cost 229 million U.S. dollars,
will help reduce the construction costs of new power plants in the
two countries, Abaza was quoted by MENA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan will supply power to each other all the time
through the unified grip, he said, adding that the move would help
develop the economies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Jordanian power linkage project is the main link
of a proposed regional project to unify the power grids of Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 megawatts of electricity can be exchanged between
Egypt and Jordan in the initial stage and the quantity will reach
350 megawatts after the power grids of Syria, Iraq and Lebanon are
connected with the existing one, Abaza said.
</P>
<P>
A unified Arab power grid is among the main elements that could
boost inter-Arab economic cooperation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar churned
lower Tuesday, shedding more than two thirds of a U.S. cent as it
again fell victim to sinking commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading in Sydney Tuesday, the Australian
dollar was buying 62.64 U.S. cents from 63.32 U.S. cents at the
close Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the day it hit a high of 62.94 U.S. cents and fell to a
low of 62.61 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices plunged by more than 5.00 U.S. dollars Monday night
and a leading commodity index receded, said Westpac Banking Corp.
chief dealer for foreign exchange Peter McGrath.
</P>
<P>
He said the sell-off in gold was triggered by talk of gold
sales by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac Monday night told the
Inter-American Development Bank's annual meeting in Paris that the
International Monetary Fund should raise funds by selling some of
its gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading in New York Tuesday morning (Australian
Eastern Daylight Time) COMEX gold for current delivery was at
286.80 U.S. dollars an ounce, down by 5.80 U.S. dollars on the
previous close.
</P>
<P>
"The Aussie tracks gold prices pretty closely so that's been
the main driver," McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
He said the euro currency suffered Tuesday after the
resignation Monday night of all 20 members of the European Union
Executive Commission.
</P>
<P>
The resignation followed a report on top-level cronyism and
fraud.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading Tuesday the Australian dollar was
buying 0.5788 euro from 0.5800 Monday, while the euro was trading
at 1.0824 U.S. dollars from 1.0918 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 73.62 Japanese yen from
75.06 yen.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Official Calls For Halt In Declining Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Trade Minister
Shi Guangsheng on Tuesday asked all trade officials and major
export companies to try every possible way to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
China's exports declined for the first two months of the year.
Shi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, told a
televised conference on exports that all trade departments need to
follow the decision reached by the second session of the 9th
National People's Congress and the conference on foreign trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China faces a very hard situation. In the first
two months, exports declined 10.5 percent from the same period of
last year to 22.4 billion US dollars worth.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to move forward against difficulties to
increase exports to ensure growth in exports this year to
contribute to sustained, rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
To combat the decline, China will adopt a system this year to
assess the performance of export companies and their foreign
currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
Those that do badly will have quotas reduced, exhibition
attendance restricted, certain bidding rights revoked, and in some
cases have import and export licenses revoked, he announced.
</P>
<P>
In January, Shi said that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) will introduce a series of measures
to encourage exports, which have become increasingly important for
national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
These will cover structural reforms in the foreign trade system,
cultivation of new growth areas, the adoption of a hi-tech
strategy, and installation of overseas assembly lines with Chinese
equipment and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
China's exports grew 0.5 percent last year in spite of the
worsening Asian financial crisis. General exports amounted to 183.
76 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> 5 killed, 100 Injured in U.S. Train Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed and 100 injured in a train accident at a crossing in
Illinois State of the United States Monday night, said reports
reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A train slamming into a truck loaded with steel bars at the
crossing caused several cars and engines to derail and started a
fire.
</P>
<P>
Mike Harshberger, fire chief in Bourbonnais, a town about 80
kilometers south of Chicago, told a press conference that most of
the victims were in a sleeping car near the front of the train.
There were 101 people injured.
</P>
<P>
Harshberger said that there were 214 people on the train and
of those 188 had been accounted for at hospitals or shelters. That
leaves perhaps 20 to 25 missing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operation continued to search inside the wreckage for
about 20 people still missing. Some 200 emergency workers were on
the scene, climbing on top of the overturned cars and working
through twisted metal to rescue trapped passengers.
</P>
<P>
The train's engines and passenger cars were scattered over the
tracks, with smoke pouring from the wreckage two hours after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
The train, consisting of two engines and 14 passenger cars, was
bound for New Orleans from Chicago. The collision occurred around
9:40 p.m. (local time).

<HEADLINE> HK Considers Off-loading Government-held Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ti-liang Yang, chairman of EFIL, announced here Tuesday that
EFIL, founded to manage the government portfolio, considered that
"it is necessary to pursue a combination of disposal methods
including possible share placements, unitization, exchangeable
bonds and corporate share buybacks".
</P>
<P>
He said: "We will need to adopt a flexible approach in terms of
timing, methods and size of disposal, bearing in mind the primary
objective of avoiding causing disruption to the stability of the
market throughout the process."
</P>
<P>
The SAR government acquired 118 billion HK dollars (15 billion
U.S. dollars) worth of Hong Kong blue-chips last August in a
showdown with international speculators, who double-played in
local stock and currency markets.
</P>
<P>
Yang revealed that EFIL has chosen three firms as financial
advisers, who will primarily assist in the design and
implementation of the disposal plan for the Hong Kong Equity
Portfolio. The names of these institutions will be announced later,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech earlier this month, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang announced a five-percent allocation to Hong Kong
equities as a long-term investment for the Exchange Fund. EFIL has
been requested to manage the Hong Kong Equity Portfolio through
external managers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the question of proxy voting, Yang said that EFIL
considered it very important to strike the right balance between
non-interference with the day-to-day commercial activities of the
companies and the need to safeguard the government's interest as a
responsible minority shareholder.

<HEADLINE> 570,000 Chinese Tourists Visit Thailand In 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- There were 570,000 Chinese who
visited Thailand in 1998, a third more than in 1997, a top Thai
tourist official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Seree Wangpaichitr, the head of the Thai Bureau of Tourism, who
is making a promotion tour of China, says that Thailand has become
the primary foreign destination for Chinese, and the number of
Chinese visiting Thailand has been rising for a decade, except for
the years 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Seree is in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, with the
managers of 8 leading Thai travel agencies. The 1999 World
Horticulture Exhibition will open in Kunming later this year and
he says he hopes to join hands with Chinese counterparts to get
more tourists at the event to visit Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chinese tourists can reach Thailand on a number of flights and
even by the Lancang River, known as the Mekong in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Bureau of Tourism has established an office in Hong
Kong and plans to open more in Beijing, Shanghai, and Kunming.
Thai authorities are also planning to simplify customs procedures
for Chinese tourists.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Marginally Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
closed at another record high Tuesday but weakness in the
resources sector meant the market failed to reach the 3000-point
barrier.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index gained 2.7 points by the close to
2,992.2, a new closing high.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index added 14.1 points to 5,397.4 but the
all resources index lost 9.3 points to 1,020.7.
</P>
<P>
The overall market came within four points of the 3000-point
mark, peaking at a record 2,996.3, but weakness in key stocks,
particularly Commonwealth Bank of Australia, staved off the
anticipated afternoon rally.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover on the day was 380.7 million shares traded worth
772.35 million U.S. dollars with 683 falling stocks, 571 rising
and 451 steady.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which accounts for just
under five percent of the all ordinaries index, shed 87.4 cents,
or 3.3 percent, to 25.78 Australian dollars Tuesday as its share
buyback offer drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
The bank's slump offset rises in the other major banks and
resulted in the subindex ending 18.7 points down at 7,003.6.
</P>
<P>
ANZ bank gained 17 cents to 10.99 Australian dollars, National
Australia Bank put on 9.5 cents to 28.49 Australian dollars and
Westpac bank accelerated 4.8 cents to 10.94 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The resources sector was led down by weakness in leader BHP,
the biggest industrial company in Australia, and a particularly
soft gold sector following bullion's slump.
</P>
<P>
The gold index tumbled 39.9 points or 3.9 percent to 1,034.4 as
the price of gold bullion was trading in Sydney at 286.00 U.S.
dollars per fine ounce.
</P>
<P>
In the broader resources sector, the losers included BHP which
gave up 15.5 cents to 12.595 Australian dollars.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Foreign Currency Reserve Up to 53 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The total foreign reserve includes the deposits at overseas
branches of South Korean banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed increasing foreign currency holding
to another current account surplus and additional inflow of
foreign capital by corporate and financial restructuring in the
first 15 days of March.
</P>
<P>
The growing foreign reserve has been on rise since South Korea
borrowed 58 billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary
Fund at the end of 1997 after the country was struck by unexpected
financial turmoil caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans
of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The nation registered seven billion U.S. dollars in November
1997.
</P>
<P>
The rise is expected to continue in the first half of 1999, but
in the second half, it will slow down due to outstanding payments
to creditors, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Re-asserts Claim of Sovereignty Over Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday reiterated its claim
of sovereignty over the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and
Lesser Tunbs in the Gulf, saying they are inseparable parts of
Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi made the
remarks after the Gulf states called on Iran Monday to settle
its dispute with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the three
strategic islands.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the only way to settle the existing
"misunderstanding" between Iran and the UAE is to hold bilateral
talks, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on
Monday urged Iran to peacefully solve the dispute with the UAE
through direct international negotiations or by resorting to the
international courts of justice.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states reiterated their support for the UAE's
sovereignty over the three disputed islands at the mouth of the
strategic Hormoz Strait.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands in 1971 after the British forces
pulled out from the region. However, both Tehran and Abu Dhabi
claimed sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Iran insisted on bilateral talks to
solve the issue, but the UAE called for an international
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The UAE recently lodged protest to Iran's move to build
infrastructural facilities and launch military maneuvers near the
Abu Musa island.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman urged the UAE government to accept
bilateral talks within the framework of the 1971 accord between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He argued that Iran has the absolute right to stage military
maneuvers for defensive purposes and in line with the territorial
integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Asefi also called on the GCC states to promote relations,
mutual trust and dialog with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hardline Iranian daily Jomhuri Islami (Islamic
Republic) called on the Iranian government to reconsider its
policies towards the UAE and recall its ambassador from Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded commentary, the paper lashed out at the UAE
government for what it called the UAE's "hostile stance" towards
Iran and said that Iran should break off "all commercial and
touristic ties with this tiny country."

<HEADLINE> Manila Says PAL Plan Unlikely to Break Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The proposed sale of 90 percent of
the assets of the Philippine Airlines (PAL) is not likely to
violate the Constitution which limits foreign ownership of public
utilities, including airlines, to a maximum of 40 percent, a
government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora clarified that what is up for sale was neither the
country's flag carrier nor its stockholdings, but some of its
assets.
</P>
<P>
"That plan of theirs is really a plan to sell assets, and that
does not really involve the stockholdings of the corporation
itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought the PAL proposal would violate the
country's charter, he said, "probably not."
</P>
<P>
PAL submitted this new rehabilitation plan Monday to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected to act on
the proposal by April 15.
</P>
<P>
The airline has suffered financial losses in past few years and
shut down operation in September last year after a prolonged
strike.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming approval of a subsequent referendum allowed it
to resume operation in October.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Cut Back Crude Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's crude oil output has been
slashed further by 148,000 barrels per day (bpd) as member nations
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are
expected to reach an agreement to curb the prolonged slump in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
An OPEC ministerial meeting scheduled on March 23 is to ratify
a new cutback deal jointly proposed by Iran, Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Algeria and Mexico after March 11-12 meeting at the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The proposed accord stipulated 2.029 million bpd of crude oil
production cuts over some three million bpd of existing cutback
commitments by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the accord, Saudi Arabia will cut its output
by 585, 000 bpd, Iran by 264,000 bpd and Kuwait by 144,000 bpd
while Qatar planned to shed 47,000 bpd, the United Arab Emirate by
an extra 100,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The output cut by Nigeria meant that the government's revenue
projection from crude oil exports this year has been slashed by
205 million U.S. dollars from the total 6.379 billion dollars
income expected, according to a Daily Times report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But, the paper said, Nigeria's oil income may still remain
within budget levels or surpass it as oil prices are soaring above
government's projection of nine dollars per barrel.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's largest Fertilizer Factory Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Production at the Jamuna Fertilizer
Factory has remained suspended since last Saturday night due to
shortage of water supply from Jamuna river, the New Nation daily
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sudden fall in the flows of Jamuna river caused the production
shutdown at the country's largest fertilizer factory, the report
quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the latest disruption, production at the factory was
halted four times within a span of two months, and the factory has
already incurred about 500 million taka (about 10.3 million U.S.
dollars) in revenue loss due to production suspension, they said.
</P>
<P>
The factory having a capacity of producing 1,700 tons of urea
per day stopped production at a time when the farmers across the
country were badly in need of the input.
</P>
<P>
Now, the authorities are taking all measures to resume
production at the factory as early as possible, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Property Sector Expects Mild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's property market
is expected to stage a mild recovery at the end of this year after
the slowdown in the last two years with 1998 recording the lowest
number of transactions, according to the projection of a latest
property market.
</P>
<P>
The property sector in Malaysia was one of the sectors worst
hit by the prevailing regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The recovery would take place against a backdrop of prices and
volumes remaining moderate, the Valuation and Property Services
Department said in its 1998 Property Market Report released here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The optimism was attributed to the good infrastructure and
stable institutions which should ensure the sustainability of its
economic recovery program in the medium to long term.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the total number of property transactions recorded was
32.3 percent lower than 1997, the lowest in the past seven years,
with transactions in the residential sector dropping by 30
percent, the commercial sector by 44.1 percent, the industrial
sector by 48.1 percent, the agricultural sector by 22.1 percent
and the development sector by 47.4 percent, according to official
estimates.
</P>
<P>
While total values transacted in the year under review shrunk
by 47.8 percent, the lowest in the past five years, compared with
a small increase of 6.6 percent in 1997, with total values
transacted in the residential sector falling by 36 percent, the
commercial sector by 43.9 percent, the industrial sector by 55.5
percent, the agricultural sector by 47.7 percent and the
development land sector by 72.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
To prop up the sector and to boost lending by banks, the
government relaxed the policy on financing for the property sector
in the third quarter of 1998, compared with the restriction on
property loans in the previous quarters within the same year.
</P>
<P>
The government also launched last December a month long "Home
Ownership Campaign" to sell unsold properties of 5 billion ringgit
(about 1.315 billion U.S. dollars) at significant discounts to the
house buyer.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was quite successful for landed residential
properties as more than 14,000 houses worth 3.8 billion ringgit
(about 1 billion U.S. dollars) were sold during the campaign, but
commercial and industrial properties were still hard to dispose
despite the hard sell.
</P>
<P>
Since the last quarter of 1998, the property sector in general
has begun to show signs that it had passed through its most
difficult period.
</P>
<P>
As Deputy Finance Minister Wong See Wah disclosed here Monday,
the residential sector, the worst of the recession in the first
half of 1998, recorded a positive improvement in the last quarter
of 1998, the first in the 12-month period, when the number of
transactions increased by 3.5 percent and its value of
transactions rose by 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the entire property sector, the transactions in the last
quarter of 1998 showed a 0.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
"Although this growth is relatively small, such improvement is
indeed encouraging as it indicates that the government-implemented
policies have started to bear their fruits," the deputy minister
said.
</P>
<P>
A positive increase in demand for residential sector was also
noted in the first month of 1999 and the residential property
market forecasts all indicate a more favorable year ahead with
affordable residential properties continuing to be popular.
</P>
<P>
However, it was forecast that it would take two years for "full
confidence" to return to the real property market because the
amount of excess space in the office and retail sectors would take
at least two years to clear, and the banking sector also would
take at least two years to write off bad loans, restructure and
recapitalize themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Valuation and Property Services Department said the growth
in the real property market would reflect developments in the
national economy.

CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan welcomes the summit Tuesday
between Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, calling it "a big stride" in promoting Arab joint
action.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio, Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh said the summit in Egypt's
Sinai resort of Taba is "a big stride on the road of collective
Arab action."
</P>
<P>
Al-Rawabdeh was quoted by the Cairo-based radio as saying that
the inauguration by the two leaders of a power linkage project
between the two countries mirrors their keenness on securing joint
interests.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Abdullah arrived Tuesday morning in Taba, where
they will launch the joint power grid on the Egyptian side. Later
in the day, the two leaders will travel to Jordan's Red Sea city
of Aqaba to inaugurate the project on the Jordanian side.
</P>
<P>
The power linkage project is aimed at ensuring power supply in
the two countries. It will also help reduce costs of setting up
new power generation stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak and Abdullah will hold talks on the Middle
East peace process and bilateral cooperation in various fields.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Have Free Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The first free-access
Internet service in South Africa is to be launched next month,
which could lead to a shake-up for the country's cut-throat
Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
The Britain-based X-Stream, whose 232,000 customers make it one
of Britain's top five Internet service providers, said its zero
cost service would make it by far the largest dial-up service
provider in South Africa, Business Day paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new service is being tested by about 200 users, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of South Africa's existing 100-plus service providers are
still losing money after pumping vast sums into their networks and
battling for subscription fees and advertising revenue. The new
arrival could propel many into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
South African companies expressed doubts about the success
chance of a free service. They said there are too few advertisers
to generate a profit.
</P>
<P>
However, X-Stream director Chirinjeev Kathuria said the
company's experience in Britain had proved the viability of such
move. After its launch last March, the company quickly became a
top-five player and forced others to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"Paid-for service providers are not going to exist for long,"
Kathuria said.

<HEADLINE> China Wishes '9+3' Meeting on Finance A Success: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China hopes the upcoming regional
meeting on finance could be a success, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi here this afternoon at the routine press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Key participants in the meeting, scheduled to be held in
Vietnamese capital Hanoi coming Thursday, include vice financial
ministers and vice central bank governors from nine member states
of the Associations of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus
corresponding officials from China, Japan and the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, known as "9+3 meeting" on finance, will focus on
short-term capital flow monitoring and issues on international
financial system reform.
</P>
<P>
China's Vice Finance Minister Jin Liqun and Vice Governor of
the People's Bank of China Xiao Gang will lead the Chinese
delegation to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The convening of the "9+3 meeting" on finance was proposed by
Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao at the second informal summit of
East Asian countries held last December. ASEAN members, Japan and
ROK all made active response to the proposal. The convening of the
meeting reflected the "willingness of these countries to enhance
cooperation and exchanges," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the meeting is aimed at "strengthening dialogue and
policy coordination among East Asian countries and exchanging
views on the current financial and economic issues with a view to
expanding consensus and enhancing cooperation in the monetary and
economic fields."
</P>
<P>
"The meeting can be mentioned in parallel with other
international financial forums and organizations," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Sun described the monitoring of short-term capital flow on the
agenda of the first meeting as "the most protruding and imperative
" issue that affects the economic and financial stability in the
region. The issue is also most concerned by the East Asian
countries and should be given top priority to, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
East Asia, as the region that has seriously affected by the
financial crisis, needs to strengthen the studies on reforming the
international financial systems and make public their own ideas
and suggestions so as to contribute their share to the
international financial system reform, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China holds the meeting is in the interest of all countries in
the region and in conformity with the needs to advance cooperation,
Sun said, adding that it could also "add something substantial" to
the '9+3' informal meeting of East Asian leaders. China believes
the meeting would exert positive impact on further stabilizing the
regional economic and financial situation.

-- Drawing the conclusion of a report which very severely
criticized nepotism in the European Commission, the president of
the commission Jacques Santer announced early Tuesday morning that
the whole commission had decided with unanimity to resign. The
French commissioner Edith Cresson held a heavy responsibility in
the affair.

<P>
-- Western countries are now putting all their pressure on
Belgrade after the delegation of Kosovo Albanians announced on
Monday that they are ready to sign the draft peace agreement on
Kosovo which was prepared by the international community. The
talks on Kosovo which resumed after a three-week interruption were
thus opened by a significant breakthrough.

Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The president of the European Commission Jacques Santer
announced early Tuesday morning that all the 20 commissioners
would resign after a wise men's report accused them of ``having
lost control'' of their administration. French commissioner Edith
Cresson was most severely criticized by the five wise men for
favoritism and mismanagement in the handling of a file concerning
a training program.
</P>
<P>
-- One of the two bars which blocked the talks on Kosovo over
the past one month was finally jumped over. On the first day of
the resumption of talks on Kosovo in Paris on Monday, the Kosovo
Albanian delegation accepted the draft agreement of the
international community on a substantial autonomy of the Yugoslav
province. The signing of the agreement by Albanians is expected on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Plane Breaks Air Ban, Carries Pilgrims to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi plane carrying 110 Iraqi
pilgrims took off from Baghdad Tuesday morning, heading for the
holy shrines in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, where pilgrims will perform
rituals of hadj.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from the Rasheed airport, a military
airport in southern Baghdad. Iraqi Minister of Endowment and
Religious Affairs Abdul Munem Ahmed Saleh was also on board.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Iraq broke the air ban imposed on
the country after the 1991 Gulf War. In 1997, an Iraqi plane
carrying Iraq's elderly pilgrims flew to Jeddah airport in
southwestern Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, nearly 2,000 Iraqi pilgrims left for Saudi Arabia
for the hadj, the first group from Iraq to perform the annual
Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca this year.
</P>
<P>
Aladdin al-Qaisi, an adviser at the Ministry of Endowment said
that another 2,000 pilgrims are expected to leave Baghdad on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of over 22 million, can send up to
22,000 pilgrims to Mecca under quotas set by the Organization of
the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Qaisi said the Iraqi pilgrims had to perform the hadj at their
own expenses because of financial constraints caused by the
U.N. sanctions imposed on the country in 1990 following its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Sunday accused the U.S. and
British representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of
impeding efforts to try to help Iraqis perform their pilgrimage
by rejecting the Iraqi proposal for using its frozen assets in
foreign countries to finance its pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 3,000 Iraqi pilgrims made the trip to Mecca to
perform hadj. In 1997, Iraq flew a planeload of pilgrims to
Mecca and other pilgrims were flown by helicopters to the
Iraqi-Saudi border despite a ban on flights over Iraq enforced by
the U.S. and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Expects 3 Percent Economic Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic growth
rate is expected to be as high as 3 percent this year following
signs that the country has entered the recovery phase of the
economic crisis, First Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy started to bottom out in the third
quarter of last year when real gross domestic product had
contracted by 8.6 percent on an annual basis, said Daim, who is
also special functions minister, in Kuching, Sarawak, East
Malaysia, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest indicators, the Malaysian economy would
continue to register positive growth, Daim said, citing the
rebound by 75 percent in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite
Index since last September to March 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the country had chalked up a trade surplus of 58.4
billion ringgit (15.368 billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's trade surplus continued to grow by 4.3 billion
ringgit (1.131 billion dollars) in January this year, which was
the 15th consecutive month that exports exceeded imports
</P>
<P>
Daim said Bank Negara (State Bank)'s international reserves,
which rose to 108 billion ringgit (28.421 billion dollars) as of
February 15 this year from 56 billion ringgit (14.736 billion
dollars) at the end of June last year, had already exceeded the
National Economic Recovery Plan's target of five months' retained
imports.
</P>
<P>
He said in the financial sector, the three-month intervention
rate was reduced from 11 percent to 6.5 percent, which enabled the
business sector to operate at reasonable cost and improve their
ability to service their existing loans.
</P>
<P>
The non-performing loans ratio of the banking system was well
under control with total loans registered in December at 9.0
percent, based on the six-month classification, he said.
</P>
<P>
Total loans approved by the banking system picked up to 9.9
billion ringgit (2.605 billion dollars) in December last year from
2.7 billion ringgit (710 million dollars) in May.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate fell to 5.2 percent in January this year from a
peak of 6.2 percent last June.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment of workers also declined to 5,137 in December
last year from a peak of 12,335 in July with unemployment rate
estimated at 5.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Daim said despite fears expressed by critics of Malaysia's
capital controls introduced last September, there was no evidence
of leakage from the capital account or black marketing for the
ringgit.

<HEADLINE> China's First Blood Transfusion on Tiger Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A critically-ill Siberian tiger in
south China has recovered from severe anemia after receiving a
successful blood transfusion in at a wildlife medical facility a
week ago. This was the first such procedure ever performed on a
tiger in China.
</P>
<P>
The six-year old male tiger, which was raised in the Bear and
Tiger Breeding Mountain Village in Guilin, the famous picturesque,
tourist city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
was large and healthy before it contracted a tick disease last
year, a common ailment among wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The disease caused anemia, and the tiger began to become
emaciated and its fur began to fall out.
</P>
<P>
Various methods were tried in an attempt to treat the disease
such as blood-building drugs to eliminate the ticks in the tiger's
abdomen, but nothing seemed to help and the tiger's life was in
danger.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians then began to collect compatible blood samples
from healthy tigers to prepare for a blood transfusion. On the
afternoon of March 4, a transfusion of 800 cc of fresh blood was
given to the animal, a procedure taking three hours.
</P>
<P>
Now the tiger has regained its appetite and its claws and
tongue have regained their ruddy color.
</P>
<P>
The Bear and Tiger Village is a medical center and a breeding
base for wildlife which was approved by the State Forestry Bureau
in 1997. Last year, 47 tiger cubs of different breeds were born at
the center, which represents the highest survival rate for tigers
among all of China's animal breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
China previously has done successful blood transfusions for
treating tick disease in orangutans.

<HEADLINE> China's Automobile-Leasing Market Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China' car-leasing market has
great potential as the ratio of this sector's total turnover to
the capital market is less than one percent of that of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted in 28 Chinese cities, the total
income of automobile-leasing companies in these cities was
estimated at 240 million yuan (30 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
These cities average 31 car-leasing companies each, with each
company operating 136 cars with total annual turnover of about 7.
65 million yuan, and profits standing at 1.5 million, on average.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe China's car-leasing industry is promising
because many government departments are now turning to leasing
rather than purchase cars for officials, and more and more Chinese
people, most of whom can't afford to buy a car now, are learning
how to drive, so they are potential car renters.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Technologies to Substitute Oil with Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Developing the technology that
will allow replacing oil with coal is a long-tern strategy for
China, according to the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
By next year, China's crude oil output will reach 165 million
tons, up 16 million tons from 1995. However, China's oil reserves
are not sufficient to meet the demands of rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's growing demand for oil will show a rise of five to six
million tons annually during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China is the largest coal producer in the
world, with large reserves. If the technology can be developed to
liquefy coal and to manufacture a water and coal solution, this
will help alleviate China's oil shortage.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission has established a
special office to develop such technology.

<HEADLINE> Exports Through Shanghai Customs Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's exports to other parts
of Asia through Shanghai customs hit 2.437 billion U.S. dollars in
the first two months this year, up 24.4 percent over the same
period last year, customs figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
An analysis shows that exports to Japan rose 15 percent in the
first two months, and were up 4.1 percent to Malaysia, up 68.8
percent to the Philippines, up 49.9 percent to Thailand, and up
more than 100 percent to the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
However, exports to Indonesia and Singapore continued to
decline in January and February.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that exports to Europe and North
America jumped 15.2 percent and 80.9 percent, respectively, in the
first two months.
</P>
<P>
Exports in general trade rose 22.5 percent to 2.58 billion U.S.
dollars in the first two months, partly due to a hike in the
export rebate rate for machinery, electronics and textiles
effective January 1.
</P>
<P>
Total exports and imports through Shanghai customs reached 5.
17 billion U.S. dollars and 3.29 billion U.S. dollars in the first
two months this year, up 31.4 percent and 9.2 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that a 13.9 percent decline in imports of
materials for manufacturing enterprises in the first two months
may have a negative impact on exports later this year.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the Asian financial crisis, imports of equipment to
be used in foreign-funded enterprises coming through Shanghai
customs plunged 31.9 percent to 395 million U.S. dollars in the
first two months.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Games Chief Unconcerned by EU Boycott Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic chief Michael
Knight on Tuesday dismissed a threat by a German government
minister that the 15 European Union countries might boycott the
Sydney 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
Otto Schily, Germany's interior minister who is also in charge
of the sports affairs, said a boycott might be needed if the
corruption-tainted International Olympic Committee (IOC) failed to
put its house in order.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the threat at a public occasion in Melbourne,
Knight, president of organizing committee SOCOG and New South
Wales state Olympics minister, said: "I don't treat it seriously
at all.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone that wants to make a little bit of political capital or
a name for themselves anywhere in Australia or internationally
only have to raise the boycott word to get themselves a run in the
media. It's not going to happen," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Backing in Germany, Schily was also attacked by German Olympic
Committee president Walther Troeger, who warned the German
government against meddling in sports politics.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental decision about the participation of German
sports in an international competition does not fall into the
responsibilities of the government," Troeger said.
</P>
<P>
Knight declined to comment on whether Australian IOC member
Phil Coles would resign from the SOCOG board. Coles has been
under pressure to quit the SOCOG board since the weekend when the
IOC gave him a "most serious warning" for accepting several paid
holidays from Salt Lake City Olympic organizers. But he is
eligible to stay in the SOCOG board so long as he remains an IOC
member.

<HEADLINE> Poland Interested in Joining ASEM: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Poland is extremely
interested in participating in the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM),
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his country's desire when delivering a
lecture here on "European Security and Regional Cooperation:
Poland's Perspective" at Malaysia's Institute of Diplomacy and
Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
Describing ASEM as an important process, vital to both
continents and the entire world, the president said it "should not
create the impression of a closed private club."
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, on his first state visit to Malaysia, said
Poland's accomplishments justify its participation in the process.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said Poland is extremely interested in "developing
relations with Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
ASEM currently involves 25 Asian and European countries, which
had its first summit in Bangkok, Thailand in 1996, and the second
one in London last year.
</P>
<P>
Poland, which has become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), is also well on its way to join the European
Union with full membership status expected by end of 2002, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Poland perceives NATO as a common force in defense of
common values. We regard our entry as a return to where we
belong."
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski also briefed the attendants of Poland's economy
which he said had shown "excellent" results thanks to reform
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Polish president arrived here Monday for a three-day state
visit to Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> EU Faces Crisis after Executive Arm Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) suddenly
tumbled into crisis before a summit in Berlin on budget reforms as
its executive arm stepped down en masse after being under fire
from an independent report on wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
A 144-page report from the EU Committee of Independent Experts
accused commissioners of corruption and cronyism, including
irregularities in managing humanitarian aid, tourism, vocational
training and other programs.
</P>
<P>
On January 14, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on
improving financial management of the commission, calling for a
committee of independent experts to be convened under the auspices
of the parliament and the commission.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was an unprecedented Waterloo the European
Commission, the executive, had ever met since it took office on
January 7, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The commission has so far during its term made every effort to
push ahead with the EU's integration in 15 member states. But it
had trouble just days after the launch of the euro which is now in
use in 11 EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, the commissioner responsible for agriculture,
said the commission's authority had been undermined. "Europe
cannot function without an effective and credible commission which
enjoys the confidence of the other institutions and of European
citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that it needs time to revitalize the bloc'
s misgoverned bureaucracy. And for the EU as a whole, the event
will push the euro to a new low, shadowing its already sluggish
economy.
</P>
<P>
The commission's president Jaques Santer was expected to meet
the current EU rotating presidency, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, in Brussels later Tuesday to evaluate the impact of the
move on the ongoing reforms of EU farm and regional aid programs,
part of a package known as Agenda 2000 in EU jargon. The Agenda
2000 is prepared for embracing a dozen of central and east
European countries in early next century.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU treaty, the outgoing commission would continue in
a caretaker capacity with its present powers of proposing
legislation until the 15 EU member states appoint a new team.
</P>
<P>
So far, Britain has said it would seek the reappointment of its
two commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan and Neil Kinnock, neither of
whom was involved in the corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the 626-seat European Parliament, who
earlier called on the commission to step down or face being sacked,
welcomed the resignation and called for an urgent EU summit to
appoint a new EU executive arm in order to settle the union's
short period crisis.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Greening Project Along Major Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A project to draw donations from
society to green the vast valleys of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers
was recently launched jointly by the Central Committee of the
Chinese Youth League, the National Greening Committee, the
Ministry of Water Resources, the State Forestry Administration and
the China Youth Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The project, called "Protecting Mother Rivers Green Project
Hope", will fully apply the experience gained from the Project
Hope, which began nine years ago and is aimed at helping poor drop-
outs to return to school.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that during the past nine years
Project Hope has received 1.61 billion yuan (nearly 200 million U.
S. dollars) in donations, helped 2.09 million kids, and set up 7,
111 primary schools.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that through this project we can do something to stop
the flooding of the Yangtze and prevent the Yellow River from
running dry," said a senior staff member of the China Youth
Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
He said that a donation of only five yuan (about 60 U.S. cents)
is enough to plant one tree, and that 200 yuan (about 25 U.S.
dollars) will enable the planting of one mu (about 0.07 hectares)
of forest.
</P>
<P>
All donations will be conducted through the China Youth
Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 100 Chinese media outlets have agreed to
publicize the project.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Grants MFN Status to U.S., Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has granted the
most-favored-nation (MFN) status to the United States and Japan,
Vietnam's English daily the Saigon Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Goods originating from the United States and Japan will enjoy
preferential tariffs under the MFN status when entering Vietnam,
the paper quoted the Ministry of Trade as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued on March 10 and another one on
March 12, any surplus import duty on shipments cleared since
January 1 will be refunded, the Saigon Times said.
</P>
<P>
The preferential tariffs will be effective for one year on a
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan has not signed a trade agreement yet with
Vietnam, it has granted Vietnam preferential status under the
Generalized System of Preferences, with 2,700 lines of
preferential taxes of Japan's total 9,000 import-export tax lines.
</P>
<P>
Japan is now Vietnam's largest official development assistance
donor, and also a large trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The United States has not signed a trade agreement with
Vietnam, nor granted the most-favored-nation status to Vietnam, so
it still taxes Vietnamese imports heavily.
</P>
<P>
The seventh round of talks on the Vietnam-U.S. trade agreement
began in Hanoi from Monday.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Trade Up Following 7-Month Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- After seven consecutive months of
decline, a brisk export pushed up the trade of the Philippines for
January 1999 by 0.5 percent to 4.976 billion U.S. dollars from
4.953 billion dollars a year earlier, the National Statistics
Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's export in January 1999 went up by 22.0 percent,
the highest growth since March 1998, to 2.581 billion dollars from
2.115 billion dollars a year earlier, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that the import fell by 15.6 percent to
2.395 billion dollars from 2.838 billion dollars during the
period.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for almost 26.5 percent of the aggregate value of
the January 1999 imports, electronics and components topped the
imports during the period, it said.
</P>
<P>
Payments for electronics and components rose by 12.2 percent to
635.59 million dollars in January 1999 from 566.38 million dollars
last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunication equipment and electrical machinery ranked
second with payments dropping by 31.8 percent to 195.39 million
dollars in January 1999 from 286.44 million dollars a year
earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
The United States remained the country's top supplier of
imported goods valued at 531.15 million dollars, which was 22.2
percent of the total import payment, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, accounting for 20.2 percent of the total bill, came out
as the second biggest source of foreign-made commodities during
the period.

<HEADLINE> EA Passport to Cover East and Central Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The East African passport
scheduled to be issued on April 1may be transformed into a travel
document to cover other countries in East and Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Francis Muthaura of the East African
Cooperation (EAC) said here Monday that the regional secretariat
intended to strengthen the role of the passport which is meant to
facilitate the travel of people between the borders of the three
EAC member states.
</P>
<P>
EAC hopes the document can be endorsed at the respective
immigration departments in the three states of Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania to enable holders travel to regional countries outside
the bloc, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura said that immigration officers would be authorized to
add other names, including Zambia, the Democratic Republic of
Congo and others yet to be listed.
</P>
<P>
The heads of states of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda agreed in
Arusha last month to sign the treaty establishing the Eastern
African Community (EAC) in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura noted that the national passports would eventually be
phased out in favor of the EA passport to be launched as the only
travel document in the region, which would happen once full
political and economic union is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Once the treaty on the EAC is signed in July, the zero rate
tariff would be introduced, he said, adding that products bough in
any of the three countries would be exempted from custom duty.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretary-general said, duty on goods would
attract a charge if they were certified to have originated from a
 third party state.

NANJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 650 rural and
township enterprises in east China's Jiangsu Province are
empowered to deal in imports and exports on their own, the largest
number of any other province in China, according to official
statistics,
</P>
<P>
One of China's economic powerhouses, Jiangsu has attached great
importance to the development of rural and township enterprises
since China launched its market economy reform program in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the export value of Jiangsu's rural

the start of the 1990s, about a quarter of their total business
revenue during the period.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's rural and township enterprises have utilized a total
of more than eight billion U.S. dollars in actual overseas funds.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Pool Resources to Build New Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The lower reaches of Haihe River,
close to north China's Tianjin, will be opened to navigation with
plans for a multi-purpose economic zone to be established there.
</P>
<P>
To help execute the plan, the city of Tianjin has invited other
areas in north China including Beijing to pool resources. Vice
Mayor Wang Shuzu suggested that investments could be made to build
shipping berths and construct factories and warehouses, forming a
new industrial zone in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, cargo vessels with capacities ranging from 5,
000 dead weight tons (dwt) to 10,000 dwt, will be allowed to ply
39.5 km upstream from the estuary of the Haihe River.
</P>
<P>
An expert from Tianjin Port Affairs Administration said it
would be a low cost operation to construct berths along the lower
reaches of the Haihe River, where transport conditions are good.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from north and northwest China who attended an import
and export fair held in Tianjin earlier this month showed strong
interest in the plan.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is a traditional marine export port for north and
northwest China, from where 60 percent of the two regions' cargo
exports are shipped overseas.
</P>
<P>
Haihe harbor, part of the Tianjin Port, currently has 86 berths.
Last year, it handled 6.86 million tons of cargo, accounting for
one tenth of Tianjin Port's total handling volume.

<HEADLINE> IOC Scale Down Selection Process Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) have decided to scale down their plans to
change the way the Olympic Games' venues are chosen. But their
proposal was made only after confronting fierce internal
opposition.
</P>
<P>
IOC vice-president Dick Pound said on Monday that the entire
membership would still be allowed to decide the hosting city,
although they will vote on only two candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
Faced by the Salt Lake City corruption scandal, the IOC's
ruling executive board had proposed to let a smaller election
committee to slim the bidders' list. But the move caused an outcry
among many members who were unhappy to lose their most powerful
right. They held a special meeting to express their opposition.
</P>
<P>
Pound said the plan now was that the election committee would
reduce the number of bidding cities to two and the whole
membership would then vote to decide the venue.
</P>
<P>
This proposal is due to be put before a meeting of the entire
IOC membership in Lausanne on Wednesday and Thursday. The
proposal is believed to be easier to be approved than the original.
And the members of the selection committee would be chosen on the
day of the election.
</P>
<P>
Asked if this was enough to stop corruption in the future, the
Canadian lawyer replied: "I think it will strengthen it (the vote).
"
</P>
<P>
The IOC is due to vote later this year on the venue of the 2006
Winter Games. In a bid to stamp out corruption, members have been
banned from visiting the bidding cities for the first time and the
cities have been prevented from visiting IOC members.
</P>
<P>
The IOC membership will vote this week whether to expel six
members from the organization for their part in the Salt Lake
scandal, the biggest and most damaging one in the history of the
movement.
</P>
<P>
The IOC members named have been accused of breaking rules on
taking gifts from Salt Lake before the U.S. city won the bid in
1995 to host the 2002 Winter Games. Four other members have
already quit over the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a new investigation into Sydney's successful bid to
stage the 2000 Summer Games, senior IOC member Jacques Rogge said
the body had not policed its own guidelines on the value of gifts
and hospitality members were allowed to receive.
</P>
<P>
Independent investigator Tom Sheridan said that Sydney had
breached IOC rules with "red carpet treatment" but said there was
no evidence of the kind of bribery which had been part of Salt
Lake City's successful bid.
</P>
<P>
Rogge claimed that it was a "collective guilt" for the IOC not
to be tough enough in implementing its own rules.
</P>
<P>
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, under fire from critics
both inside and outside the movement urging him to quit, has
called for a vote of confidence in his leadership during the
special session. But his aides were confident he would survive to
stay on the post.

<HEADLINE> Successful Conclusion of NPC Session Hailed by HK Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers Tuesday
carried commentaries or editorials to hail the successful
conclusion of the annual session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) and described the session as "pragmatic" and "
inspiring."
</P>
<P>
Almost every newspaper, Chinese and English, devoted large
columns to reporting the just-concluded NPC session and the "
straight and sincere" talking from Premier Zhu Rongji about the
state of the economy and the hardships as well as the Taiwan
question and China-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao issued an editorial entitled "Advance With Unity
and Create New Merits" to warmly congratulate the two annual
sessions of the NPC and the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on their great
successes, which were closed in Beijing on March 15 and 11
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said the two sessions will encourage the people
throughout the country to get united and push forward the
socialist cause with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century
in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the government work report and the
atmosphere of the sessions fully show that the Chinese government
and people are full of confidence in the country's future despite
various difficulties ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
South China Morning Post said in a commentary that the massive
vote of confidence shown by the 98.4 percent support for Zhu's
government work report at the NPC "indicates that people believe
he is on the right track with his reforms."
</P>
<P>
"There is every sign they will continue to support him
providing he can maintain the pace which he set at the outset,
even though this year is likely to be more testing than the last,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also mentioned the NPC delegates' support for the
procuratorate report, saying the 78 percent vote reflected "a firm
signal that the anti-graft campaign is beginning to take effect."
</P>
<P>
An editorial by Wen Wei Po described the successful convocation
of the two sessions as a major event in China's political life,
adding that they have played a great role in law and decision
making.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the approval of the amendment to the
Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a milestone in
China's effort to practice the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
It is extremely necessary and timely to put Deng Xiaoping's
theory into the constitution, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
A commentary issued by Ming Pao Daily expressed the hope that
Premier Zhu who is widely well-received both at home and abroad
and that efforts will be made to further promote economic reform
on the one hand and political reform on the other so as to open up
new prospects for the country.
</P>
<P>

concluded NPC session was a democratic and practical meeting and a
meeting to encourage the Chinese people to get united and usher in

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find Oldest Fossilized Frog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese paleontologists today
said that the most primitive frog yet discovered could have lived
in China, enhancing the theory that amphibians might have
originated in Asia, a theory that until now had lacked solid
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuan and Gao Keqin, both with the Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) published their findings in the latest issue of
Chinese Science Bulletin, where they said that the intact frog
fossil recently discovered in northeastern China's Liaoning
Province was at least 120 million years old.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Wang said their new find,
a species called callobatrachus sanyanensis, must have been very
rare.
</P>
<P>
International paleontologists have regarded eodiscoglossus, a
primitive frog found in Spain in the 1950s, as the oldest frog.
Other fossil frogs have been discovered in North and South America.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with eodiscoglossus, callobatrachus sanyanensis
possesses more primitive features," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are focusing their study on the evolution of
amphibious animals which are believed to be the sole links between
aquatic animals and their terrestrial successors.
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited to have found this fossil in the mesozoic
deposits in Beipiao City," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Beipiao is also where various fossils of other prehistoric
creatures have been discovered, such as a dinosaur-like bird and
the primitive bony fish.
</P>
<P>
"The oldest frog lived on land with dinosaurs," Wang said, "So
this finding will push forward research into the frog's origin
here."

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
imported and exported 801 million U.S. dollars worth of goods in
the first two months this year, up 8.1 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The province approved 63 foreign-funded enterprises, actually
utilizing foreign investment of 117 million U.S. dollars, up 42
and 14.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Authorities attribute this achievement to greater effort in
expanding the overseas market, optimizing commodity structure, and
improving the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Hebei's export goods mainly went to the United States, Japan
and some European countries, with newly signed contractual
projects and labor service agreements reaching 140 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao, Langfang, and Shijiazhuang accounted for 63
percent of the overseas funds utilized by Hebei in the first two

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Join SADC Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will take part in
military exercises in South Africa code-named "Exercise Blue
Crane" later this year together with other members of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF) spokesman Brigadier
General Sylivester Ryoba, was quoted by Tuesday's Daily Mail as
saying that the exact dates of the exercises have not yet been
decided.
</P>
<P>
Ryoba said that Tanzania has sent some senior army officers to
Canada for military training for peace-keeping missions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The officers are expected to pass the knowledge to their
colleagues upon their return home from Canada," he said. Ryoba
said, however, the training was by no means connected with the
Organization of African Unity plans to establish a continental
rapid deployment force.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that OAU has plans to form a peace keeping force,"
he said, adding that he was not aware of any military unit formed
by OAU for the purpose of rapid deployment force as yet.
</P>
<P>
Ryoba said that Tanzania has already participated in
peace-keeping missions and military training related to the
concept of rapid deployment forces before.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Become More Aware of Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUBEI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A dispute over a seven cent
telephone call is not a trivial matter to Li Xiaolan, a woman in
central China's Hunan Province, who sued the local
telecommunications bureau after bringing in the consumer rights
association.
</P>
<P>
The story is simple. She made a call at a public phone booth
last year, but the line was busy. However, she was still charged 0.
6 yuan (seven cents) for the call.
</P>
<P>
"If it happened a few years ago, I would have just forgotten
the matter. But, since our rights have legal protection and there
is a place to handle such cases, we should do our part to
safeguard our lawful right," she said.
</P>
<P>
Due to an increasing public awareness, some 10,000 associations
at various levels are becoming busier. Last year, they handled 660,
000 cases, 96.7 percent of which were satisfactorily settled,
recovering losses worth 500 million yuan for consumers.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined the International Consumers' Association in
1987, government departments have held various activities on
Consumer's Day of March 15 every year to help publicity and make
available information about consumer laws and regulations as well
as details about specific cases.
</P>
<P>
In the future, China intends to carry out even more publicity
work over these issues in rural areas. An initial effort in this
regard has paid off with a three percent increase in the number of
last year's cases involving consumer right violations of
agriculture-related products.

</P>
<P>
Shandong had a total of 2.88 million individually-run
industrial and commercial businesses and 98,000 private firms by
the end of last year, employing a combined 7.83 million people,
about 12.4 percent of the entire provincial workforce, according
to the Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>

Last year alone, 200,000 workers displaced by state-owned
enterprises were employed by individually-run and private
businesses, which reported a total of 211.5 billion yuan in sales
and 64 billion yuan in added value the same year, up 44 percent
and 43.8 percent, respectively, from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Fish Banned in Uganda's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The city council of Kampala,
Uganda's capital city, has banned the selling of fish in all
markets in the city for one month following reports of increasing
fish poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached Monday, the Monitor daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, several people including one child
have died after eating poisoned fish.
</P>
<P>
William Tumwine, assistant town clerk of central division, was
quoted as saying that on March 13, two tons of poisoned fish were
impounded at Nakasero market frequented by foreigners and were
destroyed later.
</P>
<P>
Some officials of the Department of Gender, Welfare and
Community Services Committee said that despite the vigorous
inspection of fish landing sites, the wrongdoers were constantly
changing tactics.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis is needed to check on rampant fish poisoning and
the council should release a statement to enlighten the masses on
the dangers of poisoned fish, the committee resolved.
</P>
<P>
Fish poisoning has been reported to be on the rise recently.
This, Ugandan officials fear, may invite another ban on fish
imports by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU banned fish products from Uganda in early 1997 after
finding cholera erupted in the country. It later suspended the ban
following a report which said that the quality of Uganda's fish
products had been improved a lot.

<HEADLINE> SDB Opens 20 Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese State Development
Bank (SDB) announced today that 20 regional branches of the former
China Investment Bank (CIB) have been converted into SDB branches
effective today.
</P>
<P>
The branches are in big cities including Tianjin, Shenyang,
Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The CIB was merged into the SDB in December last year.
</P>
<P>
President of the SDB Chen Yuan said that the opening of the 20
branches, plus its previously established Wuhan branch, will
enable the SDB to manage most of its loans instead of entrusting
them to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the long-term business relationship
between the SDB and the commercial banks will not change.
</P>
<P>
The SDB is China's largest policy-oriented bank, with total
assets exceeding 500 billion yuan. Since it was founded five years
ago, it has provided strong support to the country's
infrastructure construction and basic and pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the 20 branches sets a solid foundation for the
SDB to develop into a full-service bank," Chen said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi (India)-Lahore
(Pakistan) regular bus service began here Tuesday morning when the
first bus carrying 34 people including two security men, a liaison
officer and two drivers left here.
</P>
<P>
The service was flagged off by Delhi Transport Minister Parvez
Hashmi amid tight security. The specially-made Delhi Transport
Corporation bus will cover the 538-kilometer distance to Lahore in
about 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
The 29 people constituted the first group of passengers to
travel to Pakistan by the maiden regular run of the Delhi-Lahore
bus. They were seen excited as they waved to their relatives who
came to see them off.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi-Lahore bus service is regarded as a good step to
enhance exchanges between the two peoples and countries.
</P>
<P>
The move was initiated by the prime ministers of the two
countries, Atal Behari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif, when they met in
New York in September last year and Vajpayee crossed the
Indo-Pakistan border by bus on February 20 this year, the first
time by an Indian prime minister in the past five decades or more.
</P>
<P>
The four-day-a-week bus service -- twice from the Indian side
and twice from the Pakistan side -- got off following trial runs
from both sides in February.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a notice here Tuesday, advising
against all non-essential travel to Turkey at this time.
</P>
<P>
The notice said that in view of the recent bombing incidents in
Istanbul, New Zealand travelers are advised to consider deferring
all non-essential travel to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders in Turkey should keep themselves informed of
developments that might affect their safety and they should
maintain a high level of security awareness, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
While releasing the notice, ministry spokesman James Funnell
said the ministry had thought carefully before warning New
Zealanders not to travel to Turkey, but recent violence had been
linked fairly directly to the arrest last month of Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan. The violence is likely to continue, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Research Urged for NZ Meat, Wool Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Innovative use of
biotechnology
coupled with cooperative research between major players of meat
and
wool industries in New Zealand are keys to building more
profitable
meat and wool industries, NZ Wool Board Chairman Bruce Munro said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a media release issued by the NZ Wool Board here
Tuesday, Munro said he could foresee a day when the meat and wool
section would be replaced by biotechnology and genetics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Federated Farmers' Meat and Wool Section
conference in Hamilton, a city on North Island, Munro said: "The
genetic and biological assets sleeping within New Zealand
agriculture
are a resource of potentially enormous value. New Zealand needs to

organize itself to take advantage of these assets."
</P>
<P>
"Biotechnology is in many respects an infant science, but there
is
no doubt in my mind that our natural genetic advantages and our
ability to harness the renewable and ongoing resource of grass and

sunshine will combine to create a world few of us are yet dreaming

about."
</P>
<P>
He said that to fully capitalize on New Zealand's natural
advantages would require two things -- a strategic research
partner
and the combined resources of the meat and wool industries.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way we can create the necessary platform to
exploit our genetic advantages and the opportunities biotechnology

presents us with," Munro said.

<HEADLINE> ADB in Talks for Economic Loans to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) is negotiating loans worth a record 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
for India in 1999, a government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An eight-member ADB team has already arrived here and started
discussions with the Indian government on Monday to finalize the
projects that will receive loans from the bank.
</P>
<P>
Last year, several loan programs were shelved due to opposition
from Japan following India's nuclear tests in May last year. So
far Japan has not yet revoked its economic sanctions against
India. It is not yet clear whether the Japanese will follow the
U.S. example and abstain from voting when the loans come up for
discussion by the ADB board.
</P>
<P>
"At the World Bank level, it seems to be a case-by-case
approach. We will wait and see what is the reaction at the ADB
level. So far we have not heard anything from the Japanese," the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Polish Agriculture Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Polish Agriculture and Food
Economy Minister Jacek Janiszewski resigned Monday after his
Polish Peasant Party withdrew confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek accepted Janiszewski's resignation
letter in which he said he decided to resign in the interests of
the party led by him. But Janiszewski did not elaborate, and his
replacement is yet to be named.
</P>
<P>
Janiszewski was reportedly rapped by the agrarian party's
political committee for his attendance at a meeting of the ruling
Solidarity Election Action (AWS) last week which the party's
leadership had decided to boycott.
</P>
<P>
The AWS, the country's largest alliance of conservative
political parties including the peasant party, forms the ruling
coalition with the Liberal Union for Freedom (UW).
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said Janiszewski's departure was related to
an economic scandal during which he allegedly abused his power
when he was chief of an agriculture enterprise. The Supreme Court
reportedly verified the scandal. And as a result, the UW and the
opposition had strongly demanded the removal of Janiszewski from
his post.
</P>
<P>
Janiszewski is the ninth to leave the Buzek cabinet since the
last government reshuffle. Buzek sacked four ministers and four
deputy ministers, including the head of his office, in the revamp
early this month.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Grants Stopgap Money in Farm Loan </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton has
agreed to a stopgap measure that makes more than 450 million
dollars in farm loans available for financially strapped farmers.
</P>
<P>
In signing the measure into law Monday, Clinton said that it

The law covers funds that had been limited to the Beginning
Farmers and Ranchers program until April 1. Since then, the
Clinton Administration could make it available to anyone eligible

</P>
<P>
The money is intended to bridge the gap for farmers until
Congress has a chance to act on Clinton's request for 153 million
dollars in extra money this year for emergency loans and to hire
temporary government workers to handle the heavy disaster
assistance demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the Agriculture Department, the past year of low
prices has sent farmers racing for loans, nearly depleting its
funds.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on the Congress to work expeditiously to include
these amounts in a supplemental bill that does not include unwise
and unnecessary offsets.

<HEADLINE> Amphetamines Top List of Drugs Used by Thai Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Amphetamines ranked top among
drugs used by students in Thailand during January 1997 to August
1998, survey results available Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted recently by the Education Ministry,
showed that amphetamine is most widely used in schools, followed
by solvents, heroin, marijuana and hallucinogens.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,681 students nationwide used amphetamines while
1,596 others were addicted to solvents, 517 to heroin, 513 to
marijuana, 127 to hallucinogens and 312 to several other kinds of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 36,865 students were addicted to nicotine and
13,514 to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the ministry's committee in charge of directing
drug-free campaigns for schools had proposed that the education
minister order educational institutes at every level to run the
campaign and focus on amphetamine suppression.
</P>
<P>
People are urged to inform the ministry about any illegal drug
usage in schools by dialing the number 1579, a line which is open
24 hours.

<HEADLINE> UEFA raises 75 Percent of Target Prize Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- UEFA's Task Force 2000, set up
last October to counter the launch of a proposed breakaway
European Super League, claimed on Monday it has raised 75 percent
of its target prize money for a revamped Champions League.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force, formed to combat the Super League's promise of
attractive payouts to lure Europe's top clubs away from UEFA, said
its television negotiations with member countries were nearly
complete.
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely on target to reach the goal of 800 million
francs (570 million U.S. dollars)," said Juergen Lenz, one of two
managing directors of UEFA's marketing company TEAM. "We
basically have a small gap to cover and we still have some
countries to negotiate with. So it's looking very good."
</P>
<P>
Lenz said that deals had been reached with five of the top six
biggest money-generating countries, which contribute 85 percent of
UEFA's television rights income. While negotiations with Spain,
Italy, England, Italy and the Netherlands are finished, nothing
has yet been settled with Germany.
</P>
<P>
UEFA was at 75 percent in reaching the television goal,
according to UEFA's General Secretary Gerhard Aigner. "It's what
we expected. We have 12 contracts and we are confident we will
reach our final target. And whatever goes beyond the target is a
gratifying result," he said.
</P>
<P>
With representatives from Europe's top clubs as members, the
task force discussed if clubs should have 25 or more players,
whether they should be allowed to have the goal keeper in addition
if required, and the deadlines before which they have to submit
their players list. They also debated whether yellow cards should
be accumulated to two or three before earning a suspension.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are in response to a Super League conceived by
Milan-based marketing firm Media Partners, which last year
attempted to lure some of the biggest names in European soccer
into its new competition with a reported 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
in prize money. The organization has targeted on such influential
clubs as Manchester United, Inter and AC Milan, Bayern Munich and
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
UEFA countered by both raising prize money offer and giving
clubs more say in how the money should be distributed.

<HEADLINE> Official Car Policy May Benefit Buick Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A possible change in government
official car policies in China may benefit foreign car-makers,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sources quoting a recent report said the central government
raised the former maximum engine size of "official cars" from 2.5
liters to 3 liters and lowered price restrictions, according to
the Daily.
</P>
<P>
This can benefit the sales of Buicks built by Shanghai-General
Motors (GM), since the displacement of the Buick models are 2.98
liters with prices ranging from 340,000 yuan (40,963 US dollars)
to 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to GM's plan, the Shanghai joint venture will produce
50,000 Buicks in the year 2000, and 100,000 units a year
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
One of the GM's competitors in China, the Guangzhou Honda
Automobile Co. Ltd, is also striving for a share of government
purchases. Last month, the Guangzhou-based joint venture provided
30 Accord sedans to the Beijing Shouqi Group that runs China's
official fleets for State guests.
</P>
<P>
With a 2.3-liter engine and a retail price of 298,000 yuan, the
Accord is viewed as competitive model in the mid-size car market.
</P>
<P>
But FAW-Volkswagen, the producer of the Audi line in China,
does not view the new regulation as a formidable challenge.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 6,000 sales of 2.4-liter Audi or Audi 1.8-liter TDI
models doubled the figure of 1997.

<HEADLINE> CAF President Calls for African World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAKAR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Africa, whose soccer has taken a
giant step forward in the last decade but yet to bring the game's
most prestigious tournament to the continent, fully deserves a
World Cup finals in the year of 2006, the continent's top soccer
official claimed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are completely qualified to host the World Cup
finals. The first and foremost reason is that Africa is the only
continent on the planet which has never staged the event," Issa
Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF)
said in his interview with "African Soccer" magazine on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the history of the World Cup, Europe has hosted nine finals,
South America four, and North and Central Americas three. Asia
will play host in 2002 but Africa has never staged soccer's
premier event.
</P>
<P>
Another reason cited by Hayatou is that Africa has grown into a
major force in the game during the past ten years, which has been
recognized by FIFA. The sport's world governing body has granted
five berths to Africa for the 2002 World Cup, compared to four to
Asia, three to CONCACA, four and a half to South America.
</P>
<P>
Though considerable African countries have the capability to
stage World Cup finals, it will be wise to have just one African
representative to avoid "distracting efforts", Hayatou said.
</P>
<P>
He calls for negotiation among the several African bidders and
suggests a possible appointment of an official bidder by CAF if
negotiation fails.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is believed to be leading the African race which
also included Egypt, Ghana, Morocco and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
European bidders England and Germany are also presenting so
strong a case that it's widely considered the bidding campaign is
a three-horse race involving the two previous hosts and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will decide in March 2000 the venue for the 2006 World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Conduct Remote Experiment Via Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Beijing have
conducted a high level experiment in a nuclear analysis lab in
east China's Shanghai, nearly 1,500 kilometers away, via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Science Times, the first example of
such experiments in China underlines the trend for making
increasing use of computer and Internet technology to help
scientists share advanced experimental instruments, even if at a
distance.
</P>
<P>
"If a nationwide network, sharing the resources of advanced and
expensive instruments, can be established in China, the
duplication of funds and equipment can be avoided and research
efficiency greatly increased," a scientist with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Internet technology will provide a first level research
environment for scientists and make it possible to conduct joint
experiments participated in by a large number of scientists and
labs in different countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear scientists are especially interested in the tele-
experiment, said one taking part, because most nuclear science
experiments in laboratories require the cooperation of many
scientists. He noted that "it will save time and money on
traveling."
</P>
<P>
However, some experts claims that existing Internet technology
can not completely meet the demand for such remote experiments and
that further development is still needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Motorola announced Monday that
it has donated 5 million U.S. dollars to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) to create the Motorola digitalDNA
Laboratory, which will focus on developing smart technology.
</P>
<P>
Smart technology will allow machines to communicate with not
only humans but also other devices so as to keep a household
running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Associated Press said the Laboratory is
expected to be completed in 2003. At the new laboratory,
scientists will work on a new generation of smart product
applications, such as clothing with computerized labels that can
tell a washing machine which cycle to use, and a dishwasher that
can communicate with other household appliances about noise levels
and energy usage.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, one of the world's largest electronics companies, has
been cooperating with MIT for five years. Smart products may be
ready for the mass market within the next decade, a senior
official with the company said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economy Improves Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in four months,
Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) on Tuesday revised slightly
upward its assessment of the country's economy, though retaining a
view that the overall economic situation remains severe.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in the process of slowing its downward momentum,
" the agency said in its latest monthly economic report.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said it made the revision in the March report mainly
because of the favorable effects of various policy measures, such
as earlier-than-planned implementation of public works projects.
</P>
<P>
The agency, in each of its previous three monthly reports, said
it had detected "embryonic movements" toward a recovery of the
sluggish Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The EPA's March report recognized slight improvements in such
areas as consumer spending, public spending, private production
and financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending has stopped falling although the level is
still low because income has been deteriorating, it said.
</P>
<P>
Public spending is very firm due to the earlier-than-planned
implementation of the first extra budget for fiscal 1998, which
ends March 31.
</P>
<P>
Production has also stopped falling and inventory has declined
to lower levels than a year earlier, the report said, adding that
the expansion of government credit guarantees for small and mid-
size companies has helped reduce the number of corporate
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the Bank of Japan's easy monetary policy,
together with a series of government financial measures, has
helped stabilize the financial markets and long-term and short-
term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, noted that corporate spending and
employment remained in a very severe situation.
</P>
<P>
Corporate capital spending continued to show sharp declines and
the jobless rate still moved at an unprecedentedly high level, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Population on Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania's population continued
to decrease in 1998, falling by 0.16 percent from the previous
year to 22.29 million, official figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 birth rate remained 0.15 percent, the same with the
1997 level, and the child mortality rate decreased slightly 1.5
percentage points from 2.05 percent from 1997, according to the
figures released by Romania's Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
Some Romanian medical experts attributed the decreasing trend
to higher mortality rate resulting from falling living standards
and to the consistent emigration of Romanians.
</P>
<P>
They said more Romanians died of diseases such as tuberculosis
and cancer due to deteriorating medical care.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 population figure was 3.1 percent less than the record
high of 23.2 million registered in 1990 after eight consecutive
years of decreasing.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said here Monday that as long as the European Union (EU)
countries are willing to compromise, they can reach an agreement
on Agenda 2000 at the Berlin Summit in late March.
</P>
<P>
Germany is prepared to compromise in this regard, Schroeder
told a press conference after meeting Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor began a tour of EU capitals Monday to try
to whip up support for Agenda 2000, the European Union's spending
reform plan for the years 2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, whose country currently holds the rotating EU
presidency, expressed regret over the Thursday meeting, where EU
agricultural ministers failed to reach a consensus on the amount
of the farm subsidy.
</P>
<P>
He said EU countries should seek to reduce the subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the resignation of his Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine last week, he said the resignation does not mean a
change in Germany's EU policies and will not influence the
preparation of the EU summit.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Infection Continues to Spread in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS infection is continuing to
spread in Vietnam with new groups affected by the disease, the
English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reported cases of HIV/AIDS infection have increased
significantly among several groups previously considered to be at
low risk of contracting the disease, such as conscripted youth and
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS sufferers can now be found in nearly all Vietnam's
communities and professions and in every province.
</P>
<P>
AIDS victims can be found in many clinics and hospitals in Ho
Chi Minh City, a sign that the disease has spread to a very
dangerous extent. This will negatively impact the health care
sector and the socioeconomic development in the coming years, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National AIDS Committee reports that as of early this
year, an estimated 12,306 people had been infected with the HIV
virus and 2,374 AIDS victims had been identified. About 1,249
people have already died of the disease and in some families all
members are HIV carriers or have already died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's northern province of Quang Ninh has the country's
highest rate of HIV transmission. In the past two years, 1,451 HIV
sufferers have been found there, with 800 of whom from Cam Pha
Township.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is also spreading in Vietnam's remote areas and experts
are particularly worried about the vulnerability of ethnic
minority groups inhabiting the border provinces.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Vietnam has an estimated 500 new-born children
infected with the HIV virus. By the end of last year, HIV
sufferers under 19 years old had made up 7.1 percent of the
recorded total.
</P>
<P>
Reports of HIV cases in Vietnam's detention camps are also
increasing rapidly. A majority of those being re-educated in the
Hai Phong and Quang Ninh camps have contracted the HIV virus.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mars Global Surveyor, sent
to space by NASA, has sent back snapshots of the "Happy Face
Crater" on Mars, said the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Happy Face Crater, with 220-kilometer-side, is
really the Galle Crater on the eastern side of a basin called
Argyre Planitia.
</P>
<P>
The Happy Face was first noticed in images sent back to Earth
during the Viking 1 mission to Mars in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Mars Global Surveyor, managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, was launched in 1996 and reached the planet in 1997.
It began its main science mission this week after a long delay in
achieving the proper orbit for mapping.

<HEADLINE> More Jakarta Children Suffer Malnutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 3,000 cases of
malnutrition have been detected among children under five years
old in the Indonesian capital during the current economic crisis,
which first hit the country in 1997, The Jakarta Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The head of community health development of the city health
agency M. Husni Thamrin said that at least 58 of the malnourished
children were presently in the hospital due to complications
resulting from lack of food.
</P>
<P>
"I think the number of malnutrition cases will continue to
increase if the (economic) condition doesn't show any signs of
abating as a drop in people's purchasing power will prevent an
increasing number of families from buying proper nutrition for
their children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thamrin also said the actual figure of malnourished children
could be much higher because the figure was obtained last
December.
</P>
<P>
There are about 500,000 to 600,000 children under five years
old in the city, Thamrin was quoted by the paper as saying.

QUITO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian taxi drivers staged a
national strike on Monday to protest the price increase of fuel.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Quito, protesters used their cars to
block main avenues early in the morning, while witnesses say some
intersections were obstructed by burning rubber tires that gave
off intense black clouds of smoke.
</P>
<P>
There were no taxi services throughout the country, according
to Pedro Alava, president of the National Federation of Taxi
Drivers, which launched the strike.
</P>
<P>
Local media confirmed the extent of the strike claiming that
taxi drivers in the country's largest city of Guayaquil were also
planning to continue the strike indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
In Azuay province, 6,000 transport workers, members of the
Syndicate of Drivers, walked off their jobs at dawn.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad last Thursday announced a
package of harsh austerity measures. He ordered the banks
temporarily closed to prevent massive withdrawals, froze many U.S.
dollar checking accounts for one year, doubled the price of
gasoline, and proposed impprisonment for tax evaders.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said last year the country saw its "worst economic
crisis in 70 years." The crisis was complicated by floods, which
effected the production of bananas, an a slump in oil prices that
hurt its oil exports, the country's main hard currency earner.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks More Foreign Funds to Develop Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to absorb huge
amount of foreign funds to speed up the development of new coal
mines and the modernization of existing mines.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Baoming, head of the State Administration of
Coal Industry, China will utilize more direct foreign investment
for new mine development and construction, particularly for large-
scale surface mines.
</P>
<P>
The senior official noted that the country will observe the
principle of "who invests, who benefits" and work out a series of
more preferential policies for the purpose of inviting foreign
mining companies, trading firms and financial institutions to
operate coal mines either in the form of joint ventures or
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China will take advantage of foreign funds to
modernize the existing mines by means of converting the existing
state-owned assets of some selected coal enterprises into shares
to upgrade the coal mines for better economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Direct investment from overseas will also be utilized for
building coal slurry pipelines, tapping coalbed methane, building
pit-head power plants and developing clean coal technology, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that in the coming years, China will devote
major efforts to the pre-construction preparations for more than a
dozen large-and medium-scale pit-head power plants in the Junggar
Basin and other mining areas by using foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
China will at the same time strive hard to exploit coalbed
methane as secondary coal resources and cooperate with foreign
firms for exploring and appraising coalbed methane resources. The
country aims to establish a group of coalbed methane tapping
centers in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country will try to develop a great number of
comprehensive coal utilization projects by utilizing foreign funds,
including coking plants, cement works, and mining machinery and
refractory material factories.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Vavuniya District in
the north of the country has been liberated from the Tamil rebels
and life there has returned to normal, the official Daily News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said all four divisions of Vavuniya and most
of the northern Wanni area have been liberated after government
troops eliminated or drove away the rebels there in Operation Rana
Gosa (the Sound of the War).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Sri Lankan government troops launched the
operation to expand the security force-controlled territory in the
northern area.
</P>
<P>
The report said parliamentarians of mainstream Tamil political
parties, who were unable to visit the area earlier, Monday toured
the liberated sections.
</P>
<P>
A Tamil party spokesman said it was heartening to see civilians
enjoying their newly-won freedom and being provided with food and
other essentials of which they had been deprived under the rebels'
rule, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that public transport has also been restored in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels have been waging a war against the government
since 1983 for a separate state of its own in the north and east
of the country.

SOFIA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has been admitted into the
Geneva-based European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) as
its 20th member, Deputy Prime Minister Vesselin Metodiev said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Metodiev, also minister of education and science, said
membership in the organization provides chances for Bulgarian
businesses to cooperate with it.
</P>
<P>
He said that the non-ferrous metals plant in Sofia had signed a
five-million-dollar contract with CERN this year for the
production of a detector for a nuclear accelerator being developed
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The accelerator, a project involving scientists from over 100
institutes in 40 countries, will be used in the study of the
universe, Metodiev said. It is expected to provide information on
the Big Bang explosion and the earliest stage of the evolution of
the universe.
</P>
<P>
The CERN was established in 1953 as an intergovernmental
organization for fundamental research in high-tech physics and
nuclear physics. It now has as its members all European Union
member countries, Switzerland, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, the latter four admitted in 1991 and 1992.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready to Cooperate With Cambodia: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
said his country is ready any time to cooperate with Cambodia as
was proven in the recent past when Indonesia helped the latter in
restoring its political stability.
</P>
<P>
"As for increasing cooperation, Indonesia is ready to step up
its assistance in the form of human resources development programs
and technical assistance in various fields," Habibie said in a
speech at a state dinner in honor of the visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The president reaffirmed that Indonesia would continue to give
full support to Cambodia and hoped that all the efforts the
Cambodian nation makes toward national rehabilitation and
reconstruction would succeed.
</P>
<P>
"In the economic sector, our bilateral relations have been
showing encouraging progress, especially in the fields of trade
and investment," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the two countries could further
step up their bilateral relations parallel to improvements in the
region's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, we have also noticed concrete development in our
bilateral cooperation in the social, cultural as well as military
fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
On regional cooperation, Habibie hailed Cambodia's entry into
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the Sixth
ASEAN Summit in Hanoi last year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Cambodia will officially join the ASEAN
next month.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia sees the presence of Cambodia in ASEAN as the
fulfillment of the aspirations and ideals of the association's
founders to form the ASEAN-10 in facing the increasing challenges
and competition at regional as well as global level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's membership in ASEAN was also expected to strengthen
ASEAN's efforts in promoting regional peace, stability and
prosperity, the president was quoted by Antara News Agency Tuesday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen and his eight-member entourage arrived in Jakarta on
Monday for a three-day official visit to strengthen ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Hun Sen has visited Indonesia. His
first visit came in 1994 when he was Cambodia's second prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Habibie and Hun Sen will hold bilateral talks on Tuesday at
Merdeka Palace here.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Seeks Sweden's Support for Agenda 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder stressed here Monday that a final deal of a EU
reform package dubbed Agenda 2000 must be hammered out when heads
of state and government of the 15-member bloc meet in Berlin next
week.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who was on a working visit aiming to seek Sweden's
support for Agenda 2000, made the remarks after meeting with his
Swedish counterpart, Goran Persson. He said Agenda 2000 was a
major topic of his discussions with Persson.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and we must reach a package agreement upon Agenda 2000
at the Berlin summit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agenda 2000 is a package designed to reform the EU budget, farm
subsidy spending and aid for poorer regions of the bloc. A 2000-
2006 long-term budget accord and a reform of EU's Common
Agricultural Policy are the two key issues covered by the Agenda.
But the 15 EU member states remained divided over the two issues,
especially over the budget issue.
</P>
<P>
Some richer member states like Sweden, Austria and the
Netherlands demanded to reduce their annual net payments into the
EU coffers, but their demand was strongly rejected by members from
southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he agreed that richer countries should help
those poorer ones but such a help should not be a one-way exercise.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Schroeder, Persson said he hoped Sweden's
annual net contribution to the EU would not be increased too fast.
However, before Schroeder's visit, the Stockholm government was
strongly demanding a cut of its contribution.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Monitor Kosovo Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister
Andrei Gabriel Plesu said Monday that his country is now closely
following the reaction of the Yugoslav government after Kosovo
Albanians expressed their willingness to sign a peace agreement in
the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
Plesu made the remarks as the Serbian delegation and
representatives of the secessionist Kosovo Albanians began the
second round of peace talks in Paris. Kosovo is a mainly Albanian-
populated province in Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The first round of peace talks were adjourned on February 23 at
Rambouillet in the suburbs of Paris after the ethnic Albanian
delegation refused to sign the U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Plesu said that most Balkan countries, including Yugoslavia,
welcomed Greece's proposal for holding a regional meeting in
Bucharest in order to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
But Albania rejected the proposal on the grounds that
conditions are not yet ripe for such a meeting, Plesu said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was presented by Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou during his five-nation Balkan trip last week.
</P>
<P>
If the regional meeting could not open as proposed, Plesu said,
as the presidency state of the Southeast European Cooperation
Initiative (SECI), Romania is planning to issue a joint statement
on the Kosovo issue together with other SECI member states.
</P>
<P>
The SECI groups Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Yugoslavia,
Greece, Turkey and Romania.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Referee Defends Holyfield-Lewis Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Eugenia Williams, the U.S.
referee who judged Evander Holyfield as the winner in the
heavyweight showdown in New York Saturday, claimed she wasn't
biased and had no apologies.
</P>
<P>
The woman judge answered telephones at a cramped office in the
city hall, where she works as a $39,200-a-year accounts clerk,
saying: "People are entitled to their own opinion. I called what
I saw. I have no problems with that."
</P>
<P>
Williams, one of three judges for the undisputed title fight,
said she still thinks Holyfield won. But critics say she cheated
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Announcer Jim Lampley, who called the fight on pay per view,
called the decision "fraudulent." Lewis trainer Emmanuel Steward
used the word "fix". Lewis said he was "robbed".
</P>
<P>
New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer called for an
investigation, with his spokesman blaming either "incompetence" or
"tampering" for the decision. New York Gov. George Pataki asked
the state Athletic Commission to investigate.
</P>
<P>
"She is either biased, incompetent or worse," said HBO
matchmaker Lou DiBella.
</P>
<P>
Williams used to be a woman boxer and was growing up in
Atlantic City. She raised two children as a single mother and has
a day job in the city's landlord-tenant relations office.
</P>
<P>
She began judging amateur fights in 1983, then moved up to the
pro ranks in 1989. She has judged more than 90 fights, including
27 world title bouts.
</P>
<P>
Bob Lee, president and commissioner of the IBF called Williams
a top-class judge.
</P>
<P>
"She has impeccable credentials. I don't question her decision.
She is a good professional. If she says that's what she saw, then
I support her," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Williams scored the fight 115-113. WBA judge Stanley
Christodoulou of South Africa had it 116-113 for Lewis and WBC
judge Larry O'Connell of Britain scored it 115-115.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Prepares to Conduct National Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is gearing up for the April
1 launch of its national population and housing census, the
English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third census to investigate the nation's
population and the first to take housing issues into account. The
first population census in Vietnam was conducted in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will be carried out at 160,000 locations
across the country, including more than 1,000 rural communes.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, most cities and provinces have basically
finished preparing for the census. Almost 300,000 people,
including 2,500 key staff members and officials, have been
mobilized and stand ready at the provincial and district levels.
</P>
<P>
Nine statistics centers equipped with 252 computers will
analyze the data before and after the census. Two of the centers
are located in Hanoi and the rest are situated in urban centers
including Ho Chi Minh City, Nam Dinh, Da Nang, Khanh Hoa, Binh
Thuan, Can Tho and An Giang.
</P>
<P>
"The census aims to enumerate the national population and
generate a range of demographic data, including that on population
structure, gender, religion, education, employment, birth and
mortality rates, population development, housing and living
standards," Vietnam News quoted Le Van Toan, director of the
General Department of Statistics and deputy director of Vietnam's
National Census Steering Committee, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The results of the census will make a vital contribution to the
formulation of socioeconomic development policies in the next
century, the daily added.

</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which began Monday, is sponsored by the

Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Thailand have closely collaborated in many areas in
the health sector, Ket Sein said at the opening ceremony, citing
the latest visit to Myanmar by a Thai ear surgical mobile unit
which gave treatment and restored hearing to many patients in the
country's Taunggyi, Meiktila and Pakokku townships.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Seeks Extra Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- As it enters the second
construction stage, China's mammoth Three Gorges hydropower
project has required a more vigorous funding backup, which is
estimated will involve a total of 80 billion yuan through the 1998-
2003 period.
</P>
<P>
The amount is almost double the cost of the first construction
period (1993-1997) and there have been certain difficulties in
financing, according to China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corp.(CTGPC), proprietor of the project.
</P>
<P>
The company has so far verified some 55 billion yuan of funding
support for the second-phase construction, leaving a shortfall of
25 billion yuan yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease the financial burden, CTGPC has turned to a
number of domestic commercial banks looking for loan packages
worth 11 billion yuan. It also expects to amass another 11 billion
yuan on the domestic market, which includes 6 billion yuan from
corporate bond issuance and 5 billion yuan from the stock market.
</P>
<P>
In January, the company issued 2 billion yuan worth of bonds,
the second issuance after the initial bond of one billion yuan in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 3 billion yuan in foreign currency will be
raised from export earnings in buyers' credits and loans issued by
foreign bank branches in China to pay capital and interest of
foreign bank loans signed for the first construction period.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest water-control project has three solid
financing sources, besides the government spending, which is
budgeted at 11.3 billion yuan this year. They consist of profits
from the operational Gezhouba Power Plant and levies from
increased national hydroelectric prices as well as support from
the State Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Capital from the first two channels is expected to amount to
110 billion yuan, accounting for over 50 percent of the total
government funding and has no interest charges. The state bank has
promised 130 billion yuan of loans launched during the period of
1994 to 2003, or 65 percent of the total cost for the project.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the company said that when it becomes partly
operational in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam will be capable of
generating more than 67 billion yuan of revenue within five years.
It means that before the end of 2005, its own income will be
sufficient not only to meet the investment demand for the final-
stage construction, but also to pay off some of its debt.
</P>
<P>
Estimated to cost a total investment of 203.9 billion yuan, the
project on China's longest river the Yangtze, has secured capital
of 39 billion yuan for the first six years of construction. When
it is fully completed in 2010, it will have a total installed
generating capacity of 20.9 million kilowatt and a projected
yearly production of more than 100 billion kwh of electricity.

<HEADLINE> Norway to Cut Daily Oil Output by 100,000 Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Oil and Energy
Minister Marit Arnstad said here Monday that his country was ready
to further cut its oil output by 100,000 barrels a day in a bid to
maintain the stability of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Arnstad said after briefing the parliament on the cut plan,
that the legislature was supportive of the move.
</P>
<P>
He said Norway will start to implement the reduction plan on
April 1 after the parliament formally endorses it.
</P>
<P>
The minister added, however, that the precondition for the
Norwegian cut is that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) curtail their production in accordance
with their agreement.
</P>
<P>
To support OPEC's efforts to prop up oil prices by production
cuts, Norway has cut its daily oil output from the North Sea oil
fields by 100,000 barrels since last spring.
</P>
<P>
Norway's offshore oil companies have voluntarily reduced oil
production under the pressure of falling prices, leading to a
larger cut than the government had planned.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed the companies had actually cut the daily
output by 310,000 barrels from 3.4 million barrels to 2.99 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Norway, the largest oil producers in west Europe and the second
largest oil exporter in the world, yields about 200 million tons
of oil and natural gas in oil equivalent annually.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police, Army Hike Alert Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Police
(PNP) Monday ordered all its units nationwide to increase their
vigilance and intelligence monitoring to help detect and stop the
rebel New People's Army (NPA) attacks, the Journal newspaper said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the PNP as saying police and military stations
located in the vicinity of NPA guerrilla fronts are "highly
probable targets of large-scale tactical offensives."
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces of the Philippines ordered similar actions in
the countryside with a warning to military ground commanders that
they would be relieved should they fail to repel rebel offensives
in their areas, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The measures were taken half a month before the rebel group's
30th founding anniversary on March 29, it said.
</P>
<P>
The PNP earlier said the NPA "will go for liquidation and
disarming of police and military elements" in the countryside due
to the suspension of peace talks between the government and the
rebels, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Police intelligence officials said the NPA is expected to
launch offensives in advanced guerrilla fronts in Mindanao,
Visayas and Luzon this year.

percent growth and the private sector's sales were up nearly 14
percent.

<HEADLINE> Jardel Replaces Injured Elber for Asian Tour Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Potor striker Mario Jardel
was recalled on Monday to the Brazilian national side to replace
injured Elber for a scheduled Asian tour later this month.
</P>
<P>
Jardel, the Portuguese League's leading scorer with 27 goals,
came to Brazilian coach Vanderly Luxemburgo's rescue after Bayern
Munich striker tore ligaments in his left knee in Saturday's
Bundesliga match against Hamburg SV.
</P>
<P>
Elber flew to the United States on Monday to undergo surgery
and will be out of action for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo was the notable absentee from the list for the
Brazilian side's Asian tour which will bring the World Cup runners-
up to take on South Korea on March 28 and Japan three days later.
The Inter Milan marksman, whose season has been plagued by injury
and who has not played for his country since last year's World Cup
final against France, dropped out at his own request.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgo, under whom Brazil has posted a 2-1 record for their
three international friendlies, also decided against Real Madrid's
free kick expert Roberto Carlos and the game's most expensive
player Denilson of Real Betis.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona midfielder Rivaldo was among the nine foreign-based
players named by Luxemburgo, who is also to try six uncapped
players in his building a side to defend the Copa America title in
Paraguay in July.

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A national campaign aimed at
improving the quality of highway construction is in full swing,
according to China's Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has designated this year as the "Year of Quality
Highway Construction" and drawn up a series of measures to enhance
the quality control of highway construction.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans to carry out two nationwide quality
check-ups, which will cover the construction of all national
highways and major trunk roads.
</P>
<P>
It has also decided to increase the investment by one percent
for regions which have completed first-rate national highways
which are well managed and well maintained.
</P>
<P>
Those projects which are of obvious substandard quality will
face criticism and further projects will suffer a decrease in
investment.
</P>
<P>
Those construction enterprises with a bad record in design,
building and poor overall supervision may be deprived of the right
to bid for further work for one year.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Resigns Amid Fraud Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's executive
body resigned Tuesday after a five-person anti-fraud committee
alleged in its report that the European Commission and its members
were responsible for fraud, irregularities or mismanagement in
their services of special responsibility although they had not
personally gained from such cases.
</P>
<P>
"All the commissioners have resigned. We will prepare a
statement to explain the reasons for our resignation," EU
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler told reporters after an
emergency session of the EU executive.
</P>
<P>
The commission's president, Jaques Santer, also announced the
en masse resignation of the 15-nation bloc's law proposing and
implementing arm and day-to-day affairs agency.
</P>
<P>
The EU Committee of Independent Experts, set up on February 2
for the investigation, said in its report that it "did not
encounter cases where a commissioner was directly and personally
involved in fraudulent activities", but found "instances where
commissioners or the commission as a whole bear responsibility"
for the wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
However, the report in its cited cases also pointed out that in
the case of former French Prime Minister Ms. Edith Cresson, it
found the commissioner bears responsibility for one instance of
favorism.
</P>
<P>
"She should have taken suitable steps to ensure that the
recruitment of a member of her staff who would be working closely
with her was carried out in compliance with all the relevant legal
criteria. Subsequently, she should have employed that person to
perform work solely in the Community interest," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report totally cited six individual cases and four
allegations of favoritism cases. Analysts here believe that the
report into allegations of fraud at the EU executive could lead to
a crisis.

<HEADLINE> Albania Welcomes Kosovar Albanian Acceptance of Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government on Sunday
welcomed the Kosovo ethnic Albanian delegation's decision to sign
a peace deal, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Albanian government and its people warmly congratulate the
ethnic Albanian delegation, which agreed to sign on to a
provisional peace agreement tomorrow for the autonomy of Kosovo,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government praised the ethnic Albanian delegation,
saying it "opened up a new page in their history toward peace,
stability and the future."
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government called for the international community
to continue to put pressure upon Belgrade until it agreed to sign
the deal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sali Berisha, head of the opposition Democratic
Party, also made a statement, urging the ethnic Albanian
delegation to sign the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Hashim Thaci, chairman of the ethnic
Albanian delegation, who arrived in Paris on Saturday to attend
the second round of the Kosovo peace conference, announced that it
would sign the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian delegation is resisting a core condition of the
peace plan -- the deployment of 26,000 heavily-armed peacekeepers
under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
NATO in turn is threatening to bomb Serbian targets if
Yugoslavia does not come around, or if its security forces step up
their fight against the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas.

DAKAR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 African Nations' Cup will
be co-hosted by Nigeria and Ghana, the Confederation of African
Football (CAF) announced in its Executive Committee meeting in
Conakry, Guinea on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, hosts of 1978 Nations' Cup, will stage half of the 24
group matches, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the third-
place play-off while the other part of the schedule including the
final will be set for Nigeria, venue of the 1990's tournament.
</P>
<P>
The finals of the biennial competitions, slated for January 23-
February 13, have not been shared before.
</P>
<P>
The CAF stripped Zimbabwe of the right to host the tournament
last month because of the slow pace of construction of the new
stadiums as well as the lack of financial guarantees from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The CAF has withdrawn Ghana and Nigeria from the preliminary
competitions and decided their previous group results will no

<HEADLINE> World's Nuclear Power Firms Develop China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The US's Westinghouse Electric Co.
has joined Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Spain's GNS-Consorcio
in building nuclear power plants in China.
</P>
<P>
Charles Pryor, Jr., President and CEO of Westinghouse, says
that the 3 will act as members of a consortium in bidding and
investing in China. Westinghouse will provide pressurized water
reactors each with a capacity of between 900,000 kw and 1.3
million kw. The other two partners will be responsible for
components like steam generators.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. reached a co-operation agreement on the
peaceful use of nuclear technology a year ago. The U.S. government
will encourage exports to China from U.S. nuclear energy providers
and bank loans and other financial support for nuclear technology
transfers by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the U.S.'s Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave
Westinghouse its first nuclear component license for shipping
almost every component needed in building and operating a
commercial nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Company sources say that the pressured water reactors designed
by Westinghouse have a good safety record.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power accounts for a mere one percent of China's total
power output, as compared with the world's average of 17 percent.
China is making an effort to develop nuclear power energy and
expects to complete 8 nuclear power plants by 2005, bringing the
number of nuclear power plants in the country to 11 with a
combined generating capacity of 8.7 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's plan, the installed capacity of
nuclear power plants in China will be 20 million kilowatts by 2010
and doube that by 2020 .

<HEADLINE> Italy's Aviano Base Workers Urge Revision on Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The 600 Italian civilian employees
at the NATO Aviano Air Base Monday called for a revision of
agreements signed more than 50 years ago governing their working
conditions with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The call is a new voice in the chorus urging a revision of
agreements governing the use of U.S. and NATO bases in Italy
following the acquittal of a U.S. pilot whose Prowler jet sliced
the Mt. Cermis cable-car wire in February last year, killing 20
European tourists.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marine Captain Richard Ashby was acquitted of all charges
by a U.S. military court on March 4.
</P>
<P>
The following day, at a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema made it clear that failure
to place blame for the tragedy would make revision of the
agreements inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"There's a malaise among the 3,500 Italian civilians who work
on U.S. and NATO bases under the agreements," said local trade-
union official Sabrina Parutta.
</P>
<P>
She added that "Italy is re-negotiating the agreements base by
base, and we think the time has come to give these workers a new
juridical standing."
</P>
<P>
According to Parutta, as things stand, the U.S. uses as many as
1,000 U.S. civilians at Aviano, the base from which Ashby's plane
took off before sending the cable's gondola plunging into the side
of Mt. Cermis with 20 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Parutta said employing so many non-European civilians was in
fact a clear violation of regulations governing the use of non-
European labor.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Italian workers employed by the Italian
facilities at the same base said they felt they were "in the
trenches" because of the pressures triggered by the Mt. Cermis
tragedy.

BUENOS AIRES, March 15 (Xinhua)-- Argentina exported to Canada
100 tons of heavy water for use in nuclear reactors, Argentine
National Commission of Nuclear Energy (CNEA) announced Monday.

<HEADLINE> Drug Prescribed to Bulgarian Athletes Contain Banned Substance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A drug prescribed by a Bulgarian
doctor and taken by two Bulgarian athletes was found to contain
substance banned by the International Amateur Athletic Federation
(IAAF), it was known here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Dole, chief of the IAAF's anti-doping commission,
personally notified the Bulgarian Athletic Federation (BTA) of the
finding. The drug named Ginkor Fort prescribed by doctor Angel
Lozanov and taken by athletes Rostislav Dimitrov and Tereza
Marinova contains IAAF-banned simulator heptaminol.
</P>
<P>
Dole undertook to represent the Bulgarian side during the
analysis of the second urine sample. If the initial results are
confirmed in the second test, Dimitrov will be disqualified and
stripped of his silver medal won at the recent world indoor
championships in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Since there is no IAAF limits for the drug, any quantity
established in the body of an athlete will lead disqualification.
</P>
<P>
Heptaminol is a stimulator of the simpaticomimetic amines group.
Apart from increasing the quantity of oxygen in the blood and the
muscles it has a stimulating effect on the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Lozanov told BTA that he recommended the drug on several
occasions and is ready to bear the responsibility. However, he
denied to have prescribed this medicine personally to Rostislav
Dimitrov.
</P>
<P>
Lozanov said that he has attended every meeting of the IAAF
medical commission and heptaminol was not included in an IAAF list
of banned substances provided to the participants at the latest
commission meeting at the Athens world championships in August of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The simulator was included in an extended list of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) as of March 31, 1998. But
this does not imply that it is automatically included in the IAAF'
lists. The IAAF needs meet to automatically adopt IOC's list.
However, the federation has not taken such an action.

LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Fundamentalist Muslim cleric
Sheikh Abu Hamza Al-Masri was arrested in London Monday under
anti-terrorism laws, Hamza's London-based Supporters of Sharia
organization said.
</P>
<P>
Haroon Rasheed, spokesman for Supporters of Sharia, said Hamza
was "arrested for questioning and he is detained at the moment in
connection with terrorism that he is innocent of."
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman said three men were being held after a
series of raids by anti-terrorist detectives but she declined to
say whether Egyptian-born Hamza was among them because no charges
had been made.
</P>
<P>
"This morning at 6:30 a.m. (0630 GMT) officers from the
Metropolitan Police's Anti-Terrorism Branch arrested three men
aged 40, 36 and 39 at various addresses in the west London area,"
the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Hamza is wanted by the Yemeni authorities in connection with an
alleged conspiracy to bomb Western targets and with the kidnapping
of Western tourists three months ago in which four were killed
during a rescue attempt.
</P>

His son and stepson were arrested late last year in Yemen in

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
University's World Institute for Development Economic Research and
Queen Elisabeth House, Oxford, Britain, have just completed a
two-year-long multidisciplinary research project on "The Wave of
Emergencies of the Last Decade: Causes, Extent, Predictability and
Response."
</P>
<P>
The project comprises 40 papers, including a dozen country case
studies which address the root causes, triggers and manifestations
of complex humanitarian emergencies with particular attention to
the significance of such causal factors as economic decline and
worsening inequality, slow growth in food production, inflation,
patterns of past conflict and external economic shocks.
</P>
<P>
Three main authors of the project are expected to give special
briefing on March 22 at the U.N. headquarters, the U.N. Department
of Public Information (DPI) announced Monday. The authors are
Professor E. Wayne Nafziger, Professor Frances Stewart and
Professor Raimo Vayrynen.
</P>
<P>
The policy implications of these findings for preventing or
ending conflicts are also explored, the DPI said. "In this regard,
the project stresses the need for preventive strategies which
address both the political and economic underlying causes of
complex humanitarian emergencies and promote greater political,
economic and social inclusiveness."
</P>
<P>
Complex humanitarian emergencies pose a major challenge to the
international community today, and it was with a view to
stimulating a process of collective reflexion that would contribute
to the formulation of effective responses to this challenge that
this study was undertaken, the DPI said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations University is an international community of
scholars engaged in research, postgraduate training and the
dissemination knowledge to further the purposes and the principles
of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The university has two basic goals: to strengthen the capacity
of institutes of higher learning in developing countries and to
carry out high-quality research and education; and to make
scholarly and policy-relevant contributions to the work of the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, SPD Leaders Deny Sharp Policy Turns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Although Oscar Lafontaine resigned
as finance minister, there will be no sharp turns of Germany's
financial policy, and the business cannot expect more tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and other leaders of the
governing Social Democratic Party (SPD) placated the party's
powerful traditional wing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said on his trip to Copenhagen that the party's goal
was to "make the balance" between supporting the economy and
creating social justice.
</P>
<P>
The SPD's executive committee announced after its meeting in
Bonn that more jobs and more social justice remained the party's
top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mueller, deputy parliamentary leader of the SPD, warned
the SPD would "dig its own grave" if the party yielded too much to
demand from the business.
</P>
<P>
There have been widespread predictions that Schroeder's
government will shift to a more pro-business policy after
Lafontaine's surprising resignation last week.
</P>
<P>
The Greens Party, junior partner in Schroeder's coalition
government, has called for more cuts of corporate income tax,
saying that the corporate tax up to 47 percent in Germany is "not
competitive in a world perspective."
</P>
<P>
It was backed by Wolfgang Clement, North Rhine-Westphalia state
premier from the SPD's moderate wing, who recommended Bonn to
slash the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from next year.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is cutting the corporate tax rate to 45 percent and
to 43 percent from year 2000. Schroeder said he would like to cut
it to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, traditionalists of the SPD, among whom Lafontaine has
enjoyed broad support, keep cooler to Schroeder's call for
pro-business reforms and lash out more at Schroeder's cabinet.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
advanced toward the 10,000 milestone Monday amid new announcements
on corporate mergers.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the Dow was up 82.42 at 9,958.77, less
than 42 points from 10,000. The index came within 30 points of the
new milestone during the session.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was pushed higher by two reports, which sparked stock
prices. Fleet Financial Group acquired BankBoston in 16 billion
U.S. dollars and DuPont will pay 7.7 billion dollars to acquire 80
percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the world's largest
seed corn company.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 12.67 at 1,307.26, also a record and the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 49.91 at 2,431.44.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index was up 3.68 at 615.22 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies was up 2.46 at 400.84. But the American Stock
Exchange composite index was down 0.30 at 720.91.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and decliners were nearly even on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE volume declined to 724.5 million shares from
821.45 million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines Raise Fares for Second Time Since January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- All of the major U.S. airlines
have raised their ticket prices, the second time in less than two
months, said local press reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines started the latest round of increases last
Thursday with a 1 percent increase in business fares and 3 percent
for leisure travelers. It was followed by other major airlines.
</P>
<P>
The previous wave of increases, which began in late January,
raised business fares by 2 percent and leisure fares by 4 percent.
Before that, the industry had not raised prices systemwide in more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue with this momentum, we could see the highest
rates in many moons," said Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares
Discount Travel Magazine.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said that while some of the blame can be
placed on rising fuel costs, high demand for tickets is just as
important a factor.
</P>
<P>
The strong U.S. economy has kept demand up among business
travelers and vacationers.
</P>
<P>
US Airways, for instance, filled a record 73 percent of its
seats last year. The industry average was 62 percent in 1990,
according to the Air Transport Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
Some previous attempts to raise prices in 1999 failed,
primarily because Northwest Airlines was holding out. Northwest
has been having labor problems with flight attendants and
mechanics. This time, Northwest matched the price rise Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices for business travel in the United States have
been rising during the past three years, while most
advance-purchase tickets have fallen.

BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The 15-nation European Union's
Committee of the Regions paid tribute here Monday to Lord Yehudi
Menuhin, the violin virtuoso who died on March 12 in Berlin at the
age of 82.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Europe's regional and local authority
representatives, the committee's president Manfred Dammeyer
expressed his heartfelt loss at the news of Lord Menuhin's death.
</P>
<P>
"Lord Menuhin was a champion of diversity in the broadest
sense. His belief in a society of tolerance and understanding is a
model for what a 21st century Europe should be. He was an
exceptional human being, one of the few people in the world whose
message touches all levels of society," Dammeyer said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that Lord Menuhin had been an active
supporter of Europe's minority cultures and had recently worked
closely with the Committee of the Regions -- the EU assembly of
regional and local representatives -- on a project designed to
highlight their role in Europe's rich cultural tapestry.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Responsible for Fraud, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- An anti-fraud team said here
Monday it had found cases where the European Union's executive
body and its members were responsible for fraud, irregularities or
mismanagement in their services of special responsibility although
they had not personally gained from such cases.
</P>
<P>
The EU Committee of Independent Experts, set up on February 2
for the investigation, said in its report that it "did not
encounter cases where a commissioner was directly and personally
involved in fraudulent activities," but found "instances where
commissioners or the commission as a whole bear responsibility"
for the wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
However, the report in its cited cases also said that in the
case of former French Prime Minister Ms. Edith Cresson, it found
the commissioner bears responsibility for one instance of
favorism.
</P>
<P>
"She should have taken suitable steps to ensure that the
recruitment of a member of her staff who would be working closely
with her was carried out in compliance with all the relevant legal
criteria. Subsequently, she should have employed that person to
perform work solely in the community interest," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report totally cited six individual cases and four
allegations of favoritism cases.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the report into allegations of fraud
at the EU executive could lead to a crisis and spur calls for one
or more commissioners to step down.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Set Up Fraud Prevention Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of the
European Union (EU)'s 15 member states agreed on Monday to set up
a Fraud Prevention Office (FPO) within the European Commission,
the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
During a one-day meeting in Brussels, the ministers made draft
conclusions about the fight against fraud. They believe that the
concern for greater effectiveness should lead to the setting up of
such an agency. They also made a decision to let the FPO replace
the EU executive's Unit on Coordination of Fraud Prevention, known
as UCLAF in EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
The FPO will take over the UCLAF's duties "concerning the
protection of financial interests and the combating of fraud," the
draft conclusion said.
</P>
<P>
"The Fraud Prevention Office will enjoy the broadest possible
operating autonomy. Its director may not seek or take instructions
from anyone in the course of his investigation duties. His
independence of the institutions will be strengthened by the
regular control that will be exercised by a committee made up of
independent outside persons, " the ministers agreed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an independent group of anti-fraud experts said
Monday night, in their first investigation report about EU
conmmission's case, that UCLAF's position within the commission,
as one of the bodies responsible for combating fraud and
irregularities, is less than clear. UCLAF must not act as an
internal auditing service: the majority of its staff do not have
the requisite professional skills.
</P>
<P>
Now, the EU executive's 20 commissioners are facing a probe
into corruption, waste, cronyism and neptism, which analysts said
may lead to step-down of individual commissioner and if that
happened, the commission as a whole will be at stake.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Loyalist Group Admits Car Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The loyalist terrorist group Red
Hand Defenders claimed responsibility Monday for the car bomb that
killed one of Northern Ireland's leading human rights lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The group, which called the BBC in Belfast accompanied by a
recognized code word, said it planted the device that killed
Rosemary Nelson when she was driving away from her home in Lurgan,
County Armagh.
</P>
<P>
The booby trap device ripped her car apart at about 1240 GMT
and injuried her legs. She died in hospital two hours later.
</P>
<P>
Red Hand Defenders is one of the dissident loyalist
paramilitary organizations opposed to the Northern Ireland peace
agreement and was banned earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Red Hand Defenders emerged during the Drumcree crisis last
summer when the loyalist Orange Order was banned from marching
down its traditional route in Portadown. They have been linked to
a series of sectarian attacks on Catholics in various parts of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Some security sources say the group is not all that different
from the Loyalist Volunteer Force, which has called a cease-fire,
and which handed over a small number of weapons to be destroyed as
part of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair called it "a disgusting act
of barbarity."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commercial Banks Set New Earnings Records in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) said Monday that strong contributions from fee
income helped propel full-year earnings for commercial banks to a
new record in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The record profits were achieved despite restructuring expenses
related to mergers and weaknesses in overseas markets that caused
bank earnings to decline in each of the last two quarters of 1998,
FDIC said.
</P>
<P>
Its preliminary data show that the banking industry earned a
record 61.9 billion U.S. dollars for all of the year and 14.9
billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 1998. Full-year results
were 2.8 billion dollars higher than in 1997, a 4.7 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
"This is the seventh year the banking industry has set an
earnings record, and the six year that annual return on assets has
exceeded one percent," said FDIC Chairman Donna Tanoue.
"Profitable banks support the economic growth and prosperity we
enjoy today."
</P>
<P>
The latest results for the 8,774 commercial banks and 1,687
savings institutions,insured by the FDIC, are contained in its
latest Quarterly Banking Profile. The Profile, based on quarterly
reports of condition and income filed by FDIC-insured
institutions, analyzes trends in bank and thrift performance
during the year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new advanced Patriot
PAC-3 missile being developed by Lockheed Martin Corp.
successfully hit a target warhead in a test high over the
country's New Mexico State Monday, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile, an upgraded version
of anti-missile weapons fired at Iraqi Scuds in the 1991 Gulf War,
hit a warhead from a "Hera" missile in the upper atmosphere over
White Sands Missile Range, the department said.
</P>
<P>
It was the third test of the new missile, but the first two
were flight development tests and did not include an attempt to
actually collide with a target missile. Older Patriots, built by
Raytheon Co, carried explosive warheads and did not actually
collide with target missiles like the new PAC-3 is designed to do.
</P>
<P>
The department said 16 more PAC-3 tests are scheduled in
attempts to intercept different types of targets in the U.S.
military drive to develop better defenses against the growing
threat of new ballistic missiles.

Last week, the average price for unleaded gasoline stood at

<HEADLINE> U.S., German Defense Chiefs Warn Milosevic on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and German Defense
leaders said Monday that NATO warplanes were ready to strike Serb
targets if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to let
NATO troops enter into the sovereign province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The handwriting is very much on the wall for him," U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said after his talks with German
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping.
</P>
<P>
Scharping echoed Cohen by warning Milosevic not to harbor any
"illusion about NATO's ability and readiness to act if necessary."
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger told CNN Monday morning
that the United States received a letter from Hashim Thaqi,
chairman of the Kosovar Albanian delegation to the Kosovo peace
talks in Paris, which said the Kosovars were prepared to sign the
peace accord on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that would "shift responsibility very quickly to
Milosevic." "He will be under considerable pressure to sign at
that point, knowing that he does face the undivided (NATO)
coalition that will insist that he be supportive and that the
action order remains in effect," he said after talks with
Scharping.
</P>
<P>
NATO has some 430 attack and support aircraft within striking
distance of Serb targets, including big U.S. B-52 bombers and
radar-avoiding F-117A stealth fighter jets. They were poised for
orders to attack if Milosevic refuses to sign the peace deal,
which forces Serbia to put away its sovereignty over the province
of Kosovo and let foreign troops in to enforce "peace."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, President Bill Clinton made the same threat
to Belgrade with NATO air strikes if Milosevic refuses to concede
Kosovo to NATO's deployment.
</P>
<P>
At the start of a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana, a reporter asked if NATO would launch strikes once
Milosevic failed to sign the NATO-imposed peace deal on Kosovo
while the ethnic Albanians had indicated their endorsement of
that.
</P>
<P>
"If he shows intransigence and aggression I think that from my
point of view we would have little option," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana also said that if the Kosovars agree to sign the peace
deal and Milosevic does not, "the risk of a catastrophe would be
very likely."
</P>
<P>
"I would encourage Mr Milosevic to agree to the terms as well
so that we can avoid further conflict and bloodshed," Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He called the deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo "the best
chance to preserve the integrity of Serbia and avoid economic and
other adversity."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Solana met as peace negotiations were held between
the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians in Paris. Asked how long those
negotiations might run, Clinton said: "I think they ought to be
able to talk this through a little bit -- peace is better than
war. Obviously they can't go on indefinitely."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Bomb Attack in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
condemned a bomb explosion in Northern Ireland as a "despicable
and cowardly act" and called for an end to the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart read a statement about the
car bomb that killed Northern Ireland's Catholic lawyer Rosemary
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
"The killing today of Rosemary Nelson, a leading human rights
lawyer in Northern Ireland, was a despicable and cowardly act by
the enemies of peace," Lockhart said. "Our deepest sympathies go
out to her friends and family."
</P>
<P>
"It is long past time for the bloodshed to end once and for
all. We Urge all the proponents for peace to unite to condemn
this act and reject violence. We urge the parties to move
toward with implementing th Good Friday accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's peace accord was signed last April 10 on
the Good Friday holiday and subsequently approved in the
British-ruled province of Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Britain has set the week of March 29 leading up to this year's
Good Friday as a final deadline for a transfer of some home-rule
from London to Belfast, but politicians are deadlocked over the
pace of guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is to meet Irish and Northern Ireland
political leaders on Wednesday as part of St. Patrick's Day
celebrations.
