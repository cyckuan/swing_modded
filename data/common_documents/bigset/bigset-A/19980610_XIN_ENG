<HEADLINE> Philippine President-Elect Vows to Crack Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President and
President-Elect Joseph Estrada Tuesday vowed to crack down on all
big-time tax evaders, particularly those in the top 200
corporations and the rich class.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Estrada said his administration will not
impose additional taxes, but will concentrate on collecting the
amount due to the government to raise additional funds for the
government.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any intention of increasing taxes but what I have
in mind is to have an official tax collection," he said, stressing
that the government could increase its revenues simply by going
after the tax-evaders, starting with the big corporations.
</P>
<P>
But he explained that a tax amnesty may be granted to those who
will be willing to declare their true net worth and disclose their
actual total assets to enable the government to collect the right
amount of taxes.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever they are, regardless of whoever get hit, we will apply
the full force of the law and see to it that these tax evaders
will go to jail," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the same shall apply to business tycoon
Lucio Tan who is facing tax evasion charges filed by the Bureau of
Internal Revenue, the incoming president said, "Of course there is
no exemption to the rule."
</P>
<P>
He said a one-year grace period shall be given to those who are
willing to declare their actual net worth and their total assets,
but after that, they will be required to pay the full amount of
taxes due.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, however, who among the suspected tax evaders
in the country will serve as an example of Estrada's crackdown and
will face a jail term for failing to pay what is due to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada observed that the Philippines has the lowest tax
collection among Asian countries, due to evasion, adding that "no
less than 90 percent (of the taxpayers) are not paying the correct
taxes in this country."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he vowed to review the tax exemptions given
to several big corporations, noting that this scheme has allowed
these companies to evade the payment of their actual taxes.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of tax exemption is among the controversial
issues raised in the congress during a debate on the Comprehensive
Tax Reform Program, which is strongly opposed by big corporations.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who won the May 11 elections, is scheduled to be sworn
in on June 30 to succeed outgoing President Fidel Ramos.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Sector Booming in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector in east
China's Jiangsu Province maintained its momentum this year, with
production-to-sale ratio and economic returns inching up,
according to information released today by the provincial
statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
All state as well as non-state industrial enterprises with
annual sales beyond 5 million yuan each generated a record 77.3
billion yuan in output value in May, rising 13.8 percent compared
to May of 1997 and rising 4 percent from the previous month this
year.
</P>
<P>
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Jiangsu Province, one of
China's economic leaders, is expected to grow at 11 percent this
year. Industrial processing is the critical part of local economic
setups, so industrial added value is expected to contribute more
than half of the local GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
Among local industrial products, 34 continued big increases in
output this year, especially notebook computers and
program-controlled exchanges rising more than 100 percent and 67
percent in production over last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, the local industrial
production-to-sale rate reached 94.4 percent, 0.1 percent higher
than the same period in 1997. The rate in May of this year hit a
record 95.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the growing industrial output, the slide of
enterprises' economic returns has been checked to some extent, the
report shows.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Secretary of State on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illustrative of the steps taken to realize a "strategic
partnership" is the establishment of a direct telephone "hot" line
between the two governments, Haig said.
</P>
<P>
This telephone link enables the leaders of both countries to
establish a dialogue on critical issues in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
This important new link was first used by President Jiang and
President Clinton last month to explore diplomatic means for
defusing the crisis between Indian and Pakistan, the general said.
</P>
<P>
Since the summit, Haig continued, the defense establishments of
the U.S. and China have initiated an official consultation
mechanism for an exchange of views on international and regional
security issues, including the strengthening of military safety at
sea, by avoiding accidents and misunderstandings that could lead
to improper decisions.
</P>
<P>
"The increases in high level military exchanges between the
countries, as with high level dialogues on political and economic
issues, represent the essence of a 'constructive strategic
partnership,' " he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about how to enhance cooperation while
seeking common ground in areas of differences, Haig said that
frequent high level exchanges between the leaders of China and
the United States are the most important steps that can be taken.
</P>
<P>
"We need to better understand each other in order to find
common ground on issues where historical realities might have
created differences," he said. "Differences cannot be simply
shunted aside in the interest of diplomatic harmony."
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that great nations have their own national
interests which may clash with the interests of other great
nations, Haig said. "However, these differences can often be
managed if addressed prudently in an open-minded and cordial
fashion."
</P>
<P>
"I often think back on the differences that divided us
in the early 1970s. In less than 30 years, consider how far we
have come in addressing differences through communications and
enhanced cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Asked how to increase mutual understanding, Haig said, "I've
never believed that respect was lacking between the Chinese and
American peoples. In fact, the Chinese enjoy the high regard and
admiration of the American people."
</P>
<P>
But, admittedly, there are politicians and leaders representing
narrow special interest groups whose careers have been built by
adopting anti-China rhetorical themes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Misinformation and misunderstandings on the part of individuals
from both countries and from third countries as well need to be
worked on, he added.
</P>
<P>
Progress is achieved through more contacts between peoples, by
visits of Chinese to the United States, Americans to China, by student
exchanges, educational exchanges and by increased communications with
opinion leaders who might unknowingly be spreading misinformation and
half truths, he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Our leaders also need to do a better job in explaining why a
strong, positive U.S.-China relationship is in the interest of not
only China and the U.S., but of the world at large."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Sino-U.S. relationship's impact on regional and
global issues, the general said the positive effects of a
strengthened U.S.-China relationship have been evident on numerous
issues since the two presidents met in October 1997 in Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States have taken leadership roles in
shoring up the economies of several of the Asian countries that
teetered on collapse.
</P>
<P>
"China's unilateral action in aiding the government of Thailand
last year and China's refraining from currency devaluation despite
market pressures have earned great respect.
</P>
<P>
"Just as the U.S. through the International Monetary Fund
sought to shore up the economies of several Asian countries, so
too has China taken the lead in demonstrating its sense of
responsibility as a stabilizing force in the global economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Affirmation of the positive effect of a strengthened U.S.-China
relationship is no more evident than in the cooperation shown
between President Clinton and President Jiang in seeking to
strengthen stability on the South Asian subcontinent following
independent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, Haig said.
</P>
<P>
Haig expressed the view that as the world looks to China and
the U.S. for leadership through the Clinton-Jiang Summit in
Beijing later this month, people should bear in mind the dividends
of peace and stability and unprecedented economic growth that have
been made possible by the strengthened U.S. China relations.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief: More Humanitarian Supplies Reach Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Improved arrangements under
the oil-for-food program for Iraq are facilitating the delivery of
more humanitarian supplies to the country, but problems still
remain, according to a new report of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report showed a general increase in the range and volume of
humanitarian supplies reaching Iraq, but supplies continue to be
erratic. The secretary-general expressed concern that the full
"food basket" was only delivered once to the Iraq's people, and
called for further coordination between the government and the
United Nations to ensure that humanitarian aid applications are
processed in order of priority.
</P>
<P>
Annan also expressed serious concern that a recent survey
carried out by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Program showed "no
measurable difference" in the nutrition status of children under
five compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 percent of all children in that age group were found to
be suffering from chronic malnutrition, 3.1 percent from acute
malnutrition, and 15 percent were underweight.
</P>
<P>
There is positive news in the medical sector, with more drugs
arriving in Iraq'a three northern governorates, according to the
report. However, the secretary-general noted that health centers,
which have to respond to a disproportionate share of emergency
cases, are not always fully staffed or supplied.
</P>
<P>
"To date, observers have reported that most items were not
available in adequate quantities, so that patients were left
either without prescribed medicines or, worse, only part of the
recommended treatment." Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Serious problems also prevail in the water and sanitation
sector, according to the report. "The very poor condition of the
water network, which suffers from frequent breaks and leaks,
especially in southern Iraq, can result in contamination after
disinfection of the water, which reduces the efficiency of the
service."
</P>
<P>
Although supplies are arriving more quickly in the education
sector, shortages remain serious, the secretary-general reported.
Supplies such as school furniture and textbooks are falling far
short of needs, and the report warned that school desks and
textbooks may not be available for distribution at the start of
the next school year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Warns Against Foreign Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian President Boris
Yeltsin Tuesday warned against a possible Western military
intervention in the Serbian province of Kosovo while pledging to
use his influence on Belgrade to seek a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
"Power intervention from outside holds the danger that the
conflict could spread beyond the borders. This would lead to
destabilization in the Balkans with unpredictable consequences for
the whole of Europe," Yeltsin told a press conference after
meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
"The more gently we proceed, the more chances we will have," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that he would meet with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to seek measures to prevent the current
conflict in Kosovo from escalating into a war. But he did not name
the date and venue of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the news conference, Kohl said he and Yeltsin
had agreed to make joint efforts to put a stop to the escalating
violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is our common belief that everything must be done to stop
the bloodshed as soon as possible. Every form of violence must be
rejected," said Kohl.
</P>
<P>
But the chancellor noted that a possible military intervention
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had not been
discussed during his summit with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The German leader also stressed that Germany would continue to
support Russia's reforms led by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the tough measures introduced by the
Russian government to fight financial turbulence would contribute
significantly to increasing the confidence of foreign investors in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Reports said earlier that Yeltsin may use his visit to appeal
to Bonn to back efforts to secure more Western credits to Russia.
</P>
<P>
A German government spokesman, however, said that there was no
plan for a new German aid package to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Germany and other European Union countries would work through
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to help
Russia, Kohl told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is in Bonn along with seven Russian government
ministers to attend the first high-level government consultations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the two-day talks, both sides expressed
satisfaction about the new form of contact. The talks will be held
once a year in the future.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after arriving in Bonn, German and Russian ministers
signed two agreements to promote bilateral cooperation in the
nuclear power industry.

<HEADLINE> PNA Minister: Israeli Occupation Must End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) minister said Tuesday that Israel must end its occupation of
the Palestinian lands to prevent deterioration of the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio over
the telephone from Jerusalem, PNA Minister for Jerusalem Affairs
Faisal Husseini accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
of "attempting to cancel altogether the last stage of the Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu is "sort of manoevering to change the clauses
included in the new U.S. initiative."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed that Israel pull back from 13.1 percent
of the West Bank as a second stage redeployment in return for
PNA's better security guarantee. But Israel rejected the
percentage as too large and resisted any further pullbacks before
the final status talks begin.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said Israel's policy at this stage aims to encircle
Jerusalem with settlements that would isolate the holy city from
the West Bank, adding that "confrontations will not cease so long
as the Israeli occupation continues."
</P>
<P>
Husseini was hit on the head and slightly injured on Monday in
clashes between Jewish settlers and the protesting Palestinian and
Israeli peace activists in a village near the Old City of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli settlers stormed four houses in the Silwan
neighborhood in East Jerusalem Sunday night and claimed they had
bought them from their Arab owners.
</P>
<P>
Israeli peace activists say 16 Jewish families have moved into
Silwan, home to 30,000 Palestinians over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
last year over the construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.

DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 people were injured
Tuesday during clashes in the southeastern port city of Chittagong
between supporters and opponents of a "long march" staged by
Bangladesh's seven-party opposition alliance, a report reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, about 25 vehicles were damaged and several shops
ransacked, the report quoting eyewitnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition started
the two-day long march from Dhaka Tuesday morning toward the
Chittagong Hill Tracts in protest against a peace treaty the
government signed with the tribals last December.
</P>
<P>
As a result of road barricades erected by opponents of the
march and traffic jams, the long marchers could not reach
Chittagong in the evening as scheduled, another report said.
</P>
<P>
They might reach the port city late Tuesday night or early
Wednesday morning, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The march is expected to continue Wednesday morning toward
Khagrachhari, one of the three hill districts, by the major
opposition BNP and toward Rangamati, another hill district, by the
Jammata-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
The seven-party alliance includes the BNP, the
Jammata-e-Islami, the Jatiya Party, the Democratic League, the
National Democratic Party, the Progressive Nationalist Party and

The OAU summit called General Abacha as "a true Pan-Africanist

launching the process of transition aimed at restoring democratic
governance to Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Deplores Excessive Use of Force by Serbian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday deplored the "excessive" use of force by the Serbian
police in Kosovo where a number of ethnic Albanians have been
forced to leave their home.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the implementation of an arms embargo
imposed by the Security Council on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, the secretary-general said that the
situation in Kosovo has continued to remain tense. "Almost daily
violent clashes have occurred along the borders with Albania and
in other parts of Kosovo," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the intensity of the conflict significantly
increased in recent days as a result of the major Serbian police
offensive operation in the southwestern part of Kosovo adjacent to
the Albanian border. "The most recent reports indicate extremely
heavy fighting between the Serbian police and armed groups
believed to be the Kosovo Liberation Army, resulting in the loss
of lives."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general added that the Serbian forces used heavy
weaponry, including mortars and possibly artillery, with several
villages being burnt and destroyed in the town of Decani. "The
latest fighting represents a worrying trends," said the
secretary-general, warning that the further escalation of
hostilities may get out of control and draw neighboring states
into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that the increased number of acts of
violence on both and the heavy presence of the Serbian police,
including special police units and military forces, have generated
insecurity among the local population.
</P>
<P>
He added that to some estimates, more than 42,000 persons,
including Kosovo Albanians and ethnic Serbs, were displaced by the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said he strongly supports the efforts of
those committed to peaceful means to end the conflict in Kosovo.
He urged parties concerned to continue the negotiations started in
Pristina on May 22 in order to lower tensions and stop the spread
of violence.

AMMAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left here
Tuesday for the United States to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Mideast peace process
and bilateral ties.

<P>
The king will discuss with Clinton and other
U.S. administration officials on bilateral relations, ways of

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Dissolves Electoral Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
has dissolved the country's electoral commission to "pave way for
the appointment of a new commission for next year's presidential
and parliamentary elections."
</P>
<P>
However, Monday's premature dissolution of the commission
appointed in September 1994 whose term was expected to expire in
September 1998 has received mixed reactions from other corners,
the Malawi News Agency MANA reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution was timely as it will "give the new commission
enough time to prepare for next year's general elections," MANA
quoted a government spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the electoral commission's chairperson, Justice Anastazia
Msosa and her members have challenged the dissolution as
"unconstitutional and can spark a constitutional crisis," MANA
reported, in a dispatch to Xinhua based here in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"It is a surprise because the constitution does not provide
for the dissolution of either the electoral commission itself or
its members by any person or institution created by the
constitution," Msosa said.
</P>
<P>
"The commissioners can only be removed by the president on
recommendations of parliament's public appointments committee for
incompetence of incapacity or its members automatically leave
office after a four-year term," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson said that before the expiry of a four-year
term of office, nobody has powers to dissolve it unless the
procedures provided by the constitution are complied with.
</P>
<P>
Msosa has put her foot down that following the constitution's
provision, her commission will continue in office until the
expiry of the term.
</P>
<P>
"We view the step taken by the government as an interference
in the work of the commission and has serious consequences on the
independence of the electoral commission and the future of
democracy in Malawi," she added.
</P>
<P>
One of the commissioners, Charles Joya, said it is also wrong
for the president just to dissolve the commission unilaterally
without consultation with other stake-holders.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to consult because everyone has his own
interpretation of the constitution. Therefore, if the president
never consulted with the other players in the electoral process,
it could spark a constitutional crisis," said Joya, apparently
referring to consultation with leaders in opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, in another interpretation, the country's main
opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) has welcomed the
dissolution as "it has cleared the way for stamping out
fraudulent electoral process."
</P>
<P>
The MCP and second largest opposition in parliament, Alliance
for Democracy (AFORD) have on many occasions attacked the
commission for allegedly allowing fraudulent acts by the ruling
United Democratic Front (UDF) during by-elections.
</P>
<P>
"This commission had been toothless, standing aside and
watching while electoral fraud was taking place right in their
face. We can only hope that they will not come back or be placed
by another toothless lot," said MCP President Gwanda Chakuamby.

<HEADLINE> Hemingway Movie to Be Shot in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A film on late American writer
Ernest Hemingway is set to be produced in Kenya later this year,
Sergio Dow, a Colombian film director, told Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The film, entitled "Hemingway: Hunter of Death," is based on a
novel by an Afro-Colombian writer and anthropologist Manuel
Zapata Olivella.
</P>
<P>
Hemingway spent some of his early life in Kenya in 1930s, said
Dow.
</P>
<P>
The story's narrative includes episode derived from Kikuyu (a
tribe in Kenya) legends, said co-producer Charles Simpson, chief
of the Film Studios Ltd., the largest Kenyan firm of this kind.
</P>
<P>
The film, which will also show Kenya's game parks and
wildlife, is estimated to be made on a cost of 10 million U.S.
Dollars, said Simpson.
</P>
<P>
It will also be the first ever film co-produced by Kenya and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
British actor Albert Finney, who starred in the films "Tom
Jones" and "Under the Volcano", has been picked for the leading
role.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has issued 428 filming licenses in the
past two years to boost local film industry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Stock Market in Downturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's stock market, the second
largest in Africa, took a knock Tuesday with the key industrial
index shedding 40 points to close at 7,607 in its first fall in
two weeks, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The market had been active for the past two weeks buoyed by
impressive corporate results posted by some of bourse's leading
counters.
</P>
<P>
Last week's release by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
of the first tranche of a 176-million-U.S.-Dollar balance of
payment credit facility further shored up investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said Tuesday's plunge was precipitated by
doubts, among foreign investors, on the ability of the government
to secure the remaining tranches of the aid.
</P>
<P>
"The market had responded positively to the IMF decision and
the good results achieved by some counters but now there is a
realization in the market that the government might fail to
secure the remaining money because the targets tied to the aid
are too stringent," said one analyst.
</P>
<P>
The targets include reducing the budget deficit, currently
hovering above 10 percent of gross domestic product, to about
five percent and inflation to around 18 percent by the end of the
year from current 26.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a realization that the IMF money will not solve
our problems and this has put a dent on investor sentiment," the
analyst said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladeshi Opposition Soften Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition softened
their stance on a peace accord between the government and tribal
rebels before its planned "long march" toward the country's
southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts which started here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We also favor peace accord... but the one signed (between the
government and the tribals) contains some unconstitutional
provisions which require amendments," Begum Khaleda Zia,
chairperson of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
and leader of the opposition in the parliament, said at a press
conference here recently.
</P>
<P>
The party would amend the "unconstitutional" provisions in the
accord if it comes to power, she added.
</P>
<P>
Since it was concluded in December last year, the treaty has
been under fierce attack from the BNP-led seven-party opposition
alliance.  The alliance has staged various protests, such as
demonstrations, rallies, public meetings and even fasting, to urge
the government to repeal the treaty, on the ground that the accord
"violated the constitution" and "ignored the interest of the
nation."
</P>
<P>
"The (ruling) Awami League acted in haste and... sacrificed
vital national interests," a senior BNP official said.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the protests by the opposition, the Jatiya Sangsad,
the country's parliament, passed four bills in early May giving
legal effect to the treaty in the absence of the BNP, the major
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
It was against such a background that the opposition called the
"long march," which "would represent a strong and unequivocal
protest against the... accord and the passing of the four acts to
implement the accord" and "help provide an awareness" in people's
mind of their "great harm," according to M.M. Rezaul Karim, member
of the Advisory Council of the BNP.
</P>
<P>
The long march is the climax of the opposition's reaction to
the treaty and its softened stance represents a strategic change
on the part of the opposition, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the treaty has in reality put an end to the
decades-long armed conflict in the hill tracts and hence has been
lauded widely both at home and abroad, although the opposition
accused the government of negotiating the treaty with the Chakma
tribe only and ignoring the Bengali community and other tribes in
the region.
</P>
<P>
And with President Shahabuddin Ahmed signing the bills into law
in late May and the Awami League in power, which has claimed the
treaty as one of its major achievements since coming to power in
June 1996, it seems impractical and impossible for the opposition
to have the treaty scrapped, according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to build a peace-loving image and gain more
support from the public, the opposition would probably resort to
legal actions instead of political ones in regard to the treaty
after the long march, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The analysts, however, did not rule out the possibility of
escalating confrontation between the ruling party and the
opposition after the long march, if the procession was blocked and
violent conflicts occurred, which they said might then make the
political situation in the country uncertain.

<HEADLINE> Road Construction Ensures Security: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Tuesday that poor infrastructure is the key factor leading
to insecurity in northern districts.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the function marking the country's
ninth Heroes' Day at an airstrip here.
</P>
<P>
"In the district of Gulu and Kitgum, the army is not fighting
with the bandits. They are fighting more with the delay, the
bush. The bush is the real enemy,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
Constructing roads would be the only way to ensure security in
those areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he had talked with ministers concerned and local
officials about this problem and they promised to repair old
roads and build new ones so that the civilians would be safe from
attacks by rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of Joseph Kony's Lord Resistance Army made frequent
abductions and robberies in these areas recently. The government
ordered a heavy deployment of army to counterattack the rebel
activities.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the rebels, who came from Sudan to get more
supplies, used land mines against civilian vehicles, making the
few roads there nearly impassable.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Ugandans Tuesday marked their ninth Heroes' Day
with various activities in memory of those who sacrificed their
lives or made tremendous contributions to the country's peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
In a short speech, Museveni called on all Ugandans to
contribute to the realization of peace and development of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
He assured Ugandans that the government will overcome its
weaknesses and do everything possible to achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
At a recent donors' conference in Arusha of northern Tanzania,
Uganda had reportedly won western donors' trust with a detailed
plan for construction of main and feeder roads as well as its
booming economy.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Nations Call for Peaceful Settlement to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the Balkan
countries announced Tuesday that the Kosovo issue, which has
caused serious concern in the region, has to be settled through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement issued at the end of the two-day
Balkan Foreign Ministerial Meeting here, the foreign ministers
strongly emphasized the need for resumption of the dialog between
Belgrade and the representatives of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers condemned the escalation of the violence, terrorism
and excessive use of force which costs human lives and
suffering," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed that the consequences of the problem remaining
unresolved could have very negative impact to the process of the
integration of Southeastern Europe and to the peace and stability
of the region," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it quoted Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic as saying that the Kosovo issue is an internal issue of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is subject to internal,
direct and unconditional dialog within the country.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a Xinhua question earlier Tuesday, Jovanovic
said that Belgrade is opposed to any form of foreign military
interference in Kosovo because this issue should be solved
through domestic channels.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania as
well as Turkey attended the meeting on the situation of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed their deep concern over the rapid
deterioration of the situation in Kosovo and reiterated their
full support to the call of the U.N. Security Council for
immediate cease of excessive use of force against civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo issue has been worsening since last February when
bloody clashes erupted between Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
who demand independence from Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Mass Food Distribution Starts in N.W. Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) said here Tuesday that it has begun an emergency
food distribution for more than 100,000 internally displaced
Rwandans in the northwest of the tiny Great Lakes state.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,200 tons of food will be handed out in the
prefectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri in the next two months, said
the WFP in a newsletter available here.
</P>
<P>
In Gisenyi, distribution of 200 tons of food began last week
toward 25,000 people in four communes.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said that heavy insecurity, including frequent rebel
incursions, has plagued much of northwestern Rwanda for nearly
six months, displacing many local people.
</P>
<P>
As a result, WFP and other aid agencies have had only partial
and periodic access to the two prefectures, limiting the amount
of humanitarian assistance that could be sent in, according to
the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, we've only been able to bring in small amounts of
relief food to a few areas," said Gerard Van Dijk, WFP's Country
Director for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Now we hope to reach more remote villages where reports
indicate that displaced people are in urgent need of our help,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
With virtually no access to land for cultivation, and little
money, if any, to buy some of the few foods available in local
markets, the nutritional status of many Rwandans is deteriorating
to alarming levels, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"What's absolutely tragic is that this part of Rwanda has
traditionally been self-sufficient, and at times even produced
surpluses which were sent to other parts of the country," said
Dijk.
</P>
<P>
"But with all the fighting, people have lost their ability to
cultivate, turning a once productive population into food aid
recipients," he continued.
</P>
<P>
WFP now is transporting all its supplies to the insecure
region under military escort.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, while Rwanda was still trying to cope with the
aftermath of the genocide and the return of more than 1.2 million
refugees into the country, WFP provided food aid to an average of
750,000 Rwandans each month.

<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Underdogs Scotland hope to pull off
the first major upset of the World Cup by beating defending
champions Brazil in the opening match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on Tuesday afternoon, Craig Brown,
head coach of the Scottish team, said he hoped to beat Brazil in the
"biggest match" for Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a big match for us and we hope to achieve a good
result," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course the Brazilians are favortes, but we are a disciplined
team with many skillful players. I think we could do better than
four years ago at the Foxboro stadium." Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Former England great Sir Bobby Charlton also tipped Scotland to
pull off an upset:"The Brazilians are favored, but there is a lot of
expectation that they will do well and they will be under pressure
in the first game. Brazil need to perform well and the Scots could
capitalise on that." Charlton said.
</P>
<P>
Asked which teams he thought could win the World Cup, Brown
said:"Brazil, Germany, Spain and France."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Returns Home After Bonn Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to Moscow Tuesday after a two-day visit to Germany that
covered economic cooperation, nuclear proliferation and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's press secretary, told reporters
in Bonn that the visit was a complete success.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Yeltsin won firm support for Russia's economic
reforms from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the wake of the
financial crisis that hit Russia late last month.
</P>
<P>
"Chancellor Kohl's personal support, as a major political
figure in the world, is important that our policies are right,"
Yeltsin told a joint press conference in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kohl praised the steps taken by Moscow to stem
the downturn. "These measures contribute significantly to
increasing the confidence of foreign investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was high up on the agenda during their talks on
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was among the seven
government ministers in Yeltsin's entourage, stressed that under
no circumstances would Moscow sanction the sending of NATO forces
to Kosovo for the stabilization of the situation in the Yugoslav
region.
</P>
<P>
He said only the United Nations has a right to decide on an
operation of international peacekeeping forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Asia following the nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan, Yeltsin and Kohl urged New Delhi and Islamabad to
immediately join the treaties on nuclear non-proliferation and on
the comprehensive ban on nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
A number of agreements were signed in the framework of the
enlarged Russian-German summit consultations.
</P>
<P>
The two country's interior ministries agreed to work together
to fight the rampant car thefts and organized criminal syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed Tuesday in Bonn, Russia and Germany
will sign a contract in the autumn for the supply of 1.2 tons of
highly-enriched uranium to Germany for the Munich-2 experimental
reactor.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Russia's largest trading partner. Bilateral trade
last year reached 32 billion German marks (about 17.7 billion U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Still Hopeful for Reviving Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is still hopeful
that the Mideast peace process can be revived despite the
protracted stalemate, a senior Egyptian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Osama el Baz, political advisor to President Hosni Mubarak,
made the remarks after visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for Near East Affairs Martin Indyk briefed Mubarak on the
U.S. efforts to break the 15-month-old deadlock in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Washington peace initiative, which called for a 13 percent
Israeli second stage withdrawal from the West Bank, has been
rejected by the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Indyk, a former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, came here as part of
U.S. efforts in keeping the Egyptian leader updated with the
latest developments of the situation, Baz said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the U.S. plan of actions in the
coming two weeks, not only on the Palestinian peace track but the
other tracks as well, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear the U.S. administration is determined to pursue
its peace efforts, and is not losing hope on prospects of
activating the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is convinced that the process has not reached a dead
end, Baz said, adding that "what we hear from them is that they
believe it is their duty to exert greater efforts in the coming
phase."
</P>
<P>
Baz denied that Indyk had asked the Egyptian side to convey a
specific message to the Palestinian side. "Cairo has sought to
propel the Mideast peacemaking and secure its success," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause and the first
Arab country that made peace with Israel, has been playing an
important role in mediating the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Indyk, who arrived here early Tuesday, later met with Egyptian
Assistant Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit. U.S. Ambassador to
Egypt Daniel Kurtzer also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Despite the U.S. efforts in forging an agreement on the second
redeployment, the Israelis and Palestinians are still not on the
verge of a breakthrough. Israeli Cabinet discussed the
redeployment issue on Sunday, but no decision was made.
</P>
<P>
While there are signs that Israel is closer to endorsing the
U.S. plan on a 13 percent pullback in the second redeployment, a
new dispute over the third redeployment seemed to have prevented
the Israelis and Palestinians from finalizing a deal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is proposing for an additional 2 percent withdrawal
in the third redeployment, which has been rejected by the
Palestinians as too marginal to be accepted.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Repatriate 6,000 Iraqi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran will repatriate some 6,000
Iraqi refugees under the supervision of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the current Iranian year
(started March 21), an Iranian official announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, director
of the expatriates and foreign nationals department of the
northwestern province of West Azerbaijan Mehdi Abtahi said that
the refugees have requested to return home.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the total, some 3,500 refugees would be
repatriated from his province and the remaining from other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The province now houses 25,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees, of whom
15,000 are staying at "guest towns" (refugee camps) and the rest
in rural and urban areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abtahi said that in the current Iranian year 1,200 Iraqi
Kurdish refugees have returned home while a total of 4,300
refugees returned to Iraq last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Some 580,000 Iraqi refugees, from the Kurdish in the north and
the Shiite Muslims in the south, took shelter in Iran after the
Gulf war in 1991. With the return of calm to Iraq and easing of
tension, more than 550,000 Iraqi refugees have returned home.
</P>
<P>
Abtahi said that the Iraqi Kurdish refugees have been lodged in
five "guest towns" equipped with health and educational facilities
in the cities of Orumiyeh, Piranshahr, Sardasht and Khoy of the
province, which has a border line of about 2,000 kilometers with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the lengthy settlement of Iraqi refugees in
the province, he said, so far 50,000 children have attended
educational courses at various levels while 15,000 adults
attended literacy movement classes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Support South Korean Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Tuesday
affirmed U.S. support for South Korea's economic reforms and
efforts for better relations with the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to welcome South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung at the South Lawn, Clinton said, "America strongly
supports the economic reforms President Kim is pursuing, opening
markets, making financial institutions, businesses and government
more accountable."
</P>
<P>
Kim, who started his nine-day visit to the United States last
Saturday, is seeking U.S. investment to boost his country's
economy which is troubled with the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But he has also another major issue in his mind -- to urge
Washington to loosen sanctions against the DPRK, which he sees as
a new approach for security and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
To the appeal, Clinton reacted to say that his administration
supports "South Korea's efforts to find common ground with North
Korea." But he also put stress on the four-party negotiations,
which comprise two Koreas, China and the United States, "to build
a permanent peace" on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim, in his reply to Clinton's welcome, stressed engagement
with the DPRK to "promote reconciliation and cooperation while
maintaining a strong security posture and coordinating our North
Korean policy with the United States."
</P>
<P>
"I believe U.S. cooperation is crucial for the success of this
policy," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Kim also expressed his hope that the United States would give
more help for his country to tide over the present financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Korea faces its worst economic crisis since the Korean War,
and so eyes and ears of the Korean people are focused on our
meeting today," Kim said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Calls for Netanyahu-Arafat Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Tuesday urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders
to hold a summit in order to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani issued the call upon his returning home from a meeting
in New York with U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told Israel Radio that it would be easier for all the
parties to find a way of advancing the peace talks by arranging a
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, leader of the centrist coalition party The Third Way,
said Ross also favors an Israeli-Palestinian summit as necessary
to achieve an agreement on the second further redeployment of
Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that although a solution to the second
redeployment is near, there are still gaps to be bridged.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the political situation in the region is
sensitive due to the long-running deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been stalled since Israeli started the
construction of a controversial settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem in March last year. The outstanding obstacle blocking
the revival of the process is the dispute over Israeli further
troop pullbacks in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far not formally accepted the American proposal
for a 13 percent handover of West Bank to the Palestinians in the
second redeployment, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who has already endorsed the American compromise
proposal, has ruled out a summit with Netanyahu unless the latter
agrees to accept the U.S. pullback plan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Grant Aid to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the United States Tuesday
signed three agreements under which the U.S. is to grant the
kingdom 79.2 million U.S. dollars economic and development aid.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by Jordanian Minister of Planning
Rima Khalaf, U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Wesley Egan and Director of
the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Jordan
Lewis Lucke.
</P>
<P>
Under the first agreement, the U.S. administration is to
provide 60 million dollars for the Ministry of Water and
Irrigation to upgrade the waste water management systems in the
Jordan Valley, the Red Sea port city Aqaba and the capital Amman
and improve the water supply systems in Amman and some other
selected areas, Jordan's official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the second agreement, altogether 13.5 million
dollars will be provided to support the USAID to carry out its
initiatives in Jordan to increase "economic opportunities" for the
Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Under the third agreement, 5.7 million dollars will be
allocated for Jordan's family planning and public health
activities.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been in serious shortage of water. It currently
needs 4,100 million cubic meters of water per year to meet the
international water-poor country line of 1,000 cubic meters of
water consumption per capita per year.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is also obsessed with the problem of poverty and
its whole population are in urgent need of economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Family planning is also a challenge for the government, for
most of the Jordanian families do not have contraception and
usually have three or more children for each couple. The
kingdom's population increased from 4.1 million in 1995 to 4.3
million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the three agreements brings the U.S. economic
assistance to the kingdom in 1998 to 81.2 million dollars. Total
U.S. aid for Jordan in this fiscal year is expected to reach 140
million dollars, according to Jordan's official news agency.

<HEADLINE> EU Deeply Concerned at Intense Fighting in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Tuesday
expressed its deep concern at the deteriorating violence in
Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo and urged international monitoring
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union said in a written statement that it
strongly condemned a new wave of ethnic cleansing in the form of
widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery attacks on
whole villages.
</P>
<P>
The union insisted on an immediate stop to all violent action
and called for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav special police and
army units from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to condemn," said the EU statement, "any use of
violence for political ends on either side. The European Union is
determined to play its part in stopping the flow of money and
weapons to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)."
</P>
<P>
"Neighboring states have a particular responsibility to ensure
that their territory is not used in support of KLA activity," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union stressed that the priorities in Kosovo are
to end violence and to establish a genuine political process which
is the only viable alternative to continuing conflict.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, European Union foreign ministers, meeting in the
general affairs council, decided to ban all new European
investment in Yugoslavia to protest its use of violence in Kosovo
against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to freeze Belgrade's state-held funds in the
15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers asked the Western military alliance NATO
to speed up its assessment of options for military actions in the
Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Ready to Cut Oil Output, Oil Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Oil Minister of Kuwait Sheikh
Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said Tuesday that his country is ready to cut
its oil production in an effort to boost oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency quoted Saud as describing the move to cut
output as "a necessity dictated by the conditions of the current
market and low oil prices."
</P>
<P>
"The cut is a duty and a sacrifice the OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producing and exporting countries should make," Sheikh added.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait supports the cut as the world market suffers
from a surplus of oil, which has affected prices and the economies
of the oil countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is an issue of common fate between us and other oil
producing and exporting countries," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh made the remarks after a meeting with the visiting
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naimi arrived here Tuesday as part of a Gulf tour designed
to rally support for a tripartite agreement reached last Thursday
in Amsterdam to slash oil output.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait reacted positively Saturday to the agreement involving
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela to cut oil production by
450,000 barrels per day.

<P>
BONN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
said Tuesday that if necessary, NATO should use force to stop
killings in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Bonn, Ruehe said he expected a NATO
defense ministers meeting in Brussels Wednesday would make a
clear-cut decision on the Kosovo issue. All military options must
be examined, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe noted Germany would also send troops if NATO decided to
intervene in Kosovo. However, he stressed that any NATO
intervention would require approval by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the German defense minister, NATO could first
conduct military exercises in Albania and the Repubic of Macedonia
to "send a strong political and military signal" to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the NATO meeting in Brussels should not just
make a symbolic gesture. At issue was how to stop the war as soon
as possible, Ruehe said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn
earlier Tuesday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned against
any outside military intervention in Kosovo, saying that such an
action would lead to escalation and spread of the conflict to the
whole Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leader said he would meet with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to try to seek peaceful solutions.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reactions Greet Nigeria's New Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new government under
General Abudusalam Abubakar has received mixed reactions at home.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official News Agency of Nigeria in Lagos
Tuesday, former head of state General Yakubu Gowon has appealed
to Nigerians to support the new head of state.
</P>
<P>
"Let us, as Nigerians, be noble and see what we can do in
making sure that we give our new head of state the support that
he needs so that he can move this country forward and so that we
can achieve that hopeful return to democracy that we call pray
for," Gowon said.
</P>
<P>
Gowon, who led Nigeria through its 30-month civil war in the
1960s, was reportedly on his way to Kano to condole with the
family of late head of state General Sani Abacha, who died of a
heart attack early Monday.
</P>
<P>
He urged Nigerians to give Abubakar a chance, saying that "he
may have problems. He may have his own style. Let us give him a
chance to be able to do it and to do it well."
</P>
<P>
On the former leader Abacha, Gowon said that "he has done his
best. When you are in that position, it is the most uneasy place
as the saying -- the head is like a dustbin -- every sort of
rubbish is piled on him, but he got to do his best to God and
history. So let us mourn the loss of the head of state..."
</P>
<P>
Apparently on the jubilation of some people over Abacha's
death, Gowon said that "we say negative things about anyone who
has died. Let us remember that there is God Almighty who sees
and hears. He is the judge. Let us not be the judge."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, media reports quoted Nigeria's major opposition
group, the United Action for Democracy, as saying that it rejects
the appointment of General Abubakar as the new leader and plans
to go ahead with a demonstration Friday calling for the end of
military rule in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's highest ruling body, the Provisional Ruling Council,

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Ready to Cut Oil Output, Oil Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Oil Minister of Kuwait Sheikh
Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said Tuesday that his country is ready to cut
its oil production in an effort to boost oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency quoted the minister as describing the move
to cut output as "a necessity dictated by the conditions of the
current market and low oil prices."
</P>
<P>
"The cut is a duty and a sacrifice the OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producing and exporting countries should make," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait supports the cut as the world market suffers
from a surplus of oil, which has affected prices and the economies
of the oil countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is an issue of common fate between us and other oil
producing and exporting countries," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after a meeting with his Saudi
counterpart Ali Al-Naimi.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naimi arrived here Tuesday as part of a Gulf tour designed
to rally support for a tripartite agreement reached last Thursday
in Amsterdam to slash oil output.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait reacted positively Saturday to the agreement involving
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela to cut oil production by
450,000 barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes EU Decision on Fresh Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An official at the Iranian Foreign
Ministry on Tuesday voiced Tehran's welcome to the decision made
by foreign ministers of the European Union (EU) to hold fresh
talks with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted the unnamed
official as saying that in light of the EU bid to shift from its
former stand adopted as a result of its unfounded charges against
Iran, Iran would consider the decision and announce its views on
the time and level of the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Iran would make its decision on the
agenda of the talks, adding that the subjects of the fresh talks
would be different from the former ones and the EU would be
informed in advance.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers said in Luxembourg on Monday that
they would start fresh talks with Iran this month. But they did
not say what to be discussed with Iran.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the EU has blamed Iran for the death
sentence on the British writer Salman Rushdie for his
controversial novel "the Satanic Verses," Tehran's stances on
the Middle East peace process, international terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, the European countries rejected Washington's call for
isolating Iran, pursuing a "critical dialogue" with Tehran in a
bid to milden the Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
Following the election of the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami last year, the EU countries were encouraged to reopen new
talks with Iran to boost cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that the future discussion between Iran and the EU
would focus on issues consistent with the Organization of the
Islamic Conference currently chaired by Iran, the status of
Muslims in Europe and the approach of the European states toward
the cultural values of the Muslim world and the Iran-EU
cooperation in political, economic and cultural grounds.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls to Help Injured, Displaced people </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Tuesday called on
local and foreign humanitarian organizations to provide aid to
people injured and displaced by the present border conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission said in addition to those displaced by
the conflict, there are also Ethiopians driven out from Eritrea
after all their properties were confiscated by the Eritrean
forces.
</P>
<P>
The statement said although the Ethiopian government provided
various aids to help war victims and displaced people, the rise
daily in the number of displaced people has necessitated
additional service of assistance.
</P>
<P>
It said local and foreign humanitarian agencies requested to
provide grain, cereal, nutritious food, condiments, clothes,
blankets, tents, plastic sheets, various utensils, water drums
and tankers, jerry-cans, medicines, medical equipment and other
necessary materials.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, the number of displaced people in
Tigray region now stands at 126,000.
</P>
<P>
An a similar development, the Ethiopian parliament Tuesday
passed a resolution addressed to the international and African
parliaments about the massacre of children and elders by Eritrean
air-raids on June 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said, the parliaments should consider the
brutal act by the invading forces on defenseless children and the
civilians in a similar way to war crimes committed in Rwanda and
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Mourns Death of Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
declared a day of national mourning Tuesday to mark the death of
Nigerian leader General Sani Abacha, a report from Monrovia said.
</P>
<P>
Government offices, business houses, banks and stores shut
their doors in observation of the day, while school authorities
sent pupils home.
</P>
<P>
Taylor declared the day of mourning in a solemn radio
broadcast where he described Abacha, who reportedly died of a
heart attack early Monday, as a "champion of peace" and "a true
son of Africa."
</P>
<P>
Taylor ordered the national flag to be flown at half mast
throughout Liberia from dawn to dusk.
</P>
<P>
"We laments and mourn the untimely home-going of General
Abacha," Taylor said in his broadcast late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the general was a true son of Africa, who,
undoubtedly dedicated his life to the enhancement of sub-regional
(west African) peace and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor extended sympathy to Abacha's widow, Maryam and his
children with whom "my family and I spent many memorable moments,
and came to know very well."
</P>
<P>
He expressed "great sympathy with the people of Nigeria, and
especially those we are with us as relatives, friends and
partners-in-progress."
</P>
<P>
Taylor expressed his gratefulness to late General Abacha, who
as the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), has helped tremendously in bringing Liberia's seven
years of civil war to an end in 1997.
</P>
<P>
When the ECOWAS peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG was first
sent to Liberia in 1990 at the breakout of the civil war, it was
the troops of Taylor, a major warlord then, that gave ECOMOG the
strongest resistance.
</P>
<P>
But it is also under ECOMOG's supervision that Taylor emerged
the winner of a free and peaceful presidential election in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
Taylor told the ECOMOG troops now still in Liberia, "you have
lost a very fine commander-in-chief. You have my deepest
sympathy. You must continue to hold your heads up high, your
shoulders square and remain undaunted in the completion of your
noble task of peace-building in our sub-region."
</P>
<P>
"We shall remain indefinitely grateful for the tremendous
sacrifices that General Abacha made in restoring peace and
normalcy to our country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Destruction of Churches in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has strongly protested to
the U.N. over the desecration of churches in the island's northern
part controlled by Turkish Cypriots, Cyprus News Agency (CNA)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CNA quoted a letter, addressed to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan by Cyprus' U.N. Permanent Representative Sotos
Zackheos, as saying that two churches in northern Cyprus have
been converted into mosques and a third has been turned into
a cultural center.
</P>
<P>
The letter noted that "the repeated illegal conversions are in
violation of the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural
Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the Declaration of the
Principles of International Cultural Cooperation adopted by the
UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization) General Conference."
</P>
<P>
It said that "these acts are promoted by Turkey within the
framework of its expansionist plans against Cyprus and are a
further example of Ankara's complete disrespect for other
people's cultural heritage and its religious intolerance."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot diplomat underlined that these acts of destruction
are systematic and "part of a deliberate plan to obliterate the
island's religious, archaeological and historical heritage."
</P>
<P>
"Although the policy of the Government of Cyprus is to protect
and maintain all cultural, historical and religious monuments in
Cyprus, this policy is unfortunately not adhered to in the
illegally occupied areas controlled by the Turkish troops, where
my government has no control," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot HIV Carrier Jailed for Unprotected Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot man infected with the
lethal Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was sentenced Tuesday to
one year imprisonment on charges of having unprotected sex and not
informing his sexual partners about his condition.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Nicolaou, the 28-year-old waiter in southern coastal
town of Larnaca, was found guilty of having sexual intercourse with
two women in a way that could possibly infect them with the HIV,
the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) virus, according to
the verdict of Larnaca District Court.
</P>
<P>
The court heard that Nicolaou's fiance has contracted the HIV
from him, but she has pardoned him. They had a relation before
1993, when he was tested HIV positive, and to their knowledge
they continued having unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
The second woman, a married mother of three, had unprotected
sex with the defendant twice, but she was not aware of his
disease.
</P>
<P>
The court decision stressed the social commitment of an AIDS
patient, noting that Nicolaou expressed repentance too late.
</P>
<P>
He was the third person in Cyprus charged with knowingly
passing the AIDS virus under a 50-year-old law introduced by
the island's then British colonial authorities to combat the
spread of cholera and typhoid.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Famagusta District Court sentenced a fisherman
to 15 months in jail for negligently passing HIV to his British
lover.
</P>
<P>
In April, a 26-year-old woman, who has full-blown AIDS,
received a seven-month imprisonment after she had pleaded guilty
before the court for having unprotected sex with two young men
without informing them of her disease.

<HEADLINE> Global Action Needed to Reduce Drug Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Global action is needed to
reduce the ability of criminals to hide illegal profits from drug
trafficking, according to a U.N. report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its report on Financial Havens, Banking Secrecy and
Money-Laundering, the U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime
Prevention said most money-laundering schemes involve the use of
financial havens.
</P>
<P>
Finding criminally derived incomes and assets has been made
more difficult because of the dollarization of black markets,
financial deregulation, the progress of the Euro market and the
proliferation of financial havens, the 118-page report said.
</P>
<P>
The annual turnover from drug trafficking is estimated at 400
billion U.S. dollars, but the law enforcement efforts recover only
100 million dollars to 500 million dollars each year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report introduced anti-money-laundering proposals such as
tighter regulation of offshore banking and casinos, more efficient
exchange of financial information between countries, improved
training for financial investigators, and increased controls over
international business corporations.

JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Assembly Tuesday passed a legislation to extend the life of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), according to Justice
Minister Dullah Omar.
</P>
<P>
The new bill will allow the TRC to submit an interim report on
October 31 this year, and enable its Amnesty Committee to conduct
more than 1,000 outstanding amnesty application hearings, South
African Press Association quoted Justice Omar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Omar introduced the bill.
</P>
<P>
After October 31, the TRC will be suspended while its Amnesty

Once the committee's work is complete, President Nelson

final report.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, an amendment to the original act setting up the TRC,
the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Bill, extended
the life of the Amnesty Committee to June 30 this year, and set
July 31 as the date for the final report of the TRC.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Officer Sparks Debate by Slamming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Israeli Army
officer in South Lebanon sparked a heated debate in the Knesset
(Parliament) Tuesday by slamming demonstrators supporting
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent protests held in Tel Aviv calling for a
unilateral pullback from Lebanon, Israeli Army's Liaison Commander
in South Lebanon Erez Gerstein on Monday strongly criticized the
demonstrators for endangering the lives of Israeli soldiers as
well as the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
In their reactions, protest organizers, the Four Mothers
Movement and the Movement for a Peaceful Departure from Lebanon
(MPDL), defended their actions, saying they were just exercising
their civil rights. They demanded that the army should stay out of
political matters in a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak, in his final
briefing to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, was
forced to reprimand Gerstein for going "out of line" to openly
criticize the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli citizens have the legitimate rights to express their
views on all subjects," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said he believes Gerstein was speaking out of concern
over the security of Israeli and SLA soldiers in South
Lebanon. He added that Gerstein was "an excellent officer" and he
would not be relieved from his post.
</P>
<P>
A political uproar was created in Tuesday's Knesset, where
lawmakers from the ruling and opposition camps traded blames over
Gerstein's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Ran Cohen of the opposition Meretz party said the "horrible"
remarks made by Gerstein could not be accepted by anyone who
believes in democracy. "We are not going to live in Israel while
we send our sons to the army but have no possibility to speak out
our opinions about the ways of fighting in Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Gerstein should be dismissed because of his
irresponsible statements.
</P>
<P>
Labor's Knesset member and MPDL leader Yossi Beilin, joined by
his party colleagues Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, Yael Dayan and Haggai
Merom, came out in support to Cohen. They all criticized Gerstein
for violating the civilian rights.
</P>
<P>
But Uzi Landau, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee and a lawmaker of the ruling Likud party, voiced his
full support to Gerstein, although he conceded that army officers
should stay out of political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one Labor lawmaker crossed the party line to
support Gerstein. Ephraim Sneh said that if the citizens have the
right to intervene in the army's affairs such as the security
issue, then an officer also has the right and duty to voice
concern over the security of his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The continued debate in Israel over a unilateral withdrawal
from South Lebanon pointed to the deep division among Israeli
society over the sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the so-called South Lebanon Security Zone in 1985
after it withdrew the bulk of the 1982 invading forces from
Lebanon. The zone has since become a death trap for Israel, with
an average 35 Israeli soldiers being killed there every year in
fightings with the anti-Israeli Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrilla
forces. Six Israeli soldiers and at least nine SLA militiamen have
been killed since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Under growing domestic pressure for a pullout, Israel's Cabinet
adopted last April the 20-year-old United Nations Resolution
425 calling for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from South
Lebanon, but linked the pullout to a security arrangement.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon and its powerful ally Syria rejected Israel's
conditional offer, saying the U.N. resolution demands an
unconditional withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Mourns Death of Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Tuesday sent a message of condolences to the government and the
people of Nigeria at the sudden death of general Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The message said the president extended sincere and heartfelt
condolences to the Nigerian government and to the bereaved
families.
</P>
<P>
Abacha ruled Nigeria for four and a half years before he died
reportedly of cardiac arrest Monday morning at the age of 54.
</P>
<P>
There had been reports on his poor health although officials
denied there was any problem with his health.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was buried later in the day in keeping with Islamic
custom. The burial took place in Abacha's home town Tenno in the
north of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says New Nigerian Leader Capable of Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
that Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdusalam Abubakar, was capable of
leading the country on the way to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
"We generally regard him as someone who's capable of taking
this historic decision and we very much want him to do so," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States was considering to revive the idea of
a diplomatic mission to Nigeria, which was called off earlier this
month because the Nigerian government said it would receive the
diplomats only if Washington lifted some visa restrictions.
</P>
<P>
"We were not prepared to meet the conditions the previous
government had set for such a meeting so the fact of a new
leadership opens the opportunity for them to permit such a mission
and that's certainly under consideration," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said the United States was pleased to
see Nigeria is calm following the death of its leader Sani Abacha,
and that it hoped the country would move to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that Nigerians have reacted calmly to
the death of Abacha. And we think it's very important that Nigeria
move forward in the transition to civil rule, democratic
elections, as Nigeria has committed itself to do by October,"
White House spokesman Eric Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, 54, died of heart attack Monday and Gen. Abubakar,
chief of the defense staff, was sworn in Tuesday to succeed him.

<P>
Reports said five people were severely injured and about 25

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Back Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- France has expressed its readiness to
back and join a possible military intervention in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo by the NATO.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Tuesday echoed President
Jacques Chirac's statement made in New York Monday that France
will in principle support such a military action, although it
should be decided by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"France is ready to take its part of all necessary answer to
avoid the repetition of a tragedy which we experienced in former
Yugoslavia," said Jospin when he made a brief visit to Lisbon,
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry officials from the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy will meet in Paris Wednesday to
prepare for a ministers' meeting of the six nations on Kosovo to
be held on June 12 in London.
</P>
<P>
They will make proposals of "political and military character"
to the United Nations, said French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Britain will present a draft U.N. resolution on solving the
Kosovo crisis, to which France will give its support.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of discussing with the British the exact
text," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Germany has so far expressed reservation over a military option
in Kosovo and prefers to use economic and diplomatic means to
exert pressure, while Russia is also opposed to the use of force.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Keep Silence on Missile Issue: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- In a move to divert the attention
on its controversial plan to deploy anti-aircraft missiles,
Cypriot government said Tuesday it would no longer make comments
on the issue in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a National Council meeting,
government spokesman Christos Stylianides said "the very nature of
the matter demands that the issue is kept out of the limelight."
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate this, Stylianides declined to comment on recent
reports in the Russian press that the Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles have already been delivered secretly to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Russian daily "Sevodnya" reported that the S-300s have already
been deployed on the island and more than 200 Russian
specialists were helping install them.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides' statement came following a British newspaper
report that Britain had a "contingency plan" to airlift 250,000
people from Cyprus for fears of a war if the Cypriot government
goes on with its plan to deploy the missiles later this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus fears that the reported British plan would adversely
affect the island's tourism and damage its economy.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government decided to purchase the Russian missiles
in January 1997, which are expected to be delivered in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third in the aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept around 40,000 troops in northern Cyprus, which
was declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as a
breakaway "Turkey Republic of Northern Cyprus" which was recognized
only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot-Russian missile deal was opposed by the U.S.,
Britain and some other countries. Turkey has threatened to
destroy the missiles if they are deployed.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR-Africa Coop Successful: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The cooperation between the
United Nations and Africa in trying to find durable solutions to
refugee crises in the continent has continued to be close despite
difficulties in this regard, a senior U.N. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is important to realize that a lot of resolutions have been
planned to the refugee problems in Africa, Sadako Ogata, U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
Ogata is here for the current 34th summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) as an observer.
</P>
<P>
This is the seventh times that she has attended the OAU summit
before the end of her mandate later this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to carry out a very successful repatriation
exercise to Mozambique, now followed by the return of Malian
refugees from Burkina Faso and Mauritania. Togolese refugees
have also been assisted to return home and re-start life," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In sp these, there is still a serious outflow of
refugees in Africa, with the largest in Sierra Leone, where a
military coup in May last year has created social chaos in that
tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
According to Ogata, some 230,000 new refugees have fled Sierra
Leone to neighboring Guinea and Liberia, bringing the total
number to about 530,000 since the civil war began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that the current situation in Sierra Leone would not
be affected by the sudden death of Nigeria's Head of State
General Sani Abacha Monday morning, whose troops have led a
successful peace keeping operation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The basic cause of Africa's refugee problems has been internal
conflict based on ethnic and tribal divisions, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she expressed fear that the fragile peace in
countries like Liberia and Rwanda would affect the repatriation
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
On the recent escalating conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea, the U.N. official said she did not believe it would
produce refugees in the Horn of Africa at present.

<HEADLINE> Intel Corp to Cut Chip Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. is stepping up the use
of pricing as a weapon to protect its biggest business and to
expand into new markets.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the giant chip
maker dropped prices by 12 percent to 32 percent on its flagship
Pentium II microprocessors Monday, the third cut this year as
Intel reacts to slowing demand for personal computers and to
rivals at the low end of the market. Microprocessors act like the
heart of PCs, and Intel dominates the field with about 85 percent
of the market.
</P>
<P>
Intel is also attracting attention by slashing prices in its
newest business, chips used to display graphics on PCs.
</P>
<P>
The developments come as the Federal Trade Commission filed a
long-awaited anti-trust suit focusing on the way Intel allegedly
uses its monopoly power to bully customers into sharing their
intellectual property with Intel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they were more concerned with the sluggish
personal computer market, price cuts, pressures on profits and
some losses in Intel's dominant market share than with its legal
battle with the FTC, which could drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest Inc. said Intel had 93.2 percent of the 20.1 billion
U.S. dollar market for PC microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that Intel is really facing increased
competition and that competition is not likely to abate in the
next couple of years.

<HEADLINE> OPIC Plans to Resume Trade Investment to S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC) plans to resume trade investment in
South Korea as a result of improvement of worker rights there,
administration sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was expected to be made after South Korean
President Kim Dae jung's talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton at
the White House, they said.
</P>
<P>
The OPIC, an independent government agency that helps U.S.
companies invest in emerging markets, suspended its program in
South Korea in 1991 because of its concerns over worker rights.
</P>
<P>
The agency, however, has now determined that conditions have
improved for workers in South Korea, thus clearing the way for
resumption of investment.
</P>
<P>
The OPIC provides financing of businesses through loans and
loan guarantees, insures investments against political and other
risks, and supports private investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The agency must still conclude negotiations with Seoul on a
bilateral agreement before its new program gets underway.
</P>
<P>
The White House may also announce the expansion of U.S.
Export-Import Bank support for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been in talks with Kim's government on providing
additional financial support for U.S. export sales to South Korea,
a White House spokesman said.

PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian squad experienced a moment

He collided with a teammate who was trying to prevent him from

<P>
The Nigerian striker had treatment with ice pack on his knee before

<HEADLINE> IMF Set Forth Package Proposals for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has urged Africa to frame its economic policies and
integrate itself with globalization for a sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
With market integration proceeding rapidly, Africa must open
up and compete if it is to take advantage of the benefits of the
globalization process while at the same trying to avoid the risk
of marginalization and the risk of capital flows drying up or
reversing, an IMF official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, IMF Managing Director, said this to African
leaders who are attending the 34th Summit of Heads of State and
Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief set forth a package of proposals which he
thought would enable Africa to maximize the benefits of
globalization while avoiding its perils.
</P>
<P>
These include consolidating macro-economic stability, ensuring
economic security, strengthening the financial sector, speeding
up trade liberalization, fostering efficient regional economic
cooperation and integration, a good governance and a broad,
frontal attack on structural problems.
</P>
<P>
Africa must now redouble efforts to reduce inflation to
sustained low rates and ensure the viability of the external
position, he said, adding that it must also mobilize savings and
deepen financial intermediation.
</P>
<P>
It must also strengthen everything that encourages private
investment and the entrepreneurial spirit at all levels, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, industrial countries should do more to open
their markets to products in which African countries have, or are
likely to develop, a comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
IMF, meanwhile, will also continue to support the reform
efforts of Africa by providing more loans and moving swiftly to
implement the debt initiative for the heavily indebted poor
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism over the economic progress in Africa.
</P>
<P>
After some two decades of lost opportunities, Africa's
economic performance has improved and the outlook has brightened,
he said. Real GDP for the region as a whole is growing at 4 to 5
percent, and per capita incomes are on the rise. And more and
more African countries are partaking in the economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> U.S. GM Shuts Down 5 Assembly Plants Amidst Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A strike at a General Motors
Corp. parts factory closed five assembly plants and idled about
15,000 workers Tuesday, according to an AP report.
</P>
<P>
Assembly plants in Michigan, Kansas, Ohio and Ontario were
idled because of a parts shortage caused by the strike by nearly
3,400 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) at GM's Flint Metal
Center, north of Detroit. The plant makes hoods, fenders, doors
and other sheet-metal parts.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators representing GM and the UAW resumed talks Tuesday
on the fifth day of the Flint strike, which largely involves
disputes over work rules and staffing levels. But there was no
progress achieved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Due to shortages of parts cut-off for a variety of GM's light
trucks and full-size cars, the five of GM's 16 plants shut down in
North America include:
</P>
<P>
-- The Orion Township plant outside Detroit, where about 2,800
hourly workers were sent home. The plant makes five full-size
cars: the Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and Aurora, Buick Riviera and
Park Avenue, and Pontiac Bonneville;
</P>
<P>
-- The Fairfax plant in Kansas City, Kan., which makes the
Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue. The shutdown affected
2,900 workers;
</P>
<P>
-- The Moraine, Ohio, plant, where about 4,300 workers were
idled. The plant makes GM's midsize sport utility vehicles,
including the Chevrolet Blazer;
</P>
<P>
-- The plant that makes the Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo at
GM's big Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, complex, where about 2,800
workers were affected;
</P>
<P>
-- The Buick City car assembly plant in Flint, where about
2,100 workers were sent home. The plant makes Buick LeSabre and
Pontiac Bonneville sedans.
</P>
<P>
The strike's effects were spreading to other parts plants as
well. GM's Delphi Interior &AMP; Lighting plant in Auburn Hills was
closed, affecting 210 workers, Delphi Automotive Systems spokesman
Ray Deibel said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
UAW officials in Flint said they also expected the Flint truck
and bus plant to close Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the UAW threatened to stage a strike at a second
parts plant in Flint Thursday if no settlement is reached. The
Delphi-Delco complex, with about 5,800 hourly workers, makes
instrument panels, spark plugs and other parts used in nearly all
GM cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
GM's cost-cutting and plant closures over the past two decades
have resulted in the loss of about 50,000 jobs in Flint, and
workers at the Metal Center fear their jobs may be next. The Flint
plant is among the least competitive within GM, according to the
Harbor Report, an independent ranking of the efficiency of North
American auto plants.

<HEADLINE> UAE President Urges Agreement on Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Tuesday called for an agreement among Arab countries on holding a
summit with an aim to collectively meet various challenges facing
the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
The UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan made the
call at a meeting here with visiting Saudi Prince Sultan Ibn
Abdul-Aziz, second deputy prime minister and minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed voiced the hope that the proposed summit would be
held regularly and yearly with a view to "ensuring the Arab joint
action."
</P>
<P>
He called for rapprochement, solidarity and unity among all the
22 Arab countries instead of divisions and differences.
</P>
<P>
As for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Sheikh Zayed said
the GCC members should exert every possible effort to support the
Arab causes and restore the solidarity of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out to the necessity of "the principle of
collectiveness," rather than individualism, in dealing with the
GCC-Iran relations.
</P>
<P>
The issue of three disputed islands in the Gulf, namely, Lesser
and Greater Tunb and Abu-Musa, between the UAE and Iran is an
inseparable part of the GCC concerns that should be negotiated
with Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim sovereignty over the islands near
the strategically important strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince arrived here Monday on an official visit.

<HEADLINE> UNIP Party Demands Kaunda Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kunada's party demanded here Tuesday that Kaunda be acquited.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Legal Affairs of the United National
Independence Party (UNIP), Mwangala Zaloumis, told a press
conference that UNIP is disappointed at not acquitting its leader
Kaunda but entering nolle prosequi by the government when Kaunda
was set free on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Zaloumis, who is also Kaunda's lawyer, said the team of
Kaunda's lawyers had wanted the case to be quashed as there was
no evidence which linked their client to the October 28 failed
coup.
</P>
<P>
She said Kaunda is demanding that he should be prosecuted
because he is innocent and the government's decision to enter a
nolle prosequi is not enough.
</P>
<P>
Even if the government has released Kaunda on the spirit of
reconciliation, the nolle prosequi was done in bad faith, she
said.
</P>
<P>
UNIP is unhappy at the statement by Legal Affairs Minister
Vincent Malambo, who said last Thursday that the decision to
enter a nolle prosequi does not mean that the government has no
evidence against Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Malambo also said that because it is not appropriate to
prosecute Kaunda, he has been freed.
</P>
<P>
Zaloumis accused the government of fabricating lies connecting
Kaunda to the coup.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested on December 25 of 1997 but transferred to
under house arrest six days later following an international cry
for his immediate release or charging him.
</P>
<P>
On January 10, 1998, Kaunda was charged with conspiring with
some army officers to topple the government and one month later
he was formally charged with misprision of treason.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Council Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The newly-formed governing council of
the European Central Bank (ECB) convened its meeting Tuesday at
the bank's headquarters in Frankfurt to prepare for the launch of
the single European currency, the euro, on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The council comprises the ECB's six board members as well as
the central bank chiefs of the 11 European Union states which will
join the euro in the first wave next year.
</P>
<P>
According to ECB President Wim Duisenberg, among a number of
organizational decisions made Tuesday, the council fixed the
capital participation in the ECB for each member states, with the
German central bank holding the largest stake.
</P>
<P>
Until July 1 this year, the ECB would have four billion euro in
startup capital, Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
The ECB meeting also made clear that the 11 national central
banks would be responsible for the supply of the first euro
banknotes. Meanwhile a special panel has already been set up to
fight forgeries.
</P>
<P>
The ECB council also decided to meet on the first Tuesday of
every month in the future. Key issues such as the minimum reserves
of the bank and which monetary instruments would be used would be
discussed in the following months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after the meeting, Duisenberg
said that judging from the overall monetary situation of the euro
member states, he saw no major risks for the launch of the euro.
</P>
<P>
A formal founding ceremony for the ECB is scheduled for June 30
in Frankfurt.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Death Rates in UK to be Made Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Patients of the state-run health
service are to have access to information about the level of death
rates in individual hospitals before going for operations, the
British government announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Labor members of parliament, Health Secretary
Frank Dobson said people have a right to compare their local
hospital's performance with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary clinical indicators for hospitals in England would
be published from next October as a step to boosting public
confidence in the service, he said.
</P>
<P>
The figures will show how many patients die in different
hospitals after operations, heart attacks and broken hips, and how
many suffer complications.
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals and hospital doctors need to know these figures - so
too do patients and their GPs (general practitioners)", Dobson
said.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a public outcry at the deaths of 29 babies
and children after heart operations at a hospital in Bristol, a
far higher death rate than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Dobson said doctors will also be monitored properly to improve
the standard, but patients will not see this information.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denounces Jewish Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Royal Commission for
Jerusalem Affairs Tuesday denounced the seizure of Palestinian
houses by Jewish settlers and called on the Israeli government to
commit itself to the agreements it has already signed with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement concerning the Israeli settlers' take-over
of a pair of Palestinian buildings in Arab East Jerusalem on
Monday, the commission said that the Israeli government,
particularly the Western Jerusalem Municipality, was held
responsible for the "illegal act, which undoubtedly proves that
the Israeli settlement program is going ahead under the
government umbrella to complete the judaization of the Holy
city."
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that Israel, through its continued
settlement program in Jerusalem and other areas, "plans to
impose the de facto situation on the Palestinian side when the
final status negotiations begin."
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords and other Palestinian-Israeli
agreements, the issue of Jerusalem will be discussed in the final
status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The statement finally called on the international community to
exercise further pressure on Israel to honor the U.N. resolutions
and the agreements it signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, dozens of armed Jewish settlers moved in the Arab
East Jerusalem and took over five apartments in two buildings in
the Silwan neighborhood adjacent to the Al Aqsa Mosque. At least
two people were injured as the Palestinians clashed with the
settlers.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Aims at Eliminating Opium Production in 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is determined to
achieve its goal of total elimination of poppy growing and opium
production in 15 years, Home Minister Tin Hlaing said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going U.N. special session on drugs, he said
Myanmar has seized and destroyed over 3,880 kilos of heroin,
24,800 kilos of opium, 11 million tablets of stimulants and burned
down 87 heroin refining camps in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
In the drug suppression endeavors, 766 members of the Myanmar
Armed Forces have lost their lives and 2,292 others sustained
severe injuries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The drug problem in Myanmar is a legacy of its colonial past
and it was further aggravated after independence with the drug
production and trafficking linked with the internal insurgency
problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been engaged in drug control activities in
cooperation with China and Thailand, and signed bilateral
agreements with India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Russia, Laos and the
Philippines in this area, the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the "moral imperative for the donor community to
play the role of staunch supporter of the efforts against illicit
narcotic crops".

JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's proposals for
a free trade protocol in the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) within the next eight years were unveiled before
Parliament's Trade and Industry Committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Director of African Trade Relations in Trade and
Industry Department, Mfundo Nkhulu, told the committee that the
proposed deal would see South Africa abolish almost 80 percent of
its import tariffs within five years, while its SADC trading
partners would phase down their own tariffs more slowly.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would cut most of its tariffs by a minimum of
five percent a year, the South African Press Association quoted
him as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nkhulu said that the trade offer would be placed before SADC
trade ministers at a meeting in Angola next month.
</P>
<P>
Only 10.1 percent of South Africa's total imports came from
other SADC countries, the bulk of which comprised mineral,
precious stones and metals.

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Saying he has told the truth
"over and over again," U.S. President Bill Clinton's friend Vernon
Jordan made his fifth appearance before grand jury on Tuesday in
the probe of an alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's help in getting former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky a lawyer and a job is a critical part of the criminal
investigation of whether Clinton or others suborned perjury in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against the president.
</P>
<P>
"When I came here... in early March, I said I helped Ms.
Lewinsky get a lawyer, I helped her get a job, I had assurances
that there was no sexual relationship (with Clinton) and I did not
tell her to lie. That was the truth then, and that is the truth
today," Jordan said outside the U.S. Courthouse after testifying.
</P>
<P>
He said Whitewater prosecutors told him that, "barring
unforeseen circumstances," this was his final grand jury
appearance.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Probe N.Irish Document Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The British government was
consulting the Northern Ireland police force on Tuesday about the
latest in a series of leaks from the Northern Ireland office.
</P>
<P>
The leak revealed that Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
contacted through telephone with a Dublin-based Sinn Fein member
who had been wanted by police for questioning for serious
guerrilla offense. It also revealed divisions between Britain and
Ireland over the composition of an advisory commission on the
province's policing.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such incident in three months, and Mowlam
said "every effort would be made to discover who leaked the
document" to the media.
</P>
<P>
Irish nationalist politicians feared the document, which was
quoted in media reports, was the work of a civil servant opposed
to the peace deal hammered out by rival groups in April.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said the peace deal
remained in good shape despite the leak.
</P>
<P>
"It would appear certainly that the leaker or leakers are
opposed to the peace process. They should really examine their
consciences... whoever they are," he was quoted by BBC as saying
in Dublin, the Irish capital.
</P>
<P>
"Sneaky little people in the Northern Ireland Office are not
going to obstruct us in the pursuit of what we all seek to achieve
- a permanent peace on the island of Ireland."
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the
Irish Republican Army, said the Northern Ireland civil service
needed to be "shaken up".
</P>
<P>
The leak showed that "the people who have run this place for
over 25 years are resisting change," he said in a statement.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday approved a
45 million U.S. dollar loan for Ecuador's health services
modernization project.
</P>
<P>
This project will assist in expanding access to, and improve
the quality and efficiency of, ambulatory and hospital services,
particularly maternal and child health services.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to develop new decentralized health
care organization, financing, and managerial models in selected
provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, the project is expected to contribute to
the reduction of health disparities in project areas. This
improvement will be attained through improvements in health status
of the poor people who are at the highest risk of premature death,
disease, and disability, gauging progress in terms of declining
mortality in mothers, infants and children under five years old.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Economic Recovery Fragile: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) Tuesday warned that the economic growth in Africa over the
past few years was still not strong enough to reduce poverty in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency of investment to Africa must also be improved
in poverty alleviation, ADB President Omar Kabbaj stated at the
current summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
The average growth rate of near five percent achieved by
African countries in recent years is fragile and vulnerable to
the problems in Africa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the origin of Africa's economic problems and
a major factor for the fragility of its current recovery can be
traced to the continent's policy weakness, adverse economic
development (both domestic and foreign), and political
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, if Africa is to restore lasting stability,
reinforce growth and sustain confidence in the continent's
ability to take its rightful place in the world economy, it must
continue to take firm and consistent policy actions to address
the root causes of its problems and spur additional domestic and
foreign investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the multidimensional nature of these problems, no
one and single policy action or measure will be sufficient as a
solution, the ADB president said.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called for an overall framework within which to
address all these problems in tandem and stimulate investment.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Contribute to Poverty Reduction in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, june 9 (xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) pledged here Tuesday to continue to focus its interventions
on activities that contribute to poverty reduction in Africa in
the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
The bank will continue to direct its financial and technical
assistance to the regional member countries in areas such as
strengthening production capacity and promoting policy reforms,
said ADB President Omar Kabbaj.
</P>
<P>
The areas also cover facilitating economic cooperation and
regional integration and promoting private sector development and
investment, he told the current summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
According to him, up to 45 percent of the African population
now live in absolute poverty and seriously lag behind those in
other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Current estimate indicates that Africa needs to achieve a
sustained level of economic growth at about 8-10 percent a year
to arrest and reverse the spread of poverty.
</P>
<P>
For the effort to reduce poverty, Kabbaj said, one important
financial instrument that needs to be developed further is that
of micro-finance for the poor.
</P>
<P>
With a view to contributing to such an effort, ADB is to
launch a pilot program which aims at increasing access to credit
and financial services for micro-entrepreneurs from Africa,
especially women.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, an amount of 20 million U.S.
Dollars of concessional resources has been earmarked to support
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
The bank also gives high priority to the central role of the
private sector in respect of attaining sustainable economic
growth in the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
To support the development of the private sector, ADB created
a full-fledged department within it last year and adopted a new
strategy which would allow the bank to offer a wide range of
services to its member countries.
</P>
<P>
Since it started its private sector operations in 1991, the
bank has approved 33 private sector projects consisting of loans
and equity participations totaling nearly 130 million U.S.
Dollars, Kabbaj disclosed.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Volume Shows Slower Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade volume
increased from January to May, but the growth momentum was
sluggish.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from Customs, the total
value of imports and exports in the first five months of this year
reached 123.69 billion U.S. dollars, a rise of 5.4 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports reached 71.11 billion U.S. dollars,
increasing by 8.6 percent; while the value of imports reached
52.58 billion U.S. dollars, growing by 1.5 percent. China's trade
surplus was 18.53 billion U.S. dollars, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The volume of exports gradually declined after February. The
value of export and import declined by 1.5 percent and 3.8 percent
respectively in May if being compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to customs analysis, Asia financial crisis has
gradually begun to affect China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign-oriented enterprises in the country tried to
expand their business in Africa and Latin America. The United
States replaced the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to
become the second largest trade partner of China.

<HEADLINE> Annan, Hasina Offer to Mediate Between India, Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wednesday
offered to play a mediating role in improving the hostile
relationship between Pakistan and India, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Hasina made the offer in their separate telephone
talk with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday,
according to officials from the Prime Minister's House.
</P>
<P>
Annan told Sharif that he is sending his special envoy shortly
to both India and Pakistan for talks on all the contentious issues
including Kashmir between the two South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He said his envoy's visit is to pave the way for his own tour
of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
While expressing gratitude to the U.N. Secretary General,
Sharif said the U.N. can play a very positive role in solving the
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
He requested Annan to increase international pressure on India
and help get the U.N. resolutions on Kashmir implemented.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh prime minister Hasina informed Sharif of her call
that she is willing to undertake a visit to Pakistan and to play a
role in solving the disputes including Kashmir between Pakistan
and India.
</P>
<P>
She said South Asia is very poor and the region cannot afford a
nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
Sharif welcomed her offer and assured his full cooperation in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that India's provocative nuclear tests had
totally altered the strategic balance in the region and Pakistan
had to correct the imbalance by detonating its own nuclear
devices.

<HEADLINE> Transition Date Remains Valid: Nigerian Senior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The October 1 date for the military
government to handover to an elected civilian one remains valid,
a member of Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), the
country's highest ruling body, has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Tuesday in Abuja after a joint meeting
of the PRC and the Council of States, Air-Vice-Marshal Mohammed
Alfa said the meeting had discussed the transition to civil rule
program announced by late head of state, General Sani Abacha in
October 1995.
</P>
<P>
"One thing we made categorically clear is that the (new)
administration is going to abide by the October 1 handing over
date," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alfa said," We have also resolved to carry on with those
aspects of the policies of the late head of state, particularly
as regards the transition program so that it will succeed."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the August 1 date for presidential and state governor
elections will remain unchanged, he said, "That is still under
discussion. It is something I will not comment on now."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's new leader, General Abdulsalam Abubakar said Tuesday
night that his government will continue to implement the
transition program, but he did not say if the October 1 date
still remains.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's five political parties registered under Abacha's
transition program adopted the late general as their consensus
presidential candidate in April.
</P>
<P>
With less than two months to the election now without any
candidate, there have been wide concern if the transition program
will be adhered to by the new government.

<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The former vice-president of the
Bank of Communications (BOC), Lu Jiashan, 63, was sentenced to
three years in jail, with three year' reprieve by the Intermediate
People's Court of Shanghai Municipality for taking 90,800 yuan in
bribes.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Supreme People's Court available
today, Lu took 54,000 yuan in bribes from the manager of a
vegetable oil factory based in Wujiang, a city in east China's
Jiangsu Province, while acting as the vice-president of the BOC
Shanghai branch and president of BOC in May of 1990 through
November of 1992,.
</P>
<P>
Lu then opened an account for the factory at the BOC Shanghai
branch and helped the manager to borrow from BOC's sub-branch in
Wujiang.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while as the vice-president of BOC in December of
1994, Lu accepted 36,800 yuan worth of gifts from the general
manager of a Shanghai-based investment company and then helped the
company to obtain loans from the BOC Pudong branch based in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Because Lu surrendered to the judicial department and returned
the bribes, the court made a lenient verdict which Lu did not
appeal to a higher court.

MOSCOW, June 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 people committed
suicide in the Russian Army and Navy in the first four months of
this year, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or the lower house of parliament, expressed grave
concern in a resolution over the alarming rate of suicides in
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, "Months-long wage delays, the
impossibility to provide the members of officers' families with
jobs, and constant housing difficulties -- all these problems
increase moral and psychological strain significantly and are a
powerful push to commit suicide."
</P>
<P>
Besides the large number of suicides, the Duma also called
attention to the overall high death rate in the Army and Navy in
the past 28 months, which totaled over 2,500.
</P>
<P>
The Duma resolution also warned of poor combat readiness
as a result of dwindling funding for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The Army and the Navy have virtually ceased to do combat
training, and the amount of damaged equipment is increasing,
which poses a certain threat to national security," the document
said.

<HEADLINE> Reformed State Enterprises Warned of Debt Responsibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's highest governing body,
the State Council, has issued a circular prohibiting state-owned
and collective enterprises from shirking their debts as their
operating mechanism is reformed.
</P>
<P>
The circular states that the evasion of debts by some
medium-sized and small state-owned and collective enterprises has
seriously undermined credit relations, resulting in nominal
creditor's rights in financial institutions and the loss of state
assets.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are urged to proceed from overall national
interests and intensify the guidance and supervision on the
shifting of operating mechanisms in such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As long as there is not a proper overseer of the debts,
relevant government units cannot approve reforms in the
enterprises or give new business licenses to them. The reformed
enterprises which have evaded debts must once again establish a
correct creditor-debtor relationship, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, financial institutions should take an active
part in supervising asset assessments in the enterprises which
undergo reform. And the institutions should regularly report
matters concerning creditor's rights to the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the enterprises must go through strict assessment
of their assets, and the outcome of that assessment must be
confirmed by the government departments in charge of the
management of state assets.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China and its local branches should also
work together with local governments to take effective measures to
supervise the situation of the creditor's rights, the circular
says.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Montreal Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and at least
15 others injured in a gas explosion which occurred Tuesday at a
soup kitchen for the homeless in Montreal, reports said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier report said that five people were severely injured and
about 25 others had minor injuries when the blast ripped the front
off the three-story building in Montreal's historic old port.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas leak was caused by a private subcontractor, who
accidentally sawed through a gas line as he was cutting through a
wall at the front of the building to change the gas meter.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighting officials said the explosion was probably set off
by an electrical spark.
</P>
<P>
By late Tuesday, searchers had accounted for all except one of
the center's workers, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said a worst catastrophe was narrowly averted, since
hundreds of homeless who visit the building for a lunchtime meal
had drifted off before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Almost all those injured were employees and volunteers of the
soup kitchen, most of them elderly, they added.

<HEADLINE> 6 Foreign Demonstrators Arrested in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Six foreign demonstrators were
arrested on Wednesday in Silwan Village near the Old City of East
Jerusalem in confrontations with Jewish settlers and police.
</P>
<P>
The arrests occurred when about 100 foreign, Palestinian and
Israeli human rights activists held a peaceful demonstration
outside two of the 13 Palestinian houses in Silwan which had been
seized by Israeli settlers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, from over 30 countries including the United
States, Canada, Britain and Sweden, expressed their outrage at the
seizure of Palestinan homes by the Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators are attending a four-day conference in East
Jerusalem on human rights issues of Israel and the Palestinian
territories. The conference was organized by the International
Committee on the Middle East, a mass organization supporting the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Four Americans, a French national and a Canadian were arrested
when the demonstration was broken up by Israeli police and
security forces.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held slogans condemning Israel's human
rights record and urging Israel to observe the 50-year-old
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
When the demonstrators walked down the road leading to another
house which had been seized by the same group of Jewish settlers,
they were met by armed settlers and police, who beat and dragged
away the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Several other demonstrators were also injured and one has
been sent to hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was formerly scheduled to be held in front of
the Israeli Interior Ministry, but the place was changed as the
demonstrators wanted to show their sympathy to the Palestinians
whose houses were seized by Jewish settlers.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Industry Should Consolidate, TRW President Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile industry has
yet to form several large companies to increase its
competitiveness, said Peter Hellman, president and chief operating
officer of TRW, North America's largest automotive supplier.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua during a visit here, Hellman
said that China has too many small automobile manufacturers
that are unable to cut costs and improve efficiency in an
effective way.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 120 automotive manufacturers and more
than 600 refitting factories. The total automobile output of the
country was only 1.5 million in 1997, less than that of a single
car plant in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Chinese and foreign investors spent 58
billion yuan on these automobile manufacturers. However, these
enterprises have yet to meet the demands of the domestic market in
terms of product development, technology, performance, quality and
product structure.
</P>
<P>
Hellman said that the automotive industry is undergoing a
global trend toward mergers. Since the world automotive industry
has a redundant capacity of over 18 million automobiles, only the
largest companies can make the most efficient use of resources and
survive intense competition.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler formed a
130-billion-U.S.-dollar automotive company, the third largest in
the world. Competition has intensified among automotive giants
from the United States, Europe and Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hellman said that it has been proved that scale is the key
factor for the efficiency of automotive companies.
</P>
<P>
TRW is the fourth largest automotive supplier in the world,
with annual sales of 12 billion U.S. dollars. It has production
and service companies in 23 countries and regions around the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that, at present, every newly produced car in the world
has 150 U.S. dollars worth of components and parts from TRW. As an
independent supplier, it will schedule production according to the
total demands of the world market. Therefore, the company's
efficiency will not be affected by changes in any single customer
or any specific market, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, he pointed out that almost all Chinese automotive
manufacturers run their own specific component suppliers. They
could not achieve the economic efficiency that large
companies have, he said.
</P>
<P>
TRW is ready to help China's automotive industry form its own
independent, large component suppliers, a move that Hellman
said will be mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
TRW has already set up four joint venture plants in China.
</P>
<P>
Hellman said that if TRW reached its global average sales level
in China, the company would have an annual revenue of 22 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said China's automotive industry should accelerate its pace
of integration.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already formulated the strategy of
forming five major automotive groups, each of them having an annual
capacity of 200,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Automotive Industry Group, Changchun No.1 Automotive
Group, Dongfeng automotive Company, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive
Company and Tianjin Automotive Company have become the forerunners
in the process of integration.
</P>
<P>
The top 14 Chinese automotive companies account for more than
90 percent of the country's total output. Each of them has an
annual production capacity larger than 10,000 automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Hellman said that Chinese companies should focus resources on
certain specific products to attain market advantages.
</P>
<P>
He said that TRW is a leading producer of occupant restraint
systems and steering wheels, steering and suspension systems,
engine components, safety, security and convenience electronics,
engineered fasteners and fastening systems in the world. These TRW
products occupy 30 to 40 percent of the world market. TRW accounts
for around 17 percent of the world automotive component market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the global wave of mergers in the automotive
industry will affect China sooner or later. Some of TRW's major
customers such as GM, Chrysler, Volkswagen and Ford have already
entered the China market.
</P>
<P>
Hellman said he hopes that Chinese automotive companies will be
prepared for the pending challenge of international competition.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Killed Near Jewish Settlement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian was shot dead by
Israeli soldiers near a Jewish settlement in Gaza Strip on Tuesday
night, Israel Radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement of Israeli Army as saying that
the soldiers opened fire after they found a number of Palestinians
trying to enter the Jewish settlement Morag and killed one of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an explosive device was found near the settlement
and the army suspected that it would be used in a terror attack
against Israeli settlers or soldiers, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Police Commander Khaled Abu Oleh was quoted as
saying that the dead Palestinian had been taken to a hospital in
a Palestinian refugee camp about 15 kilometers south of Morag.
</P>
<P>
Oleh noted that the Palestinian and Israeli police were
carrying out a joint investigation over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Israel has handed over most of the Gaza Strip to the
Palestinian National Authority and kept control over the areas
around a number of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a number of Palestinians were killed near Jewish
settlements in Gaza when they marked the establishment of the
Jewish state 50 years as a "catastrophe" and clashed with Israeli
troops guarding the settlements.

<HEADLINE> EU Raises Set-Aside Rate for 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, decided on Wednesday to
raise the obligatory set-aside rate for the 1999-2000 marketing
year to ensure market balance.
</P>
<P>
The set-aside rate for arable land was raised five percentage
points to 10 percent for the designated period.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the decision unanimously after taking into
account the market outlook in the short term and the conclusion
that there is a serious danger of intervention stocks for
cereals increasing again to unacceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the set-aside rate will increase the area set aside
(compulsory and voluntary) by 1.5 million hectares and to reduce
production by 8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, European commissioner in charge of agriculture,
said: "Set-aside is a market management instrument whose level
must be adjusted in either direction to ensure market balance and
stability."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner estimated that without raising the set-aside
rate, the European Union could have 30 million tons in
intervention by the end of the 1999-2000 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
Producers of certain crops in the European Union countries can
benefit from a per-hectare compensatory payment provided they
withdraw a certain percentage of land from production for which
they receive a payment of 68.83 ECU per ton of crops.
</P>
<P>
Producers may also set aside land on a voluntary basis. In
fact, 50 percent of the 4 million hectares set aside for the
1997-1998 marketing year was done so.

<HEADLINE> World Military Expenditures Decline, Says 1998 Yearbook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- World military expenditures
declined by about one-third over the decade of 1988-1997 and is
estimated to correspond to about 740 billion U.S.dollars in 1997,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute's (SIPRI) yearbook 1998.
</P>
<P>
The SIPRI yearbook said the decline in military spending and
armaments slowed down in the past two years to an average rate of
less than 1 percent as against an average of 4.5 percent over the
entire period.
</P>
<P>
The biggest cut over the decade was made by Russia. Its
military expenditure in 1997 was less than one-tenth of that of
the former Soviet Union in 1988. There have also been significant
cuts in Africa, Central America and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In 1988-1997, military expenditures increased in some regions,
in particular in the Middle East and South and East Asia, said the
yearbook. However, the military budgets of several countries in
East Asia are being revised downwards as a result of the financial
crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the military research and development budget, the
1998 SIPRI yearbook said the United States remains the dominant
power in terms of military technology, with a budget of more than
seven times that of France. Russia's military technology is coming
under stricter export controls and continues to fall further
behind.
</P>
<P>
India has spent about 500 million dollars (in 1995 dollars)
annually on military research and development since 1993. This is
about 28 percent of Indian government funding of science and 18
percent of funding for science in the entire country, a figure
exceeded only in the U.S. If funding for nuclear and space
research and development is included, the amount is 910 million
dollars, or 68 percent of the Indian government funding for
science.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the transfers of major conventional weapons, the
yearbook said that international transfers of major conventional
weapons in 1997 were just over 25 billion dollars. The U.S. share
in deliveries of these weapons increased to 43 percent, while that
of Russia had fallen to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The yearbook said that of the 25 major armed conflicts in 1997,
only one -- between India and Pakistan -- was interstate. All the
others were internal conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Declares Strike Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) on
Wednesday announced that the crippling strike by its 620-strong
pilots union was over and the airlines has begun to hire new
pilots to replace the striking pilots.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, PAL management said a downsized airlines is
emerging from the five-day illegal walkout of members of the
Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines (ALPAP).
</P>
<P>
The PAL management said the striking pilots reaffirmed the loss
of their employment status with PAL by defying the government's
return-to-work order whose deadline lapsed late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The airlines is now hiring permanent replacements of these
pilots which the PAL management already declared as having lost
their job Monday, it said.
</P>
<P>
But there was no comment from the pilots union, which launched
the strike last Friday to protest an early retirement policy
contained in a collective bargaining agreement signed earlier by
the PAL and the union.
</P>
<P>
The strike has almost paralyzed all flight operations of the
country's flag carrier, stranding thousands of passengers at
Manila and provincial airports.
</P>
<P>
With a handful of pilots left in its roster, PAL will now have
a limited international network and an expanded domestic service,
the PAL management said.
</P>
<P>
As new pilot recruits come in, PAL's level of operations will
increase accordingly.
</P>
<P>
During the strike, PAL operated only 20 percent of its
scheduled flights due to a shortage of qualified pilots and the
strict regulatory requirements of aviation authorities.
</P>
<P>
To improve its cash-flow position, the PAL management said it
will sell or lease several of its 54 aircraft, including those
newly acquired from Airbus and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The strike cost the airline about 150 million pesos (3.8
million U.S. dollars) a day in lost revenues or almost 1 billion
pesos (25.6 million dollars) since the work stoppage began last
Friday.

<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The top leader of China's trade
unions today urged all local workers' organizations to guarantee
the basic living standards of laid-off workers and vigorously
carry out the re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
All the trade union organizations across China should listen
to common workers, especially those who have been laid-off, to
hear their views and solve problems for them, Wei Jianxing,
chairman of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU), said at the 19th presidium meeting of the
12th ACFTU Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wei called on the federation and all trade unions to stabilize
China's working class as the country deepens the reform. Leaders
of local trade unions must care for the daily life of the workers
and properly deal with problems among them.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions must firmly make economic development their
central task while safeguarding the legitimate rights and
interests of workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, the workers' activity and creativity
should be encouraged and protected by grass-roots trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the three-day meeting also discussed the work
report of the 13th national congress of the ACFTU.
</P>
<P>
The work of the federation should be guided by Deng Xiaoping
Theory and the guidelines of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), said Wei, also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The second plenum of the 12th ACFTU Executive Committee defined
the overall principle of the federation. The federation vowed to
seek truth from facts and boldly blaze new trails under the
guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Wei also encouraged workers to participate in and supervise the
work of the trade unions.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hopes for Early Signing of Loan Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is moving
for an early conclusive and signing of its 22nd yen loan package
with the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan,
Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who arrived here Tuesday from Tokyo, expressed
confidence that the loan package involving 900 million U.S.
dollars could be wrapped up shortly.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said there is a need to fast-track the loan signing to
preempt possible problems with the scheduled merger of the OECF
and the Japanese Export-Import Bank on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines fears that the merger of the OECF, Japan's
official lending arm, with Jexim Bank could complicate the process
of handling the loan.
</P>
<P>
In his earlier report to President Fidel Ramos, Siazon said it
would be highly desirable if the loan package could be wrapped up
before the OECF-Jexim Bank merger since the OECF will wield lesser
power and influence after the merger.
</P>
<P>
Jexim Bank is also a state-owned financial institution and
likewise provides development-oriented loans, but unlike the OECF
which normally does not give concessional terms.
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 projects to be financed from the 22nd yen loan
package are a power distribution infrastructure system and a
quality air project for Metro Manila, Siazon said.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Lifting Ban on British Beef Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, proposed on Wednesday to
relax the ban on British beef exports under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, European commissioner in charge of agricultural
affairs, said the commission unanimously agreed to establish the
rules for a partial lifting of the ban on exports under a
date-based export scheme.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will allow the export of deboned fresh meat and
products from eligible cattle born after August 1, 1996, the date
at which time the meat and bone meal ban was in place and properly
enforced.
</P>
<P>
"The cattle must be older than six months but younger than 30
months," said the commissioner. He explained that the six-month
limit provides traceability for parent animals.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions include specially-designated slaughter houses
to process the meat and a computerized data base on cattle being
used to provide export beef.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposal needs an approval with a qualified
majority in the commission's standing veterinary committee, and the
European council of ministers has to be called upon to examine the
proposal if it fails to get the qualified majority approval in the
veterinary committee.
</P>
<P>
The ministers council can approve the proposal with a qualified
majority or reject it on a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
Britain first proposed lifting the ban on beef exports last
October. The ban was enforced in 1996 following Britain's
announcement of a possible link between the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy and the human variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has already approved the lifting of
bans on the export of Northern Irish beef and beef products under
the same conditions.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, at the peak of the BSE epidemic, which was first
spotted in 1986 in Britain, a total of 37,280 BSE cases were
confirmed, whereas last year a substantially-reduced number of
3,396 BSE cases were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Over 3 million cattle have been slaughtered and destroyed under
various disease eradication programs.

<HEADLINE> Chief of Chinese PLA General Staff Meets Peruvian Military Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), met with
Nicolas Hermoza, president of joint command of the armed forces
and commanding general of the army of Peru, and his party here
today.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of China's Central Military Commission,
appreciated the Peruvian government's "one China" policy and its
support to China on human rights, as well as Hermoza's positive
efforts in the past to develop the friendship and cooperation
between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Fu said he believed that Hermoza's current visit to China will
increase mutual understanding and friendship between the two armed
forces, and the growth of the friendly relations between the two
countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Chinese government values its relations with
Peru, Fu said the relations between the two armed forces have
grown rapidly along with the growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the PLA have adopted a positive
attitude toward the future exchanges and cooperation at different
levels and in various aspects between the two armed forces and are
willing to make active efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
Fu also briefed the visitors on China's defense policy and
military construction.
</P>
<P>
Hermoza expressed his satisfaction with the growth of relations
between the two armed forces in the past few years, saying that he
will make more effort to further develop relations between the two
armed forces and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hermoza arrived here today as guest of Fu, who presided over a
welcoming ceremony for Hermoza this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> China's Air Force Performs Plateau Aerial Rescue Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Air Force has
successfully conducted an aerial rescue test on the
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau recently.
</P>
<P>
The test, the first by the Chinese air force on plateaus,
shows that the air force is capable of conducting aerial
rescue operations on plateaus, a senior officer said.
</P>
<P>
The aerial rescue operation includes the self-rescue and
survival of pilots and the rescue operation after pilots
parachuting.
</P>
<P>
As a result, aerial rescue capability is of great importance to
the maintenance of the air force's combat effectiveness and to
civil aviation, rescue operations in disasters and field
explorations.
</P>
<P>
The senior officer said that the test, aiming to examine the
quality of rescue facilities developed by the Chinese air force,
shows that the facilities could help pilots survive three days
after parachuting, making it possible for pilots to wait for the
arrival of rescuers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese air force has made successful
rescue tests in jungles, deserts, frigid zones and on the sea.

<HEADLINE> Audi Promoting Luxury Cars in China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Audi AG will invest
several million U.S. dollars to build its image as a luxury
carmarker in China's market and expects to become the first
manufacturer in China to produce luxury cars, according to Erich
Schmitt, a member of Audi's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help reach that goal, the company will display
its full range of vehicles -- including the old-style
"Hillclimber," best-selling A4, A6 and A8, as well as the
"Allroad" concept car -- at the 5th Beijing International
Automotive Industry Exposition scheduled for June 23-30 in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
In the past, few Audi luxury cars were sold in China. As a
result, Audi is only seen in China as a high-quality sedan, but
not as a luxury car. In western countries, Audi has a bigger share
of the luxury car market.
</P>
<P>
To further enhance the company's presence in China, Audi plans
to produce its luxury A6 car early next century.
</P>
<P>
The sale of Audi's series of cars exceeded 6,000 last year in
China and 546,000 worldwide. The company's output value for 1997
was 22 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
China's First Automotive Works (FAW) based in Changchun,
capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, installed assembly
lines of Audi cars in 1990. In 1996 the first batch of Audi 200 V6
cars were produced by the FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, a
joint effort of FAW, Volkswagen and Audi. Audi has exported cars
to China since 1994.

<HEADLINE> 225 Rebels Killed, 564 Injured in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 225 Tamil rebels were
killed and 564 others injured in fierce fighting between
government troops and Tamil rebels in the past 10 days in Northern
Province of Sri Lanka, according to a senior official Wednesday,
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting between government troops and Tamil rebels
killed at least 433 persons on both sides and wounded more than
2,100, Sri Lankan Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte
Wednesday told parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops suffered 208 killed and 1,536 others
injured, 212 of them seriously, in fighting during the 10-day
period ending Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two government officers and 63 soldiers were missing following
the battles, but some of them have returned to their units, said
Ratwatte, who is also Minister of Irrigation and power.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the official gave details of the
latest military operations in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government imposed censorship on local and
foreign correspondents on the battles in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
A censorship was necessary because local newspapers had
published details of military plans allowing Tamil rebels advance
information of the military operations, the minister told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting took place after the troops resumed their
advance on June 3 to recapture the strategic Mankulam town on its
way to clear a 75-km supply route between the South and North.

MADRID, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The 15-member European Union and

economic links among their medium-size and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The 50 million U.S. dollar five-year plan unveiled Wednesday by
the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, will help
medium-size and small businesses deepen mutual understanding and

</P>
<P>
The Asian countries joining in the program are China,
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, India,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, the
Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Pak, French Officials Hold Talks on South Asian Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of senior officials
from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs held consultations
here today with their Pakistani counterparts on the current
situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Siddique Khan Kanju, Pakistani Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs, told the guests that Pakistan's nuclear tests were
conducted for self-defense and aimed at restoring the strategic
balance in South Asia following India's decision to weaponize and
to induct nuclear weapons, according to a press release issued by
the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that Pakistan shared the international
community's concern for nuclear non-proliferation, the minister
contended that Pakistan's legitimate security concerns must be
recognized.
</P>
<P>
He urged the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to
take concerted action for resolution of the core issue of Kashmir
in accordance with the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The minister made it clear to the French guests that given
India's tendency to renege on its commitments as shown during the
past 50 years, bilateral dialogue between Pakistan and India will
not serve any useful purpose.
</P>
<P>
He said that the success of the India-Pakistan dialogue can
only be assured by participation of the international community or
a third party mediation.
</P>
<P>
The French delegation, who arrived here from New Delhi Tuesday,
emphasized the need for non-proliferation and de-escalation of
tension in the South Asia region. The delegation also delivered a
letter to the Pakistani Prime Minster from the French President.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Majlis Deputies Call for Impeachment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one Iranian conservative
Majlis (Parliament) deputies Wednesday called for the impeachment
of Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the
conservative parliament members said that the "continuation of
Nouri's service in the post as interior minister is detrimental to
tranquillity and stability in the country."
</P>
<P>
They accused the minister of creating tensions in society by
making provocative speeches in different provinces and appointing
inexperienced people to managerial posts in the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
The proposed motion against Nouri was believed to be another
step launched by the conservatives against the government of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, after Karbaschi, Khatami's
another strong supporter, was put on trial on corrupt charges.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives opened the trial on Karbaschi on Sunday and
the moderates believed that he would be convicted by the
conservative judiciary though he has denied all the charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
According to the Majlis regulations, Nouri should give his
explanation before the Majlis within 10 days after the proposed
motion for the impeachment was submitted.
</P>
<P>
"By impeaching the interior minister, the right wing in the
Majlis can no more claim to be supporting Khatami's government,"
the Iran News daily on Monday quoted a moderate parliamentarian as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that political struggles between the
two rival factions have entered a sensitive stage as both sides
openly blast at each other and some conservatives even fingered at
Khatami and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani.

BRUSSELS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization will increase its visibility along borders between
the Serbian province of Kosovo and Albania and Macedonia to
demonstrate its determination to stop the violence there, a NATO
official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is ready to rise to the challenge by putting our military
assets at the disposal of international diplomacy," said the
official who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers are meeting on Thursday and Friday to

deployment of allied forces in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers are expected to authorize "immediate
initiatives" that the official described as new military exercises
to be held in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
NATO has planned an air-land exercise in Albania in late August
and another exercise in Macedonia in September.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance is believed to be considering the
option of threatening air strikes and a no-fly zone to persuade
Yugoslavia to withdraw troops and special police from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The same official said that all NATO member states will push
hard to obtain an appropriate resolution at the United Nations
Security Council which could authorize the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Russia, however, is opposed to the use of force in resolving
the crisis of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Abiola's Family Mourns Abacha's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The family of Basorun M.K. Abiola,
the alleged winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential
election who is now in detention, have expressed their sadness
over the death of Nigeria's late head of state, General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
In a two-page statement issued Tuesday by Abiola's wife,
Mariam, on behalf of the entire family, they also appealed to the
new leader, General Abdusalam Abubakar to take a serious look at
the June 12 issue and immediately free all political detainees
including M.K. Abiola, for a genuine and convincing national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Abiola's wife said, she wish to, on behalf of family, "condole
our beloved country and particularly the Abacha family on the
sudden and chocking demise of General Sani Abacha."
</P>
<P>
She said,"Though in detention for the past four
years, I have do doubt that Basorun Abiola will mourn the death
of the former leader."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Abacha's death on June 8 falls exactly
at the mid-point of the assassination of Abiola's late wife
Kudirat on June 4, 1996 and the June 12 election.
</P>
<P>
The fact, the statement said, is very symbolic and should
serve as the indicator of God's supremacy over man.
</P>
<P>
The family said, "Time has come for the nation to truly move
forward and the only plausible avenue is the free participation
of all Nigerians especially those who are presently detained for
standing by the truth."
</P>
<P>
They implored General Abubakar, "a very modest, urbane and
humane gentleman, to hearken to the voice of reason," saying that
posterity will favor him accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The statement ended with the pray that the Almighty Allah will
grant the Abacha family the fortitude to bear the "irreparable
loss".
</P>
<P>
M.K. Abiola, a billionaire from southwestern Nigeria, was
arrested by the Abacha government on June 24, 1994 in Lagos,
after he declared himself the president of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
His supporters have called for the recognition of the 1993
election after Abacha's death.
</P>
<P>
The new leader, Abubakar said Tuesday night that his
government will adhere to Abacha's transition program, by which
the military is expected to give power to an elected civilian
government on October 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Soybean Program to Provide More Protein to Chinese Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A nutrition program, the
National Soybean Action Plan, will be carried out nationwide to
improve physical conditions of the Chinese youngsters.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural official said today at a work conference that
tens of millions of people living in rural China lack
sufficient food and clothing, and children in some areas are
suffering from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
A national survey shows that the amount of protein taken in by
rural children aged 6-12 is lower than that of their
urban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Partially because of this, the average height and weight of
rural children are also lower than that of children in cities,
the survey claims.
</P>
<P>
Related departments initiated the program in 1996 to spread the
use of soybean-enriched food in hundreds of selected schools in
China's economically backward areas, a nutritionist said.
</P>
<P>
The results proved that foodstuffs made from soybeans have
improved the nutrition of the youngsters, he said, and their
height and weight increased.
</P>
<P>
Eating soybean food is a cheap and effective way to get
enough protein from daily meals, the expert said. "Urban children

<HEADLINE> Philippine Public Deplores Pilots' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Various sectors in the Philippines
are deploring the defiance by Philippine Airlines (PAL) pilots of
a government return-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
The pilots belonging to the 620-strong Airline Pilots
Association of the Philippines (ALPAP) staged an allegedly illegal
strike last Friday, which had crippled flight operations of the
country's flag carrier, stranding thousands of passengers at the
Manila and provincial airports.
</P>
<P>
The striking ALPAP members, who were declared by PAL management
as having lost their employment status with PAL, were asked
Saturday by the Department of Labor and Employment to return to
work.
</P>
<P>
But the pilots, who said they were protesting a new retirement
policy, defied the order which lapsed late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This has prompted PAL management to ask the Labor Department to
allow them to hire new pilots to be able to resume operations,
saying that the striking pilots have reaffirmed the loss of their
employment status with PAL.
</P>
<P>
Because of the work stoppage, mobility of people and goods from
various points of the archipelago country was affected, resulting
in huge losses in business and opportunity, the Philippine News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
With the strike on its fifth day now, businessmen complained of
substantial losses amounting to several millions of pesos.
</P>
<P>
In central Cebu city, business and civic groups said the strike
is seriously affecting the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Val Satira, a Cebu businessman, said that the country, due to
the volatility of the economic situation, cannot afford a costly
strike that can only lead to the "closure of a pioneer airline
company, Philippine Airlines, the nation's flag carrier."
</P>
<P>
Another businessman, Rene Jose, warned that all the investments
for the celebration of the centennial of the Philippines'
independence will be lost if people who want to come and
participate are prevented by the PAL pilots' strike.

<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine soldiers uprooted
Wednesday about 1,000 fully grown marijuana plants in a secluded
farm in a remote village in the southern Philippine province of

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Flat Steel Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- To adjust the product structure of
its iron and steel industry, China is now working to increase its
steel plate production.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Wang Xiaoqi, deputy director of the
development planning department of China's State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry, while speaking at the ongoing
China Iron and Steel Conference 1998 here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China will start steel projects that are aimed at
creating production capacity of key plate products in such steel
makers as the Baoshan, Anshan and Capital iron and steel groups.
</P>
<P>
He said these projects include hot and cold continuous casting
mills as well as zinc-plating production lines.
</P>
<P>
The construction of cold roll mills is expected to begin early
next century in the Wuhan, Capital and Taiyuan iron and steel
plants.
</P>
<P>
China is also accelerating the upgrading of existing plate
lines, including the hot continuous casting lines in Anshan,
Benxi, Taiyuan, Panzhihua and Meishan, and the cold continuous
casting line in Wuhan Iron and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
China's industrialization will result in changes in steel
consumption restructure, which is evident in the increasing share
of steel plates and pipes in the total consumption.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chinese steel consumers are calling for
cost-efficient plate products to substitute for imports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show two-thirds of China's steel imports are
plates, of which many cannot be produced in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the state administration will give full
support to high value-added and technology-intensive plates such
as auto sheet, appliance and package sheet, cold rolled silicon
plates.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Continues Tight Monetary Policies to Curb Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
will continue its tight monetary policies to curb inflationary
pressure, a central bank official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Diwa Gunigundo, director for research of the bank, said that
monetary aggregates are still well in check and the bank will try
its best to meet reserve money ceilings.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total amount of reserve money, which is
defined as cash in circulation plus reserve deposits of banks with
the central bank, is about 20 million pesos (0.5 million U.S.
dollars) below the ceiling set by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
"Our monetary policies are appropriately tight and would remain
so to make sure that inflation won't increase too much," Gunigundo
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank is ready to respond with whatever
measures necessary if the monetary situation calls for it.
</P>
<P>
With a 9.2 percent inflation rate in May, market analysts
believe that monetary authorities in the country would have to
reverse its move to bring down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, upon appeals of the business sector, has been
trying to bring down lending rates to the 11 percent level before
the Asian financial crisis broke out last July.
</P>
<P>
The central bank appeared to be making headway with rates based
on the 91-day Treasury bill which is falling below 15 percent now.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that the central bank may have to tighten up
its monetary level with the increase of inflation rate in May and
the weakening of the peso against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine Dealing System Wednesday, the peso fell
further to 40.27 against the dollar following the latest round of
currency fluctuation in the region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Para-military Forces to Combat Armed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to deploy
para-military forces to Biharamulo district in the northwest
Kagera Region to deal with armed Burundian refugees who are
allegedly harassing local Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ameir Mohammed, the Minister of Home Affairs, has said
that his ministry is contacting the regional commissioner's
office to know the extent of the problem, The Guardian newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will dispatch the para-military force to conduct special
operations to comb the armed Burundian refugees who are
terrorizing our people in the Biharamulo district," he said
Tuesday in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, more than 450 Tanzanians living in
the district have fled their home after being harassed by armed
Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to Anatoli Choya, the Member of Parliament for
Biharamulo, the refugees have been terrorizing local residents,
especially by robbing their property.
</P>
<P>
The MP said last week many residents lost their property
and fled their houses for fear of being killed by armed Burundian
refugees who most of the time plunder whatever valuable
belongings they find.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have been unable to control the bandits who
come from the Msuhura refugee camp in the Ngara District on the
border with Burundi, said Choya, adding that the bandits, who
hide themselves well, are difficult to be spotted.
</P>
<P>
It is ridiculous that Tanzanians have fled their houses and
become refugees in their own country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The MP said the district will most probably face an acute
shortage of food this year as some 50 Tanzanian households have
abandoned their farms.
</P>
<P>
Those who fled their houses are currently accomodated at a
police station nearby and a house belonging to a Norwegian-aided
project, Choya said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania plays host to around 225,000 refugees, mainly Hutus
who fled Burundi's civil war, the United Nations High
Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Asks for Egypt's Help to End Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea Wednesday urged Egypt to
help it and its neighbor Ethiopia to reach a peaceful solution to
the border conflicts, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a message sent to Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak from his Eritrean counterpart Issayas Aferwerki in
the day by Eritrean Minister of Local Government Mohamud Sherifo,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Sherifo arrived in Cairo Tuesday night to brief Egyptian
officials on the latest developments of the armed clashes along
the border of the two Horn of Africa states.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Ever since
then, the two countries have been at odds over at least six border
areas. On May 6, fightings broke out between the two sides for a
400-square-kilometer rocky land.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president has sent messages to the leaders of the
two countries, calling for an immediate end to the armed conflicts
and holding peace talks to resolve the border row.
</P>
<P>
"Fighting solves no problems. Negotiations and nothing else
hold the key to the problems," Mubarak has said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, an Egyptian aircraft chartered by the
United States landed at Cairo airport early Wednesday, carrying
230 passengers of Egypt, the U.S., Eritrea and other countries
from Eritrean capital Asmara.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
President Scalfaro told Li that he is satisfied with the growth

both sides.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China values its ties with Italy and Sino-Italian
relations have witnessed a smooth growth in the past year with
frequent contacts between the leaders of the two countries and
active bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy, trade,
science, technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that exchanges between NPC and Italian
parliament have been reinforced along with the constant growth of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China and Italy should further
tighten exchanges and cooperation in cultural heritage, Li
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, Li said both China and Italy have ancient civilizations
and have made unique yet important contributions to human
civilization.
</P>
<P>
Rome and the Italian Renaissance have left a far-reaching
impact on world history, he said, adding that Chinese very much
appreciate the Italian people.
</P>
<P>
He said that every ancient country has a task of developing as
well as inheriting its tradition and civilization.
</P>
<P>
The reality is the extension of history, he said, noting that
if development started from historical nihilism and without
heritage, it would lose prerequisites and the foundation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It also would be difficult to keep the merits and features of
that civilization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the reality is a short period in the long run of
history. Without development and research on the combination with
the times, the traditional culture will lose its vitality and will
not be inherited, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should follow the development and change of history, apply
modern civilization, means and conditions, make an earnest
research on and sort out the best part of the civilization, and
make a new summary and elaboration to give it a full play," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, as Italy has many successful experiences in
inheriting and developing its national tradition and culture,
China should learn and draw from it.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro agreed with Li's viewpoints, saying both Italy and
China have ancient civilization and a rich cultural and historical
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
He said both people have done a good job in inheriting and
using these inheritance to serve the happiness of their people and
the future.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president said, it is very important for the two
nations to strengthen their cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said his country treasures its exchanges and
cooperation in other fields with China in a bid to keep a
continuous development of the relations between the two
countries.

</P>
<P>
Sagadawa, which falls on April 15 on the Tibetan calendar, is
the birth and nirvana day of the Buddha. Buddhists pray to

"Elder generations say it will disperse calamities by praying
on such a religiously auspicious day like today," she said. "I

life and health for my family."
</P>
<P>
Bargor Street was crowded with people offering prayers, monks
and peddlers.
</P>
<P>
The festival for Baima Yangtsong, manager of a sweet tea house,
means a golden business opportunity. She said today was the

said she could earn several hundred yuan today.
</P>
<P>
Each temple in Lhasa also attracted a large number of
pilgrims. The Johkang Temple in the downtown area opened two hours

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania in the United States plans to start a
management training program for high-ranking Chinese officials and
public servants in Beijing in September.
</P>
<P>
The training program is part of an agreement announced when
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the Wharton campus last fall.
</P>
<P>
The senior management training program is conducted at the
National School of Administration in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Scott Koerwer, director of Custom Programs for Wharton
Executive Education at the school, told local news media here
today that work on the other two training programs under the
agreement are also proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
One of the programs is the Jiangsu Management Development
Program in east China's Jiangsu Province. The other is the
Shanghai Executive Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Koerwer said that the Wharton School is ready to forge a
long-term relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
As President Bill Clinton prepares for his visit to China later
this month, faculty and administrators from the Wharton School
visited Beijing to develop specific plans for conducting these
programs.
</P>
<P>
Wharton is considered one of the leading business schools in
the world. It began educational exchanges with China in the
1940s. Since 1979, it has been increasing cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The training programs that it now conducts in China are aimed
at enhancing the management skills of government officials and
executives of state-owned enterprises who are working at the
national, regional and local levels.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of the public will have
a chance to appreciate the beauty and diversity of marine shells
by visiting Hong Kong's first Shell House which opened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the shape of a semi-opened shell and with an area of 180 sq
m, the house displays some 5,000 colorful and beautifully
sculptured shells from Hong Kong and other places, most of which
donated by a shell collector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Secretary for Planning,
Environment and Lands Bowen Leung said the exhibition, which
offers a systematic display on the features, ecological value,
classification and biological characteristics of shells, would
have a valuable educational impact for the many thousands of
visitors every year.
</P>
<P>
It "allows us to appreciate the importance of shells to the
living system in the sea. And most important, it helps us
understand that any damage that we do to the marine ecosystem
damages our own life support system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lueng noted that the government has recently taken a number of
steps to protect and conserve the aquatic communities.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the marine parks program, three
marine parks and a marine reserve have been designated while four
other sites are being examined.
</P>
<P>
All the marine waters of Hong Kong have been designed as water
quality control zones, and "we are investing heavily in sewage
collection and treatment facilities to improve water quality,"
said the official.

World Cup." said Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also described the preparation of the Nigerian
team:"We're preparing as best we can. The injuries to Kanu and
Amokachi are nothing more than minor hiccups. There are still two
other matches to be played. Above all, we've got to play together
and fight it out for the whole 90 minutes."
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic was not concerned his team's 5-1 defeat by the
Netherland in a warm-up match:"I believe in this Nigeria team. They
only lost 1-0 to Germany, who are one of the best three teams in the
world. We will go on dreaming of being world champions."

<HEADLINE> OAU Describes General Abacha as "True </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Wednesday said, "General Sani Abacha was a true
pan-Africanist who worked tirelessly for the dignity and security
of the entire continent of Africa."
</P>
<P>
"For years to come, the positive contribution that our late
brother made in ensuring the implementation of ECOWAS and OAU
decisions relating to the restoration of constitutional order and
the re-instatement of the legitimate government of President
Tejan Kabbah in Sierra Leone will be a shining testimony to his
pan-Africanism," said an OAU press release issued here.
</P>
<P>
The release serves as a memorial tribute to the death of
General Abacha, head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed
forces of Nigeria and Chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The press release said that Abacha's boldest initiative had
been the launching in Nigeria of the process of transition aimed
at restoring democratic government to the country.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha "will be remembered for the energy and
resources that he committed towards the restoration of stability
in the west African sub-region."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the OAU appealed to Nigeria's new head of state,
General Abdusalam Abubakar, the government and people of Nigeria
in this tragic and testing time to do all in their power to
maintain peace and security nationwide, strive to achieve
democracy as a nation, and also uphold the unity and integrity of
their great country.

<HEADLINE> Solid Fundamentals to Lead HK to Recovery: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong
official said here Wednesday that the sound economic fundamentals,
which may not provide an instant solution to the current economic
woes, would eventually help the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) ride out of the Asian financial storm.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Hui, SAR secretary for financial services, made the
remarks in a keynote speech at the Far Eastern Economic Review's
annual conference, with "Weathering the storm: Hong Kong and the
Asian financial crisis" as its theme.
</P>
<P>
"They (economic fundamentals) may not bring us immediate relief
and reversal of fortune, but I do believe that it's largely the
fundamentals that will eventually see us through our present
difficulties and lead us, once again, to recovery," Hui told the
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
He listed a string of Hong Kong's economic fundamentals, which
are the same before and after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong still holds its status as an international financial
center, keeps its currency stable, sticks to prudent fiscal
policy, has a sound and robust banking system, and serves as a
gateway to the mainland, according to the official, who stressed
that economic confidence was basically built upon sound and solid
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, Hong Kong economy recorded negative
growth, with GDP falling two percent from the same period of
1997. Unemployment rate hit a 14-year high, interest rates soared
to trigger credit crunch, while property and stock prices plunged.
</P>
<P>
"In times of turmoil, frustration and uncertainty, we have no
better alternative than to hold fast to those basic fundamentals
and policies that have withstood endless tests and strains in the
past," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hui warned: "The real danger, as always, lies in letting go of
those fundamentals in exchange for immediate, but ultimately
futile and illusory relief."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Department Store Builds Asia Headquarters in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese-funded department store
Jusco has established its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong to
strengthen its Asian operations.
</P>
<P>
Located at Jusco Hong Kong's head office in Quarry Bay, Hong
Kong Island, the new Asia headquarters, which commenced operations
on Wednesday, will enhance support to Jusco stores in Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Chinese mainland and Taiwan in areas of
product merchandising, new store development and human resources
management.
</P>
<P>
Akihito Tanaka, previously managing director of Jusco Hong
Kong, was appointed managing director of the headquarters
and vice chairman of Jusco Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The new set-up will further enhance the department store's
competitive edge in the Asian region, especially under the current
tough operating environment, Tanaka said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we expect the more streamlined communications
channels resulted from the new set-up could facilitate a faster
and more efficient decision making process, which is of great
importance to the business expansion plans of Jusco Hong Kong and
other Jusco operation in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jusco Hong Kong plans to build a network of 10 chain stores by
the year 2000. Currently it operates six general merchandise
stores in the city, selling a wide range of daily necessity
products. Two more stores are scheduled for opening later this
year.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Increases 98/99 Budget to $91.6 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar Revolutionary
Government has announced to spend 60.375 billion Shillings (about
91.6 million U.S. Dollars) in the 1998/99 fiscal year, an
increase of 8.9 percent over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the government budget proposals for the 1998/99
fiscal year to the House of Representatives Tuesday, Minister of
Finance Amina Saalum Ali said that about 42 billion Shillings (63.8
million U.S. Dollars) will be for recurrent expenditure while
some 17 billion Shillings (about 25.8 million Dollars) for
development.
</P>
<P>
Ali said the government will concentrate on achieving a 5.2
percent economic growth in the 1998/99 year compared to
4.8 percent last year as well as on enticing the donor
community's support.
</P>
<P>
She said the Zanzibar national debt now stands at 145 billion
Shillings (220 million Dollars) with 71 billion Shillings (108
million Dollars) foreign debt and 74 billion Shillings (112
million Dollars) internal debt, surpassing the national budget by
nearly 150 percent.
</P>

hardly service the debts, both local and foreign," she said.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar Minister for Planning and Investment, Ali Juma
Shamhuna, presented the development plan which will execute 42
projects at a cost of 17.72 billion Shillings (17.79 million
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the government will put more emphasis on the
consolidation of free economic zones, free ports and especially
the tourism sector which collected 1.3 billion Shillings (1.98
million Dollars) from hotel levy during the ending fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Stick to Fiscal Prudence: Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa warned here
Wednesday that any deviation from the long-held philosophy of
fiscal prudence may give rise to speculative attacks again on the
Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks in response to calls for further tax cuts
in order to pull Hong Kong out of the current economic woes. He
told an economic conference Wednesday that the result of the
deviation may well be another increase in the already high
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
When the financial storm lashed Asia in the latter half of
1997, international speculators attempted to break the peg, which
linked the Hong Kong currency to the greenback at 7.8 HK dollars
to one U.S. dollar. Despite a few speculative attacks, the peg
stood firm and the currency remained stable, but interest rates in
Hong Kong soared.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, with the weakening of the yen this week, Hong Kong
currency is already under pressure in the form demonstrated in the
higher interbank interest rate in the last few days," said the
Hong Kong leader.
</P>
<P>
Tung delivered a luncheon speech at the Far Eastern Economic
Review's annual conference, which focuses on the impact of the
Asian financial crisis on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the 1998-99 financial budget presented on
February 18, the SAR government made the largest provision of
stimulus in history to boost the battered economy. Tax cuts plus
expenditure increases totaled 53 billion HK dollars (6.8 billion
U.S. dollars) in money terms, equal to four percent of Hong Kong's
GDP.
</P>
<P>
"We know the pain of the adjustment process but the budget
measures must be given time to work," said the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil has resulted in a high interest
rate and serious credit crunch in Hong Kong. Tung pledged that the
SAR government would take initiatives to improve liquidity in the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
As to the property prices that have fallen substantially over
the past few months, the chief executive said: "The government
does not wish to see a collapse of the property prices as this
will have serious impact on our banking system and will further
erode the already very weak consumer confidence."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Hong Kong was now in the depth of a major
economic adjustment, the result of which may be prolonged and
painful to everyone.
</P>
<P>
But he is confident that Hong Kong, with sound economic
fundamentals, would be able to go through the difficult period and
embark on the path of economic growth in the not-too-distant
future.

<HEADLINE> hke061065 - Pak Achieves Macro-economic Stability, Growth: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has achieved the twin
objectives of macro economic stability and growth as inflation
sharply declined during the 1997-98 fiscal year, said a
governmental economic survey Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Survey 1997-98 (July 1 1997- June 30 1998) was
released by Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz at a press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the government was able to pull the
crumbling economy out of oblivion as the real growth of the gross
domestic product (GDP) is estimated to be at 5.4 percent during
the current fiscal year as against 1.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
This growth was supported by the strong performance of the
agriculture sector which recorded a 5.9 percent growth followed by
a 7 percent increase in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Another notable development in the fiscal year has been the
sharp decline in the rate of inflation which declined to 8.2
percent during the first ten months against 11.6 percent of the
comparable period of last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey has nevertheless, noted a relative weak
performance in the tax collection, which forced government to
further revise the revenue target to 297.6 billion rupees (about
6.75 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year, the budget deficit is 5 percent of
the GDP while Last year's budget deficit was 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade balance during July-April 1997-98 registered a 54.2
percent improvement and stood at 1,325.2 million dollars as
against 2,895.9 million dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance during the first nine months of the
current fiscal year stood at 1,127 million dollars as against
3,288 million dollars in the corresponding period of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- An Palestinian was stabbed to
death Wednesday in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank,
apparently by his Jewish co-worker, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the killing was not yet known, Israel Radio
quoted police spokesman Linda Menuhin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two men were employed by a Jewish truck driver, who was
delivering soft drinks to the Jewish settlement Maale Efrayim.
</P>
<P>
The driver said he left for a few minutes and when he
returned, he found the Palestinian lying on the floor, bleeding
from a stomach wound. The Jewish co-worker had a knife in his
hand, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Police have detained the driver and the Jewish worker for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
But the names of the dead man and his co-worker were not
immediately made public.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Arab was slightly injured by stabbing in a
dispute with a Jew in Jerusalem Wednesday. The assailant told
police he was defending himself.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza Strip, a Palestinian was shot dead on Tuesday by
Israeli soldiers guarding a Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Confrontation between Israelis and the Palestinians in the
occupied area have escalated recently after Israel refused to
accept a U.S. proposal to pull back Israeli troops from 13 percent
more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks have been deeply stranded since
March last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts from international
organizations and Chinese departments related gathered here today to
discuss ways of fighting the illicit trafficking and smuggling of
cultural property.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Seminar on Fighting
Illicit Trafficking and Smuggling of Cultural Property, that opened
here today, will mainly focus on introducing international regulations
in the fight against the illicit trafficking of cultural property and
discuss measures China needs to adopt.
</P>
<P>
Lyndel Prott, a UNESCO official in charge of cultural property,
said the seminar aims to "facilitate cooperation with the
international communities in fighting against illegal activities
and to protect the cultural heritage of the mankind."
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which will last one week, is being attended by
experts from relevant international and Chinese organizations and
departments including UNESCO and the National Administration for
Cultural Heritage of China.
</P>
<P>
China is now faced with a tough situation of crimes involving
cultural property. In 1997, Chinese customs uncovered more than
600 cases of cultural property smuggling, and seized more than
11,200 items of cultural property.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Chinese public security departments cracked
5,000 cases of theft, smuggling and illicit sales of cultural
property, and seized more than 50,000 items.

<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Wednesday called on the two warring north African countries,
Eritrea and Ethiopia, to cease and refrain from all actions that
may lead to a further escalation of their border conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at his weekly press conference, Ramos
also said the Philippines supports the peace initiatives being
brokered by third parties, particularly those of the United States
and Rwanda, in seeking a peaceful solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippines believes that the United Nations
should also play a crucial role in bringing the warring states to
the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
He also assured Filipinos with relatives working in Eritrea,
that the government is exerting all efforts at evacuating overseas
Filipino workers based in Eritrea, most of whom are teachers and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing armed conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia flared
up last week because of a long-time territorial dispute, killing
dozens of civilians and displacing tens of thousands of others in
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> S. African Apartheid Regime Stockpiles Lethal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The former South African
military authorities manufactured poisons and biological agents
during the 1980s in amounts which could, theoretically, wipe out
entire populations, top scientists, who were involved in the
project, has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the poisons were used against internal "enemies of the
state," and deadly bacterial agents were also released in foreign
countries, Schalk van Rensburg, head of research at Roodeplaat
Research Laboratories (RRL), Tuesday told the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, a special court authorized by the
current government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Van Rensburg, bacteriologist Mike Odendaal, in
charge of manufacturing bacterial agents at RRL, and Johan
Koekemoer, senior research chemicist at Delta G Scientific, also
made evidence at the TRC hearing.
</P>
<P>
RRL and Delta G Scientific were military front companies
operating under Project Coast, the former South African
military's chemical and biological warfare project.
</P>
<P>
The scientists' evidence directly contradicts claims by the
previous government that the project was aimed purely at
developing a defensive capability.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the TRC heard, RRL was involved almost exclusively in
the manufacture of devastating bacteria and lethal poisons. These
include cultures of cholera, anthrax, salmonella, botulism and B.
melitensis, the bacterium which causes malta fever.
</P>
<P>
The deadly bacteria were freeze-dried and kept in cold storage
at RRL, from where they were dispensed on demand to military
operatives.
</P>
<P>
A plan was hatched to poison President Nelson Mandela after
his release from prison with a substance which would cause steady
deterioration of brain function, Van Rensburg said. But the plan was
not carried out.
</P>
<P>
Delta G Scientific manufactured almost one ton of the designer
drug ecstasy and a quarter ton of Mandrax as "incapacitating
agents" for possible use against the local population, the TRC
heard.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient quantities of cholera bacteria to affect the entire
population of Namibia were delivered to the military as late as
September 1989, shortly before the Namibian election.
</P>
<P>
Then-president F W de Klerk was briefed about RRL's activities
in 1990 and put a stop to offensive projects.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims of RRL's poisons was Frank Chikane, former
secretary-general of South African Council of Churches, now
Director-General in Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office. He
survived only because the attack was botched.
</P>
<P>
In another attack, a Russian adviser to the African National
Congress in Zambia was killed by anthrax spores secreted into his
food.

Also opened in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center,
in conjunction with the IBEX'98, were the International Security,
Protection and Safety Exposition and the International Building
Fitting, Finishes and Interior Decoration Exposition.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event provides a marketing platform for more than
200 companies from over 10 countries and regions. Italy has been
participating in IBEX for the 15th time, ever since the event's
inaugural presentation in 1979.
</P>
<P>
From this year on, the traditionally biennial event organized
by the Reed Exhibition Ltd. will be turned annual.
</P>
<P>
As this year's event was the first IBEX presentation since Hong
Kong's handover to China in July last year, it was more focused on
highlighting the trade links with China's inland areas. A
presentation on the development of China's building industry set
for Thursday has registered over 200 participants who are
interested in the China market.
</P>
<P>
The organizers had decided that next year's IBEX will mainly

<HEADLINE> Board Established to Promote Shipping Industry in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Economic Services
Stephen Ip of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said
here Wednesday that the setting up of the Hong Kong Port and
Maritime Board would help further promote the development of Hong
Kong's shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
The main function of the board is to co-ordinate and bring
together the resources of the government and the maritime sector
to promote Hong Kong as an international shipping center, support
Hong Kong's economic development and create new job opportunities,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Ip said that an important
initiative in the SAR government's effort to promote the Hong Kong
shipping industry is the expansion of the role of the Hong Kong
Port Development Board (PDB) to strengthen the link between the
government and the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
The new Hong Kong Port and Maritime Board was officially
established on June 1, 1998. All members are appointed by the
Chief Executive for a period of two years. The chairman is Peter
Thompson, an experienced maritime lawyer and former Port
Development Board chairman.
</P>
<P>
"The main strength of Hong Kong as an international shipping
center is that we are not only a shipowning center but we are also
a very important ship management center. Over 1,200 vessels plying
round the world are managed by Hong Kong companies," Ip noted.
</P>
<P>
At present around 500 ships are registered in Hong Kong with a
total tonnage of some six million tons and the shipping and
maritime industry directly contributes 1.7 per cent of Hong Kong's
GDP, according to Ip.
</P>
<P>
Ip said the Economic Services Bureau and the Marine Department
have been undertaking a series of initiatives to support and
encourage the development of Hong Kong's maritime industry, which

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Move Towards El Nino Predictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists believe
they will be able to improve drought forecasting by using advanced
technology to test water samples from the Indian and Pacific
Oceans.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO) and the Bureau of Meteorology scientists will combine for
the first time to analyze ocean currents and make forecasts about
the drought-causing El Nino phenomenon, believed to be explained
by the movement of warm and cold ocean currents.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations are looking to boost the effectiveness of
long-range predictions.
</P>
<P>
Nan Bray, CSIRO's marine research chief, told reporters that
while three months is the maximum time that scientists currently
require to predict the El Nino effect, they are working on
extending the forecasting range to a year.
</P>
<P>
Testing will be done from the research vessel the Franklin, at
present docked at Melbourne's Station Pier.
</P>
<P>
Equipment on the vessel can be dropped as deep as six
kilometers into the Indian or Pacific Ocean to take samples.
</P>
<P>
Bray said more accurate predictions on the El Nino can be made
by measuring salinity content, nutrient levels and examining where
the water is going and where it has been.
</P>
<P>
He said the next step would be to provide advice for the
individual needs of farmers in different parts of the country,
taking into consideration the moisture content of soil and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
But the extent to which scientists can be sure of an El Nino
forecast remains limited.
</P>
<P>
"That's part of our risk assessment .. how much we're willing
to put on the line," said Bray. "(But) once the water is in the
direction of El Nino, it doesn't seem to go back."
</P>
<P>
Scientists still do not fully understand what sets off the El
Nino effect and CSIRO climatologist Gary Elder said Australia was
working in collaboration with America, Japan and France to
investigate causes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Slides Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso depreciated
further Wednesday to 40.27 to the U.S. dollar in the afternoon
trading from Tuesday's 39.40 due to high corporate demand and the
sliding trend of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The peso opened at 39.21 against the dollar at the Philippine
Dealing System, stronger than Tuesday's close of 39.40, but it
subsequently weakened in the morning trade.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the peso weakened further, like other
currencies in the region. It closed at 40.06 to the greenback,
recovering from the day's high of 40.47, the lowest in about a
month.
</P>
<P>
The average for the day was 39.77 pesos to the dollar compared
with Tuesday's average of 39.47.
</P>
<P>
At 164.5 million dollars, Wednesday's transaction volume was
two times higher than the 77.75 million dollars traded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the continued fall of the Japanese yen, which
was traded around 140.70 against the dollar, put pressure on all
regional currencies, including the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, the peso can still be considered "delinked"
from the regional currency movement, as its fall was much lower
than other currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
High corporate demand also added to the pressure for the peso's
depreciation, the dealers said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank Optimistic about Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Central Bank has said that
attainment of a nine percent inflation rate and 4.5 percent
growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) still remains the
country's realistic goals this year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted Felix Kani, Director of
Economics of the Bank of Zambia (BOZ), as saying Tuesday "We
remain optimistic that we shall achieve the stipulated goals but
of course we should leave room for any unforeseen circumstances
which could lead to some changes, but for the time being we are
on course."
</P>
<P>
According the bank, the exchange rate of the country's
currency, Kwacha, has been stable in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the stability to the recent consultative
group meeting held in Paris and intervening measures the bank
undertook.
</P>
<P>
Kani said that the Kwacha is largely expected to remain stable
if the current economic trends continue.
</P>
<P>
He said the economy has been on course in the past six months
and the targets in the budget still remain realistic.
</P>
<P>
At the Paris meeting held last month, donors pledged Zambia
530 million U.S. Dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
Several months earlier, an increased demand for foreign
currencies and shortage of them pushed the exchange rate of
Kwacha down considerably.

JINAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Jinan city, capital of east China's
Shandong province, has made great efforts to renovate 13 blocked
springs.
</P>
<P>
Jinan, famous for the "city of springs", has 162 springs. But
recent years' urban construction and overuse of underground water
did damages to the springs. By 1997, 16 springs have disappeared
and another 21 ones being blocked.
</P>
<P>
In June 1997, the local government issued a regulation to
protect these springs and set up a special organization to take
the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
A large scale renovation was launched in the meantime. In last
year only, the local government allocated 300,000 yuan to redig
the blocked springs and build protecting facilities around the
springs.
</P>
<P>
According to plan, it will repair another 15 springs this year
with investment of 500,000 yuan and all other blocked ones in
three years.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Set Up Fund for Chemical Agent Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to set up a fund for
victims of agent orange, a chemical weapon used by American
soldiers in the Vietnam War, reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As decided by Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, the fund
will be handled by the Vietnam's Red Cross to help mobilize
humanitarian donations both at home and abroad for the victims.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Vietnam's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday the war
has left enormous consequences, including the long-term and heavy
effects of toxic chemicals, onto the Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics showed that more than two million
Vietnamese people are affected by various kinds of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
More than one million hectares of affected forests cannot be
naturally recovered, causing soil erosions, flooding during rainy
seasons and droughts during dry seasons, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government is calling for external cooperation
for its project to assess the existence of toxic chemicals in the
country and to evaluate their impacts on people and environment.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Dips Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar Wednesday
continued a relentless slide toward 58 U.S. cents, even below the
lowest level of 59.60 12 years ago, despite boosted efforts by the
federal government to shore up confidence in the ailing currency.
</P>
<P>
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello and Prime Minister John Howard
hit the airwaves Wednesday to talk up the economy and its ability
to withstand currency troubles without an interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the fall in the Australian dollar was linked to
the slump in Asian currencies, and stressed the need for dealers
to take into account the economy's strong fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no case for banks to boost home loan rates,
as the Reserve Bank had not increased official cash rates.
</P>
<P>
Costello told radio 3AW, "The important thing for those that
are looking for long-term values is to look at the fundamentals -
and the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong."
</P>
<P>
The treasurer ruled out the possibility of a recession for
Australia, saying the economy's growth was probably the fastest in
the world, but conceded that it was expected to slow.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's export performance to ASEAN countries was
expected to pick up in 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Prime Minister John Howard spoke on Sydney
radio of the economy's low inflation, strong business investment
and projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
"When you look around our region, the things that really count
in the medium to longer term are very strong in Australia," Howard
told Radio 2BL.
</P>
<P>
However, the efforts made by the political leaders seemed to
have little effect with the Australian dollar closing at 58.29
U.S. cents from Tuesday's local close of 59.78.
</P>
<P>
The previous lowest closing rate for the local currency was
59.60 U.S. cents on July 31, 1986.
</P>
<P>
The National Australia Bank (NAB) business survey said
Australia's economic growth would be just 1.75 percent in 1998/99
- compared with the government's 3.0 percent prediction - and that
official cash rates would rise in the next month or so.
</P>
<P>
NAB chief economist Alan Oster warned the Australian dollar
could fall to 57 U.S. cents without a rate hike.

<P>
KUNMING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Labor and Employment Bureau of
southwest China's Yunnan Province has recently received 300,000
yuan (about 37,000 US dollars) as the first batch of donation for
the reemployment project.
</P>
<P>
The donation came from an advertisement corporation and it was
the first social donation the bureau received, said Bao Yun,
deputy director of the Labor Department of the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
China will mobilize all sectors of society to support the
reemployment project, an official with the Ministry of Labor and
Social Security said.
</P>
<P>
The number of laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises has
grown rapidly in recent years, reaching more than 11 million by
the end of last year. Yunnan Province has nearly 200,000 laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has allocated 20 million yuan for the
project, whose expenses will be shared out equally by the central
government, enterprises and society.
</P>
<P>
It will take about five years for China to complete the
adjustment of personnel structure of state-owned enterprises, said
the official.

ROME, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Italian city of Milan
Tuesday arrested 125 people on alleged using drug-related profits
to help fund fighting in the Serbian province of Kosovo and
terrorist operations in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Police also caught 100 kilograms of cocaine and heroin from the
criminal organization, whose members include 30 ethnic Albanians
noted by the police as of "particular importance."
</P>
<P>
These ethnic Albanians were progressively merging with Mafia
clans to help move enormous quatities of narcotics from locations
in eastern Europe to thriving markets in the West, police said.
</P>
<P>
The gang members then used the money to buy weapons in Italy
and smuggle them into to Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are in a
bloody struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
Some other members of the group were involved in the money
laundry wing of the criminal operations, depositing millions of
U.S. dollars in Swiss banks and using the profits for terrorist
operations in Egypt, said the police.
</P>
<P>
All the arrested have been charged with conspiracy to traffic
in arms and narcotics.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM to Announce National Agenda Against Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif will announce a national agenda in his address to the
nation Thursday to combat economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's speech will be broadcast live by Radio
Pakistan and Pakistan Television at 2000 hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agenda will envisage austerity measures to be adopted both
at official and public levels to minimize the impact of the
economic sanctions on the country's economy, government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to announce drastic cut in the
administrative expenditure to override the situation, they said.
</P>
<P>
The national budget for the year 1998-99 (from July 1, 1998 to
June 30 1999) will also be finalized in the light of the national
agenda, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani parliament Wednesday adopted a resolution
to impose a six-month emergency in the country to enable the
government to deal with the post-nuclear test situation.
</P>
<P>
Following Pakistan's nuclear tests in late May in response to
the Indian provocation, some Western countries including the
United States and Japan announced economic sanctions against
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Pakistan will be hit harder than India by the
Western sanctions as the country's economy is very dependent on
foreign aid and loans.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Down on Currency, Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
Wednesday closed weaker on concerns over the downward pressure on
the Australian dollar and fears that interest rates could rise.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed down 31 points, or 1.18
percent, at 2,592.9, but off its low of 2,582.9.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed 7.1 points weaker at 1,061.2 and
the all industrials index was 59.7 points lower at 4,501.0.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar at the end of local trading was worth
58.32 U.S. cents, down from 59.81 U.S. cents at the previous
session close, and off an intraday low of 58.09 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Ausbil Xiradis, a funds manager, said the Australian dollar was
"probably getting close to its bottom" and "it appears that there
is not going to be any change to interest rates" by the Reserve
Bank of Australia, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He said this had helped the market pick up off its low in the
afternoon session with News Corp. leading the way.
</P>
<P>
Market heavyweight News Corp. gained 14 cents, or 1.40 percent,
to 10.14 Australian dollars and its preferred scrip gained 9
cents, or 1.03 percent, to 8.82 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said that because News Corp. earned a significant
amount in the United States it was relatively insulated by the
downward pressure on the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank shares dropped 45.1 cents, or 2.07
percent, to 21.303 Australian dollars, Commonwealth Bank of
Australia fell 27 cents, or 1.50 percent, to 17.73 Australian
dollars, and ANZ Banking Corp. slipped 18 cents, or 1.66 percent,
to 10.67 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Westpac Banking Corp. rose 5 cents, or 0.52 percent, to
9.60 Australian dollars, with brokers saying the bank had bucked
the trend because it had recently gone ex-dividend and been
oversold.
</P>
<P>
"The stock has come back fairly savagely since it went
ex-dividend," said Xiradis, adding that Westpac's share buyback
scheme could have contributed.
</P>
<P>
Major resource stocks finished mixed, with Australia's leading
company BHP closing down 10 cents at 13.44 Australian dollars, and
global miner Rio Tinto falling two cents to 19.65 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index gained 1.9 points to 1,126.1.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion closed 4.75 U.S. dollars lower at 290.75 U.S.
dollars in Sydney trading. It was trading at 291.55 U.S. dollars
at midday.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 338.78 million shares valued at 629.8
million U.S. dollars, with falls easily outnumbering rises by 874
to 376, and 419 stocks were steady.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Falls by Nearly 1.5 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The battered Australian dollar
lost nearly one and a half U.S. cents Wednesday to dive through
the key 59 U.S. cent barrier to a record post-float closing low.
</P>
<P>
The currency touched 58.09 U.S. cents Wednesday before
recovering slightly to end at 58.32 U.S. cents, its lowest close
since 1986, down from 59.81 U.S. cents at Tuesday's session in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The battered local dollar continues to nudge at all time
post-float record lows reached on July 28, 1986 after then
treasurer Paul Keating warned Australia of becoming a banana
republic when commenting on the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Mike Hollows, a foreign exchange manager, said with sentiment
towards the Asian currencies and especially the Japanese yen being
particularly bearish Wednesday "the Australian dollar is looking
quite vulnerable".
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar is comfortably trading below 60.00 U.S.
cents and not even looking like rallying," he said. "I guess the
all-time low is beckoning."
</P>
<P>
Traders warned the Australian dollar, which reached its
previous lowest close of 59.60 U.S. cents on July 31, 1986, could
now head towards its all time post-float intraday low of 57.10,
seen on July 28 that year.
</P>
<P>
At the close locally, the Australian dollar was sharply lower
against the Japanese yen at 82.35 from 84.06 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The currency was also buying 1.0385 German marks from 1.0626
marks.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Oil Companies to Join on Gas Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China National Offshore Oil
Corp. (CNOOC) and Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) of the United
States have agreed to conduct joint study for possible development
of the Ledong natural gas fields in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
An agreement, signed Tuesday in ARCO's headquarters of Los
Angeles by the two partners, will increase the chances of jointly
developing the Ledong natural gas fields and the nearby Wenchang
area where natural gas was previously discovered.
</P>
<P>
The three Ledong fields, of about 925 square kilometers, were
discovered in 1996 by China National Offshore Nanhai Corporation,
a CNOOC subsidiary, some 100 kilometers southwest of Hainan Island.
</P>
<P>
In the 463-square-kilometer Wenchang area, two of the three
geological structures have been drilled and found to contain gas.
</P>
<P>
Both Ledong and Wenchang are near the 770-kilometer pipeline
that currently carries natural gas to Hong Kong and Hainan Island
from Yacheng 13-1 gas field.
</P>
<P>
"Adding Wenchang to our study of Ledong fields brings a whole
new dimension to this project," said ARCO's president William Wade.
</P>
<P>
"If development proceeds, the project will enable both
companies to build additional value in the South China Sea and
supply cleaner-burning natural gas for the energy growth needs of
southern China," Wade said.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies currently underway include an engineering
and geological evaluation of the fields, an assessment of
recoverable reserves, and identification of possible markets for
the gas.
</P>
<P>
If the area is concluded worthy of joint development, said
CNOOC President Wang Yan, "I will come back as early as September
to sign an official agreement to start the joint development of
Ledong/Wenchang natural gas fields."
</P>
<P>
Wang predicted that given the rising energy need in southern
China, the joint investment would hit over one billion U.S. dollar
with a greater profit.

eight banks in Pudong are expected to be hooked up with the system
by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The eight banks are Industrial Bank of Japan, Dai Ichi Kangyo
Bank, Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Co., Bankque Indosuez, Sanwa Bank and Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
They were approved to begin Renminbi-based business in Pudong
over a year ago and became members of the National Inter-Bank
Market last April.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials say that the move illustrates China's
determination of a gradual opening-up of its financial sector in
spite of the financial crisis in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
To date, nine overseas banks have been allowed limited access
to the local currency business. By the end of last March, their
Renminbi assets totaled 916 million yuan, with outstanding loans
totaling 591 million yuan and deposits 566 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe that this latest development will not
have much impact on China's bond market in the short term because
the banks' Renminbi assets are still small.

<P>
In the meantime, bond trading of the overseas banks are limited
within the inter-bank market, which is currently separated from
those of the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts regard the overseas banks' joining in
China's inter-bank bond trading as having a long-term positive
impact on country's financial market.
</P>
<P>
The changes of interest rates on the inter-bank market will
become more rational to reflect the actual balance between capital
demand and supply, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
"Though the foreign banks do not necessarily make large
transactions, their long-established reputation in capital
management will definitely have some influence on other dealers in
rate offering," an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the overseas banks' entry will push their Chinese
counterparts to further improve their internal management and help
increase market efficiency.
</P>
<P>
China has kept to open its financial market to foreign banks
for the past decade. Central bank figures show that there are now
more than 700 branches and representative offices of overseas
financial institutions in China at present.
</P>
<P>
A few foreign insurance companies have also started business in
China.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, central bank governor, told a symposium here
Tuesday that China is considering to allow more foreign banks to
start Renminbi-based business and approve more foreign insurance
companies to enter the Chinese insurance market in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Computer Learning for Children in Impoverished Parts of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- As computers become more common
for people in eastern China's large cities, children in some
impoverished areas also want a chance to learn more about them.
</P>
<P>
Zholma, a fourteen-year-old Tibetan girl from China's Qinghai
Province, says, "I want to learn about computers. If I have the
chance to learn about computers, I will help our town get rid of
poverty."
</P>
<P>
The China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) started
a project today to do something about this and to get people to
donate computers and educational materials to children in China's
impoverished areas. Its magazine "Popsoft" donated 50 computers
today to the project and plans to set up two classrooms for
computer education in Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
A recent study showed that none of the 389 primary schools in
Xining, Qinghai's capital, has a computer, and only 16 percent of
the 97 middle schools in the city have computers. And, the only
computer classroom, in the city's children's center, has 26
outmoded computers. More than a hundred children can be seen
elbowing each other there, and four or five share one computer, a
teacher says.
</P>
<P>
Science and education are backward in many parts of central and
western China, and their economy is underdeveloped, according to
He Yucheng, a Qinghai official, and developing them is the only
way to get rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, CAST's president, has asked local governments
to spend more on education, and he has asked the rest of society
to pay more attention to improving the quality of life in
impoverished areas.

<HEADLINE> Pak Parliament Approves Emergency Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The federal Parliament of
Pakistan Wednesday approved the emergency proclaimed by President
Rafiq Tarar on May 28 in the wake of Pakistan's five nuclear tests
the same day.
</P>
<P>
After a four-day hectic debate, the joint session of the
Parliament approved the resolution on imposing a six-month
emergency in the country by a vote of 166 in favor against 50.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices on May 28, 17 days after
India's nuclear tests. President Tarar promulgated the emergency
late in the night of May 28 which included certain temporary
restrictions on foreign exchange and suspending of fundamental
rights of the citizens.
</P>
<P>
Although the emergency was approved by a comfortable margin,
all government allied groups stayed away from Wednesday's session
which was specially summoned to approve the imposition of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Muslim League (N) achieved the support of the
deputies from the Federal Administered Tribal Areas and minorities
while the main opposition People's Party, Awami National Party and
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam opposed the emergency.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif imposed emergency
to deal with "foreign threats and the country's economic
condition". All foreign accounts were frozen after the state of
emergency was imposed.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition vehemently opposed the proclamation of
emergency and accused the government of usurping the fundamental
rights of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition contended that the emergency had nothing to do
with either the threat perception or the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"It has been imposed only to avoid the imminent economic
collapse. Had there been any external threat, the emergency would
have been imposed soon after India had carried out five nuclear
explosions," the opposition claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, the government believed that it had become inevitable
to take such measures at a time when Pakistan was confronted with
an extraordinary situation.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan was facing dire challenges to its security and
economy in the wake of nuclear tests carried out in response to
the Indian provocations," the Treasury benches said.

<HEADLINE> China's Shanghai Opens Hotline to Boost Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- This economic and financial
center of China just opened a telephone hotline in an effort to
improve foreign trade and draw more investment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The hotline, (021) 6275-1815, is primarily meant to serve the
17,900 overseas-funded enterprises, 4,000-strong representative
offices of overseas companies, 200-odd multinational corporations,
consulates of 32 nations, and 700-plus foreign trade companies in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
From now on, anyone who come to trouble or have problems
pertinent to foreign trade and economic cooperation in Shanghai
can dial the hotline for help.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaoming, director of Shanghai Municipal Foreign Trade
Commission, said that overseas investment in Shanghai has entered
a period of slow growth at the high level and the foreign trade
enterprises have met with unprecedented difficulties because of
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the government must do better in smoothing
information flow and providing policy services to make Shanghai
more competitive in terms of foreign trade and the use of overseas
investment," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that starting this year Shanghai will publish
details of its foreign trade and use of overseas investment twice
a year and will open on the Internet a page about Shanghai's
foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Related policies, rules and regulations, and other information
will be published regularly in the mass media.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, Shanghai will take advantage of its agencies
stationed overseas to help potential investors obtain more
knowledge of the city.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will soon publish a detailed set of rules on the
approval of overseas investment, further expanding the power of
the Pudong New Area and the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in approving
investment in their respective areas, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Calls for Closer Cooperation with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has called for cooperation
with Iran to facilitate the transit of people and cargo between
the two countries while enhancing joint efforts in combating drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammad Khaled
Al-Hamad Al-Sabah made the appeal in talks with his Iranian
counterpart Abdollah Nouri Tuesday, the official news agency IRNA
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said Iranians living in Kuwait have amounted to 62,000
from 40,000 before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and he has
been authorized by the Kuwaiti leadership to provide necessary
living facilities for them.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah also said Kuwait is interested in developing
cooperation with Iran in all fields of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister, on his part, hoped the problems between
the two countries, if any, could be solved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has adopted a constant positive stand in
supporting Kuwaiti sovereignty in international and regional
forums and is determined to further friendly ties with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Big strides have been made to consolidate Iran-Kuwait bonds, he
said, stressing that exchange of visits by officials of the two
countries would undoubtedly ensure the protection of national
interests and help solve any possible problems.
</P>
<P>
Sabah arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit, during which
he and Nouri would also oversee the signing of a string of
agreements on security cooperation between the two countries.

after France organized the third World Cup, it is hosting the
sports competition which is the most popular, most covered by the

Tuesday night. The number of spectators stood around 200,000 in the
streets of the capital. The long television transmission and the
slow moving of the procession could have discouraged Parisians from

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plummet in Tokyo Due to Falling Bank Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled 190.91 points
in Tokyo Wednesday as bank shares fell sharply due to the
unraveling of cross-shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished at 15,339.26, down
1.23 percent from Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) covering all First Section
issues dropped 10.08 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,198.60.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the First Section grew to an estimated 350 million
shares from Tuesday's 315 million shares. And long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan was Wednesday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Falling prices on the Hong Kong stock market also contributed
to the Tokyo stock market's decrease, but the downslide was slowed
by bargain-hunting Japanese pension funds, traders said.
</P>
<P>
While profit-taking during the morning trading session pushed
share prices down, concerns over the sagging Hong Kong stock index
and Japanese banks' poor health were behind the overall decline.
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks also helped push Tokyo stock prices downward,
with declines seen across the board, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,336 issues listed on the First Section, losers
surpassed gainers 746 to 352, with 145 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> S. African Scientists Make Breakthrough in Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- South African researchers
have developed a new series of compounds which it is hoped could
have an impact in the fight against cancer.
</P>
<P>
The eight new molecules developed by researchers at the
University of Pretoria could reduce the cost of treating cancer,
tuberculosis (TB) and malaria by allowing doctors to treat
patients with older drugs which have become ineffective as these
diseases are resistant to them, The Star daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new molecules, called Riminophenazines, have slowed the
growth of cancer in laboratory tests. Although the research into
TB is not as far advanced as the cancer research, it is hoped the
Riminophenazines could help save the country millions of Rand.
</P>
<P>
Professors Connie Medlen and Ronnie Anderson, along with team
spokesman Johan Spence, have been working on the specific project
for the past six years and achieved the milestone of having the
molecules patented in the United States Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But it will take at least five years before the drug becomes
available to the public. Researchers still have to conduct
clinical trials -- testing the drug first on animals, then on
healthy human volunteers before it is tested on cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for a partner now, South African or
international, to develop it further. Clearly, the
ground-breaking work was done here and there needs to be some
benefit to South Africa," Spence said.
</P>
<P>
Riminophenazines work like no other cancer drugs currently on
the market. Instead of attacking the brain of the cell, the
nucleus, or other vital parts of the cell, the new molecules act
on the outer wall of the cell.
</P>
<P>
This is said to slow down the rate at which the cells can
absorb Potassium, a vital element needed for the cell to grow and
multiply, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
Cancer cells grow faster and absorb about three times as much
Potassium as normal cells, but Riminophenazines reportedly reduce
the Potassium uptake significantly.
</P>
<P>
The other significant effect of these molecules has wider
significance than just cancer treatment. One of the major
problems faced by doctors and drug companies is that viruses and
bacteria develop a resistance to specific drugs and they become
almost useless, necessitating the development of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
The disease cells recognize the drug and pump it out of the
cell as soon as it enters and the drug has no effect.
</P>
<P>
Riminophenazines make the drug stay inside the cell and can
therefore act to kill the disease cell.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Likely to Be Dissolved: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti National Assembly
(Parliament) is likely to be dissolved at weekend due to its
stand-off with the Cabinet over the probing of the interior
minister, local newspapers reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources were quoted by the reports as saying that
government leaders met on Tuesday to review the stand-off and came
to a conclusion that dissolution of the National Assembly is the
best way to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the government leaders have decided to send a
letter to Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, saying
cooperation is no longer possible between the Cabinet and the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The assembly has demanded that Interior Minister Sheikh
Mahammad Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah be investigated for alleged
responsibility for "the spread of crimes and corruption in various
bodies of his ministry."
</P>
<P>
But the Cabinet has vehemently opposed the move.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet also has discovered that the assembly is planning
to investigate the ministers of health, defense, and justice and
Islamic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Observers here pointed out the current political crisis has
been aggravated by other controversial issues, including a
government proposal to raise fuel prices and public service
charges.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament was against the price hikes, a move it says will
exert negative impact on low-income citizens.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that at least 12 parliament members have
submitted resignation due to the inevitability of the parliament
dissolution.

<HEADLINE> Ecology of Inner Mongolia Grasslands Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The deterioration of the ecology of
Inner Mongolia's vast grasslands in north China is accelerating,
according to Hao Yidong, vice-chairman of the autonomous regional
government.
</P>
<P>
Some 38.7 million hectares of Inner Mongolia's grassland is
degenerating and subject to desertification. The total area is
expanding by some one million hectares annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hao said the current speed of grassland construction in the
autonomous region lags behind the speed of degeneration and
desertification, which poses a threat to the environment of north
China.
</P>
<P>
With 90 million hectares of grassland, some 76.5 percent of its
total area, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plans to bring
the deterioration under control by 2,000, and by 2,010 the
autonomous region expects a remarkable improvement in its
environment, according to an ambitious plan of the regional
government.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region plans to build 2 million hectares of
grassland this year, and 350,000 hecyares built by planting
grass.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has called on local
governments to transform desertified farmland into husbandry bases
and vowed to strike hard at those who illicitly exploit grasslands
for other purposes.

<P>
TIANJIN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The first non-state-owned science
park opened recently at the Tanggu Marine High-tech Park near
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The science park covers an area of 400,000 square meters. It

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning Province plans
to get 1.1 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign loans for
pollution control on the Liaohe River, urban infrastructure, and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is China's largest and oldest heavy industrial base
and has serious pollution problems. It has a tenth of the country's
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and is known for
its iron and steel, machinery, power, and building materials
industries.
</P>
<P>
The province emits 900 billion cubic meters of waste gas
annually, and 2.2 billion tons of industrial and human waste. The
Liaohe, which is used by eight cities and over half the province's
people, is one of the country's most seriously polluted rivers.
</P>
<P>
Du Qiugen, the head of the provincial environment protection
bureau, says that the need for environment's protection is urgent.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the province has used 140 million U.S.
dollars worth of foreign loans for environmental protection
projects like sewage treatment, energy research, and saving water,
and has spent 2.8 billion yuan stopping industrial pollution over
the past five years, Du says.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's problems are mainly with the water, so the
environment protection emphasis will be on stopping water
pollution, he says. It will set up over twenty sewage treatment
plants in cities and 140 projects to stop industrial pollution at
the source.

<HEADLINE> Air France Pilots, Management Reach Deal to End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The striking pilots of Air France
and the company's management have signed an agreement to end the
10-day long strike, said the biggest pilots union SNPL and the
management in a joint communique Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached hours before the football World Cup
will be officially opened in the Stadium of France and as
criticism against the strikers is rising from both the government
and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The SNPL, which represents most of the 3,200 pilots of Air
France, asked the pilots to resume flights as soon as possible as
the 10-day long strike is still paralyzing three fourths of the
flights and has already cost the company one billion francs (167
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the pilots will participate in
improving the competitiveness of Air France by becoming the
stock-holders of the company in exchange for a reduction of their
salaries.
</P>
<P>
Air France is trying to partially privatize its stocks and to
reduce the payroll of its employees by 500 million francs (83
million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The management agreed to scrap the double standard in pays for
the company's older and younger pilots, and instead establish a
specific pay system for the young pilots whose training costs are
paid by the company.
</P>
<P>
The pilots and management also agree to negotiate in the
following years an agreement on establishing stable relations
between them, which are based around policy-making, employment
and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Following the agreement passed, the SNPL calls on pilots to
resume flights ... the most rapidly possible," said the SNPL.
</P>
<P>
The management has already signed an agreement to end the
conflict with a minority pilot's union Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) and the Santa Fee Energy Co.Ltd of the US have found
a new oilfield in the basin of Zhujiang River Mouth in South China
Sea, through joint exploration.
</P>
<P>
The new offshore oilfield, Panyu 4-2, is located some 160
kilometers southeast of Hong Kong in 15/34 block of South China
Sea contracted by the Santa Fee company, which is expected to have
geological oil reserves topping 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the CNOOC source, the 15/34 block was contracted
to Santa Fee in January 1997. So far, a group of oil and gas
bearing structures including Panyu 2-1, Panyu 4-2, Panyu 9-2 have
been found in the block.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the newly-discovered Panyu 4-2 oilfield is
rich in oil and gas reserves, with oil layer extending 169.2
meters in thickness.
</P>
<P>
A CNOOC official noted that the discovery of Panyu 4-2 oilfield
proves to be another major breakthrough following Xijiang 34-3
oil-bearing structure in the basin of Zhujiang River Mouth of
South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the offshore Panyu area to be the fifth group of
oilfields in the eastern part of the Zhujiang River Mouth Basin
after the successful exploration of oilfield groups of Huizhou,
Xijiang, Lufeng and Liuhua.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Region Fighting Last Campaign to End Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China has launched a decisive battle to fight
poverty in an attempt to bring its remaining 740,000 poor farmers
out of difficulties by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The region began poverty relief work in 1986, and has
intensified its efforts in this regard over the past few years. As
a result, it reduced the poor population from 1.43 million to
740,000.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, more than 200,000 people, one-third
of whom were officials from governments, enterprises and
institutions, participated in pair-cooperation on poverty relief
activities, involving some 250,000 rural households to cover more
than 80 percent of the total impoverished population.
</P>
<P>
Hotan Prefecture in southern Xinjiang, for example, has
received several hundred million yuan in aid over the past few
years to cultivate 20,000 hectares of wasteland, and cut local
poor population by more than half.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement projects have also contributed to the effort, and
many poor farmers have considerably improved their living
conditions moving elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The region focuses its poverty eradication on agriculture-based
industries, supported by scientific achievements such as maize
planting using plastic sheeting techniques, high-yield cotton
developments, fast fattening techniques for sheep and cattle, and
other farm produce and livestock processing techniques.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, maize output increased by more than 30 percent in
poor areas last year, and farmers' per capita income in 30 poor
counties was raised from 759 yuan three years ago to 906 yuan last
year.
</P>
<P>
Local goverment will give priority to rural infrastructure,
scientific training, and application of practical agro-techniques
in the process to aid the poor.

Under the early summer sun at weekends, tourists are flocking

vegetables, pick up fruit, and go fishing.
</P>
<P>
Some of them even rent a small plot to grow whatever they
choose, apart from enjoying the fresh air to the full.

The computerized greenhouse planting is certainly something
tourists do not want to miss. They can not only appreciate plump

One farm in Chaoyang district alone attracts 30,000 tourists
from the city every year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Bank Mergers Expected in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
 Wednesday foresaw the possibility of more mergers of small banks
with big ones before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said those cash-strapped
small banks will have to merge with large banks in order to avoid
cash flow problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the requirement of the central bank to
raise banks' operating capital to a new height is expected to
result in more bank mergers.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the central bank has decided to gradually raise
banks' operating capital until it reaches the limit set by the
government up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to him, small banks such as the Unisave Bank and
Capitol Bank are now seeking merger with two big banks.
</P>
<P>
Singson did not explain how much the new banks' operating
capital should be. But he admitted that the capital hike will be
done in stages, possibly every six months from the effectivity of
the central bank's ruling.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Singson clarified that the central
bank management meet with the Orient Bank depositors every week to
assure them that the cash-strapped Orient Bank will not be totally
closed as others fear.
</P>
<P>
According to him, if the central bank will permanently close
Orient Bank, it is likely that many of the depositors with more
than 100,000 pesos (2,500 U.S. dollars) in deposit accounts will
not be paid.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation
is only responsible for a maximum of 100,000 pesos as mandated by
the insurance law.

<HEADLINE> Austerity Budget Expected to Kick-Start Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae is expected to present Thursday to parliament an
austerity budget aimed at reviving the battled economy.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the east African country fell from 4.6
percent in 1996 to 2.3 percent last year. Analysts said the
mounting budget deficit now is perhaps the key issue facing
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Measures included in the budget can only work if the
government reduces expenditure and collects more taxes, they
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya's tax collections have been on the increase
over the past few years. But that the government now is being
questioned about the use of public revenue, makes such a move
difficult.
</P>
<P>
"Given that revenue collection increases are not going to be
easy, government expenditure has to be tackled head on. This seems
to be the only way to reduce the budget deficit," Nikhil Hira, a
local economic analyst, claims.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that the government will increase the tax
brackets in an effort to increase consumers' disposable (after
tax) incomes and stimulate consumer spending for the sake of
faster economic recovery, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to speed up privatization and civil
service reform plans as inefficient parastatals have been a drain
on the exchequer for too long and the current wage bills in the
public sector is too high and unsustainable in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"The current high level of interest rates is indicative of the
harmful effect of the budget deficit," they add.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Thursday's reading, the Kenya Shilling has, however,
remained stable as traders wait to see the effect of the budget
on the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
A daily market bulletin from the Standard Chartered Bank said
Tuesday that, despite heavy inflows of hard currency from
exporters, large buy orders from corporate clients contained the
Shilling at just below the 61-Shilling mark to the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said that the budget could drive the market
either way, which has made both the buy and sell counters to
remain active.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's budget, Kenyans have seen a hike in the
standard and lower rate of value added tax (VAT) of two percent,
which has had its greatest impact on the poor, in a declining
economy.
</P>
<P>
Promises of realizing higher growth and alleviating poverty in
the 1997/98 budget also came to naught as the economy is
currently in a recession. It is estimated that nearly 46 percent
of the population is living in conditions of absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
The other trend in past budgets is the tendency to increase
indirect taxes. This usually involves raising the rates of value
added tax (VAT) on various commodities.
</P>
<P>
However, the Central Bank of Kenya predicts that the slowdown
in Kenya's economic growth since 1997 can be reversed by the
second half this year.
</P>
<P>
Investor confidence will also be restored particularly with
the expected resumption of 205-million-U.S.-Dollar aid package by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) later this year, the bank
announced earlier.
</P>
<P>
The IMF cut the loans to Kenya under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility at the end of last July, citing rampant
corruption and poor governance in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Real U.S. Moves to Abandon Hostility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran has urged the United States to
take real actions to abandon its hostility toward Tehran so as to
pave the way for improving bilateral relations, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American Affairs Morteza
Sarmadi was quoted as saying that Washington's good words and kind
gestures could not be a substitute for good deeds.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi focused blame on Israel, who he said instigated
Washington to paint an erroneous picture of Iran. But this effort
"had failed by the presence on all scenes of the Iranian people
and especially by their massive participation in the presidential
elections" in May last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The absence of support to the U.S. by other countries in its
continuing schemes against Iran is a proof of Tehran's plausible
diplomacy worldwide, the official added.
</P>
<P>
He attacked Israel and pro-Israeli pressure groups in the
U.S. for trying to distort Iran's image in a bid to prevent the
closeness of human societies.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi made the remarks after Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi granted an interview to the Cable News Network in New
York, in which Kharrazi blamed the U.S. government for continuing
its hostile policies toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the U.S. General Assembly on Drugs,
Kharrazi said the U.S. is not yet qualified for rapprochement with
Iran on the basis of mutual respect and equal rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which repeatedly accuses Iran of sponsoring
terrorism, undermining the Middle East peace process and seeking
weapons of mass destruction, has been exerting desperate efforts
to isolate Tehran in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Tehran, on the other hand, attacked Washington for supporting
Israel and adopting arrogant policies towards other countries.
</P>
<P>
But since the ascendance to power of Iran's moderate President
Mohammad Khatami last August, both Tehran and Washington have
softened their harsh tones and signs were emerging indicating that
the two arch enemies were moving toward opening a "crack in the
war of mistrust."
</P>
<P>
Senior Iranian officials have hinted that Iran-U.S. relations
could be improved if Washington drops accusations against Tehran
and takes concrete steps to solve the financial disputes with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Hague International Court granted Iran an
extension of three months to reply to the U.S. counter-claim over
the destruction of three Iranian oil platforms in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Iran has demanded compensation for the platforms destroyed by
U.S. war ships during the Iran-Iraq war between 1980 and 1988. But
the U.S. argued that the platforms were used in military actions
that were detrimental and dangerous to maritime commerce.

Cannonball Rally.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said they were driving back to Kampala in the
second leg of the 1,500 km rally expected to end Tuesday, when
Tebere lost control of their Toyota car on the slippery road
after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Their bodies were flown back to Kampala Tuesday. The body of
Rashid Mudin was buried later in the day at a cemetery in Kampala
while that of Richard Tebere would be laid to rest at his
home town in Gulu district Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets With Vietnamese Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, the Defense Minister
and Vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, in a
meeting here today with Vietnam's National Defense Minister
General Pham Van Tra, said that China and Vietnam had fast
recovery and development in bilateral friendly cooperative ties in
politics, the economy, science and technology and cultural affairs
after they resumed normal diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the two countries have common
interests and a common wish to further the mutual friendship, and
that jointly safeguarding and developing this relationship will
have far-reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government and the
People's Liberation Army place great importance on Sino-Vietnamese
relations. We are willing to make a joint effort with Vietnam in
furthering friendly ties between the two countries and the two
armies," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Military relations have greatly improved in recent years, he
said, and they have agreed to have frequent contacts between the
leaders and the two armies to improve exchanges and
communications, he said. He hopes neighboring military commands
and border troops will increase their trust and friendship,
contacts, and cooperation so that border affairs can be properly
handled and the border can be built into a peaceful, quiet and
friendly area.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that the tense situation in South Asia was caused by
the nuclear arms race and that the "China threat" was merely made
up by some nations and is a rumor based on ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government was anxious and worried about the arms
race and urged the countries involved to show restraint and
immediately abandon the nuclear weapons development programs to
prevent further deterioration in the regional situation and to
keep peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Pham Van Tra said that Vietnam and China are both socialist
countries and that Vietnam places importance on its China ties and
that he is pleased to see the continued development of friendly
relations between the two countries. "Viet Nam will never forget
the sincere friendship and gigantic assistance given by the
Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, and the Chinese army
in our past struggle and economic construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the two countries' military ties
and said he hopes that exchanges between the headquarters of the
general staff, the general political departments, and other military
units will increase.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Guangkai, the PLA's deputy chief of general staff, Yuan
Shoufang, the deputy director of the PLA General Political
Department, and Li Junlian, deputy political commissar of PLA
naval forces attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations to Sell Zambia's Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations to sell Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines' Nchanga and Nkana mines between the
Zambian government and the Kafue Consortium finally collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The development follows the decision by the sole bidder's two
remaining members to abandon the project after "unfruitful
negotiations" with representatives of the Zambian government, The
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nchanga and Nkana are two biggest copper mines in Zambia which
account for 65 percent of the country's total copper production.
</P>
<P>
Both Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the initiator
of the consortium, and South Africa's Anglo Vall (AVMIN) Tuesday
resolved to abandon the mining project following 16-month long
negotiations with Zambia's privatisation team.
</P>
<P>
CDC and AVMIN had reopened negotiations with the mines
privatisation team two weeks ago after two other members of the
Kafue Consortium -- United States' Phelps Dodge and Canada-based
Noranda Incorporated -- pulled out of the project.
</P>
<P>
Phelps Dodge and Noranda announced on May 29 their withdrawal
from the project, citing unfruitful and delayed negotiations
which had dragged on for 15 months without even a memorandum of
understanding being signed.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's privatisation team earlier in March rejected a 105
million U.S. Dollars' cash offer for the mine and a five-year
re-capitalization of one billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian side viewed the cash offer as being "too low".
</P>
<P>
The Kafue Consortium, however, raised their cash offer for the
country's two largest mines to 131 million Dollars including a 35
million debt assumption. But the offer was also rejected,
prompting the pullout of Noranda and Phelps Dodge from the
project.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the negotiations currently left the Zambian
government with no alternative official bid from competing
investors except for unofficial expression of interest by
London-based Bycoon Lexmi Mittal and some Chinese corporations.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Drops to 12-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar sank to
a 12-year low in trading with the American dollar Wednesday
despite the concern from the Reserve Bank over the easing of
monetary conditions.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand dollar slid below the 50 U.S. cents mark,
closing at 0.4932, a level not seen since December 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank said Wednesday morning it was concerned about
the recent fall of the New Zealand dollar. But it did not say it
would take immediate actions to stop the currency's slide.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the bank was worried that a low New Zealand
dollar would push up the prices of imported goods such as petrol,
cars, clothing and factory machinery. Price rises would threaten
Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash's agreement with the government to
 keep inflation below 3 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
The slump in the New Zealand dollar has pushed up short-term
interest rates on the monetary market, with the 90-day bill rate
topping 10 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It also brought down the share market, which fell 1.5 percent
at the close Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Chief Calls for Consensus in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Commonwealth
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku has urged succession arrangements
in Nigeria to reflect genuine national consensus where the new
leadership is committed to programs aimed at restoring democracy
to the sprawling west African nation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Herald here Tuesday, Anyaoku said his
office was anxiously waiting for new Nigerian leader General
Abdusalam Abubakar's policy statement on the future of that
country, the daily newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar took over from former military strongman General Sani
Abacha who died of cardiac arrest in the Nigerian capital Abuja
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that all Nigerians would want to ensure that peace
prevails... We are all waiting to hear his statement on the
future program he has for his country," he said, adding that he
hopes it will be a "program that will return Nigeria speedily to
a democratically-elected government."
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said the new government should also have a program
that will lead to the release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Before his death Abacha had promised to hold elections on
August 1 as part of the process to return the country to civilian
rule.
</P>
<P>
"Given that Abubakar was in Abacha's government, we do not see
a problem of him carrying over from where his colleague left
off," Anyaoku said.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief said there would be no logical case for
the new leadership to ask for an extension of time before
democracy returns to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, he said, remained expelled from the Commonwealth and
will only be readmitted after a democratically-elected government
is put in place.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku was in Harare to consult with Zimbabwean Minister of
Finance Herbert Murerwa on the coming Ottawa meeting of the
Commonwealth ministers of finance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier he had been to Mozambique where he met President
Joaquim Chissano on developments in that country.

<HEADLINE> Local Chinese Officials Consulting Economists More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Some local Chinese officials and
entrepreneurs have discovered that economists can be useful in
solving problems as some recent lectures have shown.
</P>
<P>
Six economists and scholars from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and the Ministry of Agriculture aroused a great interest
over the past few days in the city of Changzhi in north China's
Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
They were invited by the local government to give three-hour
lectures each on topics like China's present economic situation,
agricultural industrialization, industrial restructuring, the
share holding system of businesses, and the government's role in a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Many of the local officials and entrepreneurs who attended the
lectures seemed to share the same view that awareness of the
country's macro-economic policies and present economic situation
could help them find practical solutions to various problems.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of the Chnagzhi City Committee of the Communist
Party of China, Yan Aiying, said that the event was a good way to
improve the quality of the work of the officials and entrepreneurs
and a way to help free them from old ideas and find new ways to
develop the economy.
</P>
<P>
China is going through a critical period of economic reforms,
and local officials and entrepreneurs are encountering various
problems in the process, which they hope can be solved with
theoretical guidance from knowledgeable people.
</P>
<P>
Jin Bei, a prominent economist from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, says that he has received invitations from many
places across China and has to use every weekend for the next
several months for these lectures.
</P>
<P>
Academic sources say that many prominent economists have been
invited to be economic advisors for local governments. Changzhi,
in fact, is preparing to establish an advisory relationship with
the Academy.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Blamed for Student Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government army is
held mostly responsible for the Monday massacre in which dozens
of students of Kichwamba National Technical Institute were burnt
to death, said a military source.
</P>
<P>
Charles Angina, second division army commander, was quoted by
Wednesday's New Vision daily as blaming the massacre on the
cowardice by the government army at the institute who he said
never put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
Angina said detachment commander Lieutenant Rajab Kasozi had
been arrested and would be sent to the martial court.
</P>
<P>
"Any sentence passed, be it hanging or firing squad, will be
done here in Kichwamba to show that the army takes seriously the
lives of the Ugandans," he told a mass rally in western Kabarole
district Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am disturbed by the fact that this commander was not
cooperative to the local community, that he was seen
communicating to suspected enemy forces. Maybe that's why he was
not even killed. He will face the army court," Angina added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a new commander had been posted to Kichwamba
and appealed to the masses to cooperate in fighting against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 to 300 rebels of the Allied Democratic Front attacked
the college at 5:30 a.m. Monday, burning student' dormitories and
making abductions, inviting accusing fingers from across the
country and putting security forces on full alert.

<HEADLINE> IMF Talking of Further Assistance to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said it is negotiating with the Zimbabwean government for
offering a concessional loan facility called the enhancement support
adjustment facility (ESAF) which may be made available next year.
</P>
<P>
IMF President Michael Camdessus, who is in Ouagadougou
attending the Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit, said in
an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency Tuesday that the soft
loan facility will enable the financial institution to provide on
a permanent pooling support for the country's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking soon after a meeting with Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe aside from the business of the OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
"I told the president that the IMF would like to help your
country and in view of the fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar and
impact on prices can provide support on the balance of payments
and foreign reserves which has already been approved," said
Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
He was talking about the stand facility approved which have
increased Zimbabwe's foreign reserves by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
"We now intend to help with the ESAF arrangement to assist in
the structural adjustment and the challenges of the government,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Camdessus addressed the African leaders during the
economic session of the OAU summit, during which he suggested the
way forward for most of Africa's struggling economies.
</P>
<P>
"Trade liberalisation needed to be boosted while regional
economic cooperation needed to be fostered, good governance and
frontal attack on structural problems needed to be done," he
noted.

The strikers also wanted the scrapping of a double system in

<HEADLINE> Peretz Reelected Israeli Trade Union Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's incumbent Histadrut
(Trade Union) leader Amir Peretz was reelected with a landslide
Tuesday, according to the final tally announced by Israel Radio
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The tally gave Peretz, a lawmaker from the leading opposition
Labor party, more than 77 percent of the votes, while his
challenger, Knesset (Parliament) member Maxim Levy, of the Gesher
Party, received only 22 percent. About half of the estimated
600,000 Histadrut members cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
This result was in line with that of the exit polls. After the
exit polls predicted a sweeping victory for him, Peretz, who
entered the election with a joint list with the ruling parties
Likud and Shas, celebrated in Tel Aviv Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the joint list had proved that one thing that
can unite Israelis is "honest livelihood."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Gesher-Meretz candidate, Levy, received the
predicted result Tuesday night with a grim face.
</P>
<P>
The election got off to a rocky start Tuesday when several
polling stations failed to open. Some officials reported that
voting slips were missing and the parties accused each other of
fraud.
</P>
<P>
It was the first election victory for Peretz, who inherited his
position from Labor lawmaker Haim Ramon. The triumph is believed
to establish him as a prominent political figure, as well as a
leader of the nation's workers.
</P>
<P>
Under the name of the Histadrut, Peretz has launched several
countrywide labor strikes since the Likud-led coalition came to
power in 1996 to protest the government's belt-tightening policy
that drastically cut the workers' pension and other welfare
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut holds elections every four years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine to Address Food Shortage in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
constituted a transition food plan for southern Mindanao to
address its food problem, which has affected more than 800,000
families or 2 million people in 10 provinces there.
</P>
<P>
In a report sent to President Fidel Ramos, acting Presidential
Management Staff chief Demetrio Ignacio said Wednesday that a
multi-agency meeting was held to discuss the short- and long-term
strategies to attend to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Ignacio said the meeting agreed to continue supplying food to
120,000 families still suffering food shortages until August 1998
in Mindanao as one of the short-term measures.
</P>
<P>
The other short-term measures include providing loan and
subsidy to some 140,000 families to purchase rice.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed to improve agricultural productivity as its
long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
Under this strategy, the Department of Agriculture will improve
irrigation facilities and provide good quality seeds and
fertilizers to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 famine-related deaths have reported in Mindanao
since January 1998 when the massive food shortage began to hit the
region.

<HEADLINE> Inspectors Being Sent To Look At Finances Of State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one-year-old Liu Deguang
received a letter this morning from Song Jidong, the mayor of the
city of Liuzhou in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
appointing him chief financial inspector of a state business.
</P>
<P>
This was the opening move in the region's decision to send
financial inspectors to large state-owned enterprises to control
the use of state assets, finances, and accounting, and to behave
as goverment property owners.
</P>
<P>
Seven other inspectors joined Liu in the work. The chief
financial inspector is a new phenomenon, Liu says, so he wants to
make a greater effort and to be better educated, to do a better
job.
</P>
<P>
The eight enterprises involved say they welcome the idea. "The
chief financial inspectors will help straighten out financial
affairs, and help enterprises avoid making mistakes in investment,
decision-making, and capital use, and will help prevent
corruption. They supervise and provide services at the same time,
so we need them badly," says Li Ziming, chairman of Liuzhou's
Yufeng Cement Group Co. Ltd., where Liu was sent.
</P>
<P>
The city's state-owned enterprises have more than 20 billion
yuan in assets, so sending finance inspectors there is a major
step by the city government to reform the state sector, Song,
the mayor of Liuzhou, comments.

COLOMBO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is building new water
supply pipes for 50,000 urban and rural families this year at an
estimated cost of 46.9 million U.S. dollars, sources at the
National Water Supply and Drainage Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said 280 water supply schemes are being implemented

<HEADLINE> Competition In China's Hotel Business Getting Fiercer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- As the competition gets more
intense in China, profit margins, room occupancy rates, and
productivity of Chinese tourism hotels drops, the overseas edition
of today's People's Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
A hotel construction boom that began in 1994 has resulted in
4,500 tourism hotels, many built with foreign funds. But, while
this growth kept abreast of the growing tourism, it also led to
room surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The office building boom, many of them located in downtown or
economically-important areas, has further intensified the
competition. By the beginning of this year, there was 2.5 million
square meters of new office space in Beijing, taking up half the
tourist hotel area of the city.
</P>
<P>
The oversupply is partly blamed on the hotel approval system,
under which the people involved in tourism in China have no say in
most of the tourist hotel projects.
</P>
<P>
In practice, the China National Tourism Administration is only
responsible for approving hotels with foreign funding. Just over
600 of the hotels now in existence were authorized by the
Administration, while the other 4,000 were approved by offices
outside the tourism business.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Military Reintegration Talks Fail Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The second round of
negotiations to reintegrate armed resistance forces loyal to
deposed first prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh into the
government army failed Wednesday over a row on procedure.
</P>
<P>
The delegation loyal to Ranariddh insisted that firstly they
should talk about the ceasefire, then the pardoning of the
generals sentenced by Cambodian Military Court, including General
Nhiek Bun Chhay, and then the troop's reintegration.
</P>
<P>
But government negotiation team refused to talk about anything
else except the troop's integration.
</P>
<P>
General Hun Pheoung, chief of the resistance forces'
negotiation team, alleged that the government forces broke a
Japanese-sponsored ceasefire last month by attacking the
resistance stronghold of O'Smach on the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
"If they do not stop immediately, we will never have any faith
in these talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
The allegations were denied by government. Instead, General Dom
Vuthy, chief of the government's negotiation team, accused
resistance forces of trying to seek excuse to delay and refuse
handover of their forces to the government.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks broke down after only ten minutes on
May 15, when government negotiators complained that two civilians
were among resistance negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The new five-member negotiation team of resistance forces led
by General Hun Pheoung are all military men.

<HEADLINE> Cut Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Compaq and Dell, two leading
computer makers of the United States, have introduced new lines of
powerful workstations and corporate computers, and cut the prices
of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
Compaq's AP400, one of its powerful and yet inexpensive new
lines, is the company's first workstation to use Intel's new 350-
and 400-MHz Pentium II processors and "bus" technology which
allows the processor to communicate with other components at high
speed.
</P>
<P>
Dell has also introduced two new lines in the OptiPlex family,
with a view to refining its strategy for corporate desktop PCs.
</P>
<P>
These workstations are targeted for use in "mainstream"
applications such as computer-aided design or Web content creation.
</P>
<P>
Compaq says it has cut prices of the existing line
of professional workstations up to 28 percent and the model 6000
workstations have price cuts of up to 20 percent. Upgrades for
dual processor systems also have price cuts of up to 27 percent
and are available starting at 795 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most recent round of price cuts comes as the company tries
to reduce bloated inventory levels that severely hurt its earnings
of the first quarter of 1998 .
</P>
<P>
Dell has been less affected by inventory woes affecting the
rest of the industry. But it has also cut its average selling
prices by 10 percent in the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
One of Dell's new OptiPlex family, the E1, is the company's
first product based on Celeron, the Intel processor for "basic"
computing. Dell's three new systems with Celeron and Pentium II,
marketed between this week and mid-July, are priced at 1,326,
1,963 and 2,750 dollars respectively.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Former State Chief Minister Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former Selangor
state chief minister Muhammad Haji Muhamad Taib was charged at the
Sessions Court here Wednesday with failing to declare his and his
family's assets last year.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with committing the offense on May 26 last year
under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, accompanied by his wife Asbi Rohani Asnan and other
family members, appeared calm when the charge against him was read
out.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, who was acquitted last May 29 by Australia's Brisbane
District Court of two charges of making a false declaration
pertaining to the amount of money he was bringing into Australia
on December 16, 1996 and failure to declare 1.26 million
Australian dollars (about 2.9 million ringgit or 0.75 million U.S.
dollars) when he was leaving for New Zealand six days later,
pleaded not guilty at the Sessions Court here.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad's case will be heard Wednesday afternoon at the High
Court here after the Sessions Court allowed a prosecution request
to commute the case to the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mohamad K. Abdul Rahman also allowed Muhammad a bond of
10,000 ringgit (about 2,500 U.S. dollars) without surety to ensure
Muhammad's presence at the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, 53, is charged with knowingly ignoring conditions in
a statutory declaration dated May 23, 1997 by only declaring
assets worth, at the time of acquisition, 10.82 million ringgit
(about 2.705 million U.S. dollars or 3.46 million Australian
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Public Prosecutor had required Muhammad to declare one by
one all movable and immovable assets belonging to him or owned by
his agents or trustees, wife and children.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have committed the offense at the office of
the Deputy Public Prosecutor at the Anti-Corruption Agency
headquarters in Pesiaran Duta here on May 26 last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Act, Muhammad faces a maximum sentence of one year
imprisonment or a fine of 2,000 ringgit (about 250 U.S. dollars)
or both upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad resigned as chief minister following the Australian
court case and last Monday the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) Supreme Council extended Muhammad's leave as
the party vice-president.
</P>
<P>
During the trial at the Brisbane District Court, Muhammad said
that he had purchased properties valued at more than 10.4 million
ringgit (about 2.6 million U.S. dollars) in Australia and New
Zealand under the name of his wife Asbi Rohani Asnan.

over its own nuclear protection, promised by the five nuclear
nations, if India and Pakistan are accepted as world nuclear
powers.
</P>
<P>
This possibility of a policy change was stated on June 6 by the
Ukrainian representative to the United Nations, Vladimir Yelchenko.
</P>
<P>
He made the point at the U.N. Security Council's meeting on the
situation after the detonation of nuclear weapons by India and
Pakistan, an official from the Ukraine Foreign Ministry told a
press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If the nuclear race in South Asia continued in an escalating
manner, Ukraine would reserve its right to re-open talks with the
five recognized nuclear powers, Director of the Press Bureau
Viktor Nagaichuk quoted Yelchenko as saying.
</P>
<P>
After its independence in 1992, Ukraine inherited all the
nuclear weapons left over in its territory by the former Soviet
Union, and actually became the third biggest nuclear power at the
time.
</P>
<P>
In January 1994, Ukraine signed a treaty with Russia and the
United States, agreeing to send all its nuclear weapons to Russia
and have them destroyed there.
</P>
<P>
Upon the signing of the treaty, the five existing nuclear
nations each announced their nuclear protection for Ukraine, who
later also became a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Becomes First Latin American Country to Chart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombia has become the
first Latin American country to produce a chart of hydroclimatic
risks.
</P>
<P>
The chart, which indicates risks from climatic changes ranging
from drought to flood, in various regions, will contribute to good
harvests in the country, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The chartered map was based on the survey and research of
natural disasters which frequently haunt the country by experts
employed by the Agrarian Administration, its president, Sigifredo
Ardila, said.
</P>
<P>
The chart is composed of four volumes. The first, which went
into use last Saturday, covers the Caribbean area. The other
three regions of the country will be available to the public free
within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the United States are the only other countries in
the whole of the American continents to have utilized this system
to reduce agrarian risks, said Ardila.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the chart, Colombian farmers can plan their
crop seasons more precisely and achieve better economic results,
said Ardila.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Rate on Rise in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of cancer has doubled
in the past 15 years in Bulgaria, with a total of 26,000 cases of
malignant tumors diagnosed each year.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 are women diagnosed with breast cancer, an average
of nine each day in a country of around 8.4 million, said
Associate Professor Samuel Danon, head of National Register for
Cancer Diseases, as he commented on the results of a research
program, Data on Breast Cancer Prophylaxis, in Veliko Turnovo,
northern Bulgaria, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics put the number of patients hospitalized with
cancer at 180,000 in Bulgaria, Danon said.
</P>
<P>
Half of the women diagnosed with breast cancer die due to
belated diagnosis. Only 63 percent of breast cancer cases are
diagnosed in the initial stages, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than one million women throughout the
world die of breast cancer a year.
</P>
<P>
Prophylactic examinations and free consultations for women from
Veliko Turnovo are planned for the next three weeks. Breast cancer
prophylaxis is part a program on healthy living which is operating
for a third consecutive year in the region.

<HEADLINE> Two New Lots of Loans to Be Auctioned in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two new lots of hire-purchase
loans of Thailand's 56 closed finance companies will be auctioned
along with seven previously announced ones, the Bangkok Post
Wednesday reported.
</P>
<P>
With the two new lots, worth 5.7 billion baht (132.6 million
U.S. dollars), the first sale of the core assets of the 56
companies contains virtually all the hire-purchase assets of the
companies, Financial Restructuring Authority (FRA) Chairman Amaret
Sila-On said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The nine lots comprise 336,973 auto hire-purchase loans with a
total outstanding balance of about 51.7 billion baht (1.2 billion
dollars), Amaret said.
</P>
<P>
The FRA had earlier planned to begin the core-assets auction on
June 18, but had to postpone for one week due to heavy interest
shown by investors.
</P>
<P>
After the hire-purchase loans auction, the FRA is expected to
put mortgage loans under hammer.
</P>
<P>
The FRA said it hopes to start auctioning off 5,000-6,000
mortgage loans worth 25 billion baht (581 million dollars) by
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Asset quality for the mortgage loans portfolio was good, with
non-performing loans accounting for less than 10 percent of the
total, the authority said.
</P>
<P>
The FRA also announced Tuesday that a limited number of
vehicles would be available for auction starting at 50,000 baht
(1,162 dollars) each on June 19.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Oil, Gas Sector Grows in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's crude oil and natural gas
 sector, which draws the largest share of foreign investment, grew
by 37.7 percent in the fiscal 1997-98 ended March, according to
the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The production of crude oil increased to 6.1 million barrels
from 3.8 million barrels in the 1996-97 fiscal year, said a latest
official report on Myanmar's financial, economic and social
conditions issued by the Ministry of National Planning and
Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
The output of natural gas rose to 68,540 million cubic-feet
(1,940 million cubic-meter) from 58,579 million cubic-feet (1,658
million cubic-meter) in the previous year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report added that in the 1997-98 fiscal year, Myanmar was
able to drill more gas wells in the newly-developed Kyaukhwet and
Letpando oil fields, and boost production of old ones such as
Chauk, Yenangyaung and Mann.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year, Myanmar was also able to complete the
laying of pipelines to prepare for the planned sale of natural gas
to Thailand later this year from the Yadana gas field in the gulf
of Mottama.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is striving to increase the production of oil and gas
to meet its domestic demand as well as to increase export by
boosting the output of old gas wells and extensively drilling more
new ones.
</P>
<P>
To help achieve the aim, the country has been undertaking joint
exploration and production of oil and gas with a number of foreign
businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, investments in the oil and
gas sector from companies of Australia, Britain, France,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States were
nearly 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 45 related projects at the end
of February this year, making up the largest part in the country's
7 billion dollar total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show the country's economy achieved a
growth rate of 4.6 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal year. The average
annual growth rate in the previous five years (1992-93 to 1996-97)
was 7.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Moorer Refuses Confirmation of Nerve Gas in Laos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A former chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Thomas Moorer, said Tuesday he did not know
that sarin nerve gas was used by the American troops during the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
He denied that he confirmed its use to CNN television, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Moorer, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during
the Vietnam War, said he had simply heard unconfirmed rumors that
the toxic gas was used by U.S. Special Forces units, including in
a 1970 operation in Laos which is now under review by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the authority to release the use of (sarin) gas
and I, of course, have never seen an operation order or battle
report or anything" referring to the use of the nerve agent,
Moorer told the AP.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Moorer as saying he couldn't entirely
discount the possibility that sarin gas was used by Special Forces.
</P>
<P>
"There were rumors that this gas had been used. But I tell
everybody, if they want to know, I don't know that they used it.
I don't know that they didn't use it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CNN and Time Magazine reported Sunday, after an
eight-months investigation and interviews with hundreds of Vietnam
War-era U.S. military officials and soldiers, including Moorer,
that U.S. troops used sarin gas during Operation Tailwind in Laos,
and other missions.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. defectors were supposedly killed in Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
Despite Moorer's denial of confirmation, the CNN said Tuesday
that it stood by its story.
</P>
<P>
"Two hundred interviews and eight months of research, including
the statement of Admiral Moorer, leads us to absolutely believe in
the truthfulness of the story," said Steve Haworth, a vice
president of news at the CNN's Atlanta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"Our story does not completely and solely depend on Admiral
Moorer, but Admiral Moorer certainly does support our story and in
no way contradicts our story."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered an
investigation into the allegations.

<HEADLINE> China Having to Adjust Its Grain Production (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's wheat supplies are sufficient, but a considerable
amount is still imported. But, as a senior executive of Beijing
Hengtong Food Co. Ltd. puts it, "It's not that we can't buy wheat
in China, it's just that the variety of home-grown wheat is
limited and does not meet our specific demands." Hengtong is a big
producer of flour products, which imports 20,000 to 40,000 tons of
wheat annually.
</P>
<P>
"Some 70 percent of the bread, cakes, and biscuits sold in
Beijing's restaurants and shopping malls are made from imported
wheat," he says.
</P>
<P>
Importing wheat is not an unusual practice in China, because
other types of grain like malting barley are also imported,
according to a China National Liangfeng Grain Import &AMP; Export
Corp. official.
</P>
<P>
In addition to problems coming from the irrational planting of
grain, the marketing system also produces sales problems.
According to a State Development Planning Commission official, the
existing grain distribution system has become less and less suited
to the nation's grain production and to changes in supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
The good news however, is that both the Chinese government and
farmers have come to realize the importance of grain production
and marketing. Premier Zhu Rongji has called for immediate reforms
in the nation's grain marketing system, to bring a new era of
grain production.
</P>
<P>
In this system, farmers would sign contracts with grain dealers
instead of relying on the government, and would only grow the
grain they could plant and sell. Again, Hubei is an example.
Farmers there have reduced the amount of rice acreage and
increased the amount used for corns, beans, and peanuts this year.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders say that these grain sales problems will
really be solved once the market laws are obeyed.

BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of tapioca rose
by 49.24 percent to 9.64 billion baht (224 million U.S. dollars)

reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Foreign Trade Department,
the volume of tapioca exports fell by 9.05 percent to 1.62 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The value of tapioca pellet exports in the same period
increased by 30.55 percent to 4.95 billion baht (115 million

Meanwhile, tapioca flour exports reached 360,000 tons worth
4.68 billion baht (109 million dollars), a rise of 11.97 percent
and 75.88 percent respectively during the first four months of
1998 compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the 1997-98 output by 16.92 percent to 14.68
million tons from that of the previous year has led to a price

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank to Strengthen Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank has
decided to take steps to strengthen small and medium-scale
businesses in the country, The Jakarta Post Wednesday quoted a top
official of the central bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
Miranda Gultom, director of the central bank, Bank Indonesia
(BI), said that the central bank would boost its contribution of
total supply of subsidized credit to 100 percent from 65 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 35 percent of last year's subsidized credit was
previously contributed by the country's commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's January 1990 deregulation package, the
central bank's role in providing subsidized credit to small and
medium-scale businesses was to be reduced gradually and replaced
by the increasing role of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"But it is unrealistic to expect such a thing at the moment,"
Miranda said.
</P>
<P>
She explained that it was impossible for commercial banks to
provide subsidized credit at an interest rate of 16 percent, while
they had to raise funds with an interest rate of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's banking system is currently at its lowest point,
battered by the monetary crisis, mounting bad debt and poor
management.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BI said in a statement published Tuesday that its
net claims on the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA)
jumped to 132.12 trillion rupiah (11.49 billion U.S. dollars) on
June 5 from 124.63 trillion rupiah (10.84 billion dollars) the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly caused by a rise in liquidity
injections into troubled banks being supervised by IBRA, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the central bank's net
international reserves on June 5 were reported at 14.62 billion
dollars, 8.4 million dollars less than on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, the statement said, the net international
reserves figure is still above the minimum level allowed by the
International Monetary Fund. But the central bank did not mention
the limit.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Tuesday mounted a fierce
attack on the residence of district member of Parliament
Vaithiyalingam Balachandran in Vavuniya in Northern province.
</P>
<P>
Balachandran belongs to the Peoples Liberation Organization of
Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), a party now in the mainstream of politics and
a rival to the LTTE, reports reaching here from the north said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the attack, a police sentry on duty was killed. Balachandran
was at home at the time of the raid but escaped unhurt through the
back door with his wife, five children and his mother.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who had arrived in a hijacked vehicle, used
automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades in the attack.
Extensive damage was caused to the MP's house. The rebels also
removed the MP's vehicle which was later found abandoned a few
miles away.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that a joint police-army operation has been
launched to trace the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the government for a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country since
1983.

<HEADLINE> China Having To Adjust Its Grain Production(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- After several successful harvests,
Chinese farmers are finding it difficult to sell their grain and
evidence points to the fact that China is shifting from a seller's
market to the buyer's.
</P>
<P>
This has prompted the Chinese government to put adjusting grain
production high on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, the central
government's top concern has been increasing grain output to feed
the largest population in the world. But, the emphasis on quantity
instead of quality, coupled with the centrally-controlled grain
distribution system had a negative effect on the nation's grain
production.
</P>
<P>
Farmers of Hubei Province, a major grain producer in central
China, for example, had 48.6 percent more surplus grain per capita
last year than in 1996, but per capita income from grain was 73
yuan (8.7 US dollars) less simply because they couldn't sell their
grain. To make matters worse, this dampenned farmers' enthusiasm
for growing grain somewhat, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
In spite of repeated grain harvests, China's per capita grain
output still stands at less than 400 kg. The major problem in grain
sales lies in severed link between production and marketing,
according to some economists.
</P>
<P>
Grain demand has changed considerably, they point out, and
consumers no longer rely solely on rice, corn, and wheat, but have
turned instead to a greater variety of foods like meat, fruits,
and other flour products.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Endorses Partial Thai Airways Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has endorsed the
partial privatization of the national flag-carrier Thai Airways
International proposed by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the ministry will sell 380 million shares
of the airways, comprising the 280 million shares that it already
owns and 100 million new shares, today's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will retain a 67.99 percent stake in the airways
after the sale. With the three percent stake held by the Thai
private sector, the sale will be in line with the Civil Aviation
Act requiring the state to maintain control of not less than 70
percent of the airline.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet has approved in principle the sale of the shares,
but has not yet decided on how to sell the shares and the prices,"
Supachai Pisitvanich, the ministry's permanent secretary, said
after the regular weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also endorsed the appointment of a committee headed
by Supachai to hire a consultant firm to underwrite the shares of
the airways.
</P>
<P>
A government source said the next step would be to reduce the
stake of the state to 50 percent so as to provide an incentive for
foreign investors to take part.
</P>
<P>
The source said the Finance Ministry expects to sell most of
the shares to foreign strategic partners such as the Star Alliance
to enable Thai Airways International to benefit from their
aviation know-how. The Star Alliance members include Air Canada,
Lufthansa and Thai Airways International.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government, confronted by a devastating economic
crisis which began with the float of the baht last July, is
committed to the partial privatization of several state
enterprises.

Tensions in Kosovo mounted on March 1 after an armed conflict
which led to the deaths of four policemen and 16 Albanians. At
least 250 people were killed in later clashes between Serb forces
and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- At least three suspected Muslim
rebels were killed Tuesday as fighting between guerrillas of the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and government forces
continued in a southern Philippine province.
</P>
<P>
In a report published Wednesday, the military said suspected
rebels also killed four persons and wounded 12 others in a raid
late Monday in Ipil town in the same province, Zamboanga del Sur.
</P>
<P>
Government soldiers have overrun a training camp of Muslim
rebels in the town of Tungawan, several kilometers from Ipil, a
predominantly Christian town.
</P>
<P>
The military offensive, which started June 4, is aimed at
flushing out about 200 MILF fighters believed to be behind a
series of highway robberies and extortion activities in the
Zamboanga Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Horacio Lapinid, chief of the Southern Command Public
Relation Office, said suspected rebels lobbed homemade bombs and
strafed houses in Ipil town to ease military pressure in
neighboring Tungawan town.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which already signed a peace treaty with
the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF refused to be included in the peace treaty but is
negotiating with the government for a similar peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Turning to Intensive Agriculture in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Chongqing, who used
to rely on expanding their farmland for grain harvests, now have
learned to increase their output through scientific methods.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing in southwest China has the largest rural population
and farmland among the four municipalities directly under the
central government. However, its per capita output has been
decreasing in recent years as its population increased.
</P>
<P>
As a result, traditional farming patterns reached an
impasse. Some farmers have turned to scientific agricultural
methods and reaped better harvests on the same tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
An application of better quality seeds is one of the farmers'
favorite choices. Liu Xueping, a farmer in Shizhu County, said
that his high-yield, oil-rich corn not only survived this year's
severe drought but also outgrew all other corn crops.
</P>
<P>
By using plastic film, farmers now harvest more than 6,000 kg
of maize per hectare, compared with 3,000 kg by traditional
methods. However, the oil-rich variety of maize can yield 10
percent more in output than other varieties relying on plastic
sheeting, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
More and more farmers like Liu are becoming better off by
 introducing advanced agro-technology. The city's per capita
farmland amounts to less than one-15th hectare, but its per
hectare yield has more than doubled because of the widespread use
of scientific farming methods, which have now become the major
means for higher grain output, according to Gu Wenyu, deputy
director of the city's Agriculture Department.

year ago to only 2,951 units, according to the latest statistics
from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines

</P>
<P>
In a report published Wednesday, the chamber said car sales

</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month basis, sales in May saw another 4 percent
decline from April sales of 3,075 units.
</P>
<P>
The chamber said passenger car sales continued to be adversely
affected by higher prices due to the devalued peso, increased
financing charges and slow and selective approval of retail
financing applications.
</P>
<P>
Honda Cars Philippines Inc. regained its leadership in the
passenger car market in May, with its sales reaching a hefty 1,190

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Retracts Pro-Imelda Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' new chief
government lawyer has asked the Supreme Court to let stand a
12-year jail sentence on former first lady Imelda Marcos for
corruption, the newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Solicitor General Silvestre Bello on
Tuesday withdrew a petition filed last week by his predecessor,
Romeo de la Cruz, which had sought Imelda Marcos' acquittal on
corruption charges on the ground that she had been erroneously
convicted.
</P>
<P>
De la Cruz was fired by President Ramos two days after he filed
the controversial petition to the Supreme Court. Bello, who is
also justice secretary, was appointed to replace de la Cruz.
</P>
<P>
A special anti-graft court in 1993 convicted Imelda Marcos,
widow of former president Ferdinand Marcos, of corruption in
connection with a real estate deal in which the government
allegedly lost money, and sentenced her to up to 24 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
She appealed the verdict before the Supreme Court, which upheld
the conviction but lowered the punishment to 12 years
imprisonment. But Imelda Marcos, 68, remains free on a second
appeal.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Use Internet To Shop For Hollywood Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- This past Monday, China opened a
Website on the Internet that it can use to place orders for
Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
The site is on Chinacue, the Internet designation for art
topics, which will be used by the Hollywood Classics Co. Ltd. The
first group of movies will be new ones from the 1990s and some
1940s classics.
</P>
<P>
The site also provides information about movies and shows not
currently available. But some Chinese surfers have been already
watching Western movies with the help of the site known as Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
Several European companies will also enter the Chinese market
through the new site, providing copyrights to Chinese film and TV
producers.
</P>
<P>
The new Website was set up by the China Federation of Literary
and Art Circles and the Beijing Telegraph Bureau and is the best
place for Chinese and foreign artists to share their views and a
place for Chinese to learn about more things from abroad,
according to the Federation's Shao Mujun.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the Website is the effect of the combination
of a market economy and technology, and China's opening up. The
commercialization of culture is now common in China, and
money-losing state film studios and artists and publishers are all
urging that an easy information channel be created.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Sun Jiazheng says that contacts with
foreigners should be increased because culture has become a
popular means of improving Sino-foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the Internet will have a complicated and
profound impact on culture. But, Chinese artists and writers are
new to the electronic age, especially when compared with the
fields of commerce, education, and science, and the number of
Internet users is small.
</P>
<P>
One commentator, Yan Peng, says, "There are no walls on the
Internet. We are therefore more directly, quickly and widely faced

<P>
XI'AN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Shaanxi Province will move
its people living in poverty in three years to give them better
living conditions, provincial government sources say.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi still has nearly 2 million people living below the
poverty line, a quarter of a million of them with special
difficulties because of geographical conditions.
</P>
<P>
The local government had made an effort to help the extremely
poor in recent years, but many of them suffering from disease and
other troubles still have food and clothing problems. So the
government has decided to move them to better places.
</P>
<P>
Farmers will be allowed to decide whether or not to move, or
they can move elsewhere but return to their original place within
three years. The government will also sign contracts with farmers
to safeguard their rights.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement program, which has already been used on a
trial basis, has been successful in helping more than 20,000
people, so the province plans to resettle another 70,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wei, Shaanxi's deputy governor, has also signed
responsibility agreements with local officials to insure success
of the program.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Gansu Province and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
have given at least 700,000 people a better living standard
through similar efforts.

<HEADLINE> Kodak-Financed Project Starts Construction in Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a
365-million-U.S. dollar photographic production plant, financed by
Eastman Kodak Company of the United States, began Tuesday in
Xiamen, a port city in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The plant, located in the Haicang Investment and Development
Zone, will have an area of 430,000 sq m and produce sensitive
emulsions, color films and photographic paper for all purposes.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be built in two stages, will begin production of
photographic paper in mid-1999 and will start producing films by
the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
George Fisher, Kodak chairman and chief executive officer, who
presided over yesterday's ground-breaking ceremony for the new
plant, said the Haicang project would become one of Kodak's
largest production plants in the world.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a deal struck earlier this year between
Eastman Kodak Company, the world leader in imaging, and the
Chinese Government. Under the agreement, the American partner will
invest one billion U.S. dollars in building a first-rate
photographic industry in China in cooperation with Chinese
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The investment will be used to increase Kodak's production
capacity in China, establish distribution networks, conduct
marketing activities, and assist technology upgrading of its local
imaging partners.
</P>
<P>
In late March, two other joint ventures -- Kodak-controlled
Chinese limited-liability companies of Kodak (China) Company
Ltd. and Kodak (Wuxi) Company Ltd -- were launched in Shanghai,
and in Wuxi of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Kodak estimates, China will become the largest
market for imaging products by 2010 or earlier. Three years ago,
China ranked the 17th largest market for Kodak, and it moved into
second place last year.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Machine Tools Group Striving to Increase Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Dalian Machine
Tools Group tried hard to overcome adverse effect of the financial
crisis inflicting East Asia by expanding international market and
achieved success marked by a sharp rise of 36.3 percent in exports
in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Previously, most of the conglomerate's exported commodities
were meant for Southeast Asia, but the financial crisis, which
first occurred in Southeast Asia late last year and has soon
spilled over to East Asia, made the Dalian group suffer a drop of
60 percent in its exports in three quarters of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the first three months of this year, the Dalian
group has received no orders from Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
To counter this situation, Dalian Machine Tools Group adjusted
its overseas marketing strategy and concentrated more efforts on
opening up new international market.
</P>
<P>
While increasing research on market demands and potential
competitors, the Dalian group has set up business offices or
marketing agent offices in places including South Africa, the
United States, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It has also adjusted product mix according to market demands
and practiced a wide range of measures to improve enterprise
recognition and improve capacity to react to market changes.
</P>
<P>
So far, sales volume of the group's export commodities to the
United States exceeded 120,481 U.S. dollars in the first quarter,
while sales volume of the group's export products to South
America surpassed 216,867 U.S. dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Machine Tools Group delivered 41 million yuan (one
U.S. dollar equals to 8.3 yuan) worth of commodities for exports
in 1997.

CARACAS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- About 160,000 public school
teachers in Venezuela started a 48-hour strike on Tuesday after
the Education Ministry failed to settle a payment debt with their
union.
</P>

The Teachers Association said the government owed 150 billion
bolivars (278 million U.S. dollars) to public school teachers,
including bonus back pay and geographic benefits for those working

The Education Ministry acknowledged a debt of only 29 billion

July.
</P>
<P>
The strike will leave four million students in public schools
across the country without classes for two days.

overcoming the adverse conditions and extreme poverty which still
scourge many countries.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Brazil and Argentina urged the international
community and all countries to adopt urgent measures to eliminate
nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Military Interference Be Considered in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday that all options including U.S. military interference
should be considered to avoid what he called a "human carnage" in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks at a White House news conference with
visiting South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that I am determined to do all that I can to
stop a repeat of the human carnage in Bosnia and the ethnic
cleansing," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he had authorized an accelerated planning process
for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Clinton
stressed: "We do not believe any options should be taken off the
table."
</P>
<P>
He also pledged his support for a U.N. resolution proposed by
Britain that would commit the big powers to "use all necessary
means" to try to stop the escalating conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are supporting and working with the British to get the
strongest possible resolution through the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to work out the wording of the resolution.
But we have no dispute over the phrase that you have focused on,
which is to use "all necessary means" to try to avoid ethnic
cleansing and the loss of human life," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, State Department spokesman James Rubin said
that no decisions had been taken so far on any military action.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the Contact Group on the former
Yugoslavia, made up of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and
the United States, will meet in London on Friday to discuss the
Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> China Urges All Villages to Embrace Democracy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The circular states that promoting the open management of
village affairs is intended to enable the broad masses of the
farmers to participate in village management and closely watch the
performance of the leadership they have elected.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, all major issues of public concerns and any
practical problems that will have an impact on the farmers'
personal interests must be made public to the villagers instead of
being decided or resolved secretly," the circular states.
</P>
<P>
These issues mainly include new economic projects, village
assets, income and expenditures, land leases and house-building
permits, birth control, and the distribution of relief funds and
materials as well as salaries, bonuses and performance records of
village officials.
</P>
<P>
"Each village must set up a special billboard for publicizing
the details of all major village affairs, and the interval between
two open reports should be no longer than three months," the
circular adds.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that it is of critical importance for
building democracy in the rural areas to establish a villagers'
congress, which is formed either by the entire village or the
villagers' representatives.
</P>
<P>
"The villagers' congress will carry out democratic consultation
on major issues in village management, and the final decision
must be made in accordance with the majority opinion," says the
circular. "The wrong practice that a few officials act wilfully
regardless of the villagers' wishes must be corrected resolutely."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it says, the villagers' congress should be granted
the power to make an annual appraisal on the work of the
villagers' committee, and any leadership that fails to satisfy the
villagers must be reshuffled.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Retransmission hke -- Former U.S. Secretary of State on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illustrative of the steps taken to realize a "strategic
partnership" is the establishment of a direct telephone "hot" line
between the two governments, Haig said.
</P>
<P>
This telephone link enables the leaders of both countries to
establish a dialogue on critical issues in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
This important new link was first used by President Jiang and
President Clinton last month to explore diplomatic means for
defusing the crisis between Indian and Pakistan, the general said.
</P>
<P>
Since the summit, Haig continued, the defense establishments of
the U.S. and China have initiated an official consultation
mechanism for an exchange of views on international and regional
security issues, including the strengthening of military safety at
sea, by avoiding accidents and misunderstandings that could lead
to improper decisions.
</P>
<P>
"The increases in high level military exchanges between the
countries, as with high level dialogues on political and economic
issues, represent the essence of a 'constructive strategic
partnership,' " he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about how to enhance cooperation while
seeking common ground in areas of differences, Haig said that
frequent high level exchanges between the leaders of China and
the United States are the most important steps that can be taken.
</P>
<P>
"We need to better understand each other in order to find
common ground on issues where historical realities might have
created differences," he said. "Differences cannot be simply
shunted aside in the interest of diplomatic harmony."
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that great nations have their own national
interests which may clash with the interests of other great
nations, Haig said. "However, these differences can often be
managed if addressed prudently in an open-minded and cordial
fashion."
</P>
<P>
"I often think back on the differences that divided us in the
early 1970s. In less than 30 years, consider how far we have come
in addressing differences through communications and enhanced
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Asked how to increase mutual understanding, Haig said, "I've
never believed that respect was lacking between the Chinese and
American peoples. In fact, the Chinese enjoy the high regard and
admiration of the American people."
</P>
<P>
But, admittedly, there are politicians and leaders representing
narrow special interest groups whose careers have been built by
adopting anti-China rhetorical themes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Misinformation and misunderstandings on the part of individuals
from both countries and from third countries as well need to be
worked on, he added.
</P>
<P>
Progress is achieved through more contacts between peoples, by
visits of Chinese to the United States, Americans to China, by
student exchanges, educational exchanges and by increased
communications with opinion leaders who might unknowingly be
spreading misinformation and half truths, he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Our leaders also need to do a better job in explaining why a
strong, positive U.S.-China relationship is in the interest of not
only China and the U.S., but of the world at large."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Sino-U.S. relationship's impact on regional and
global issues, the general said the positive effects of a
strengthened U.S.-China relationship have been evident on numerous
issues since the two presidents met in October 1997 in Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States have taken leadership roles in
shoring up the economies of several of the Asian countries that
teetered on collapse.
</P>
<P>
"China's unilateral action in aiding the government of Thailand
last year and China's refraining from currency devaluation despite
market pressures have earned great respect.
</P>
<P>
"Just as the U.S. through the International Monetary Fund
sought to shore up the economies of several Asian countries, so
too has China taken the lead in demonstrating its sense of
responsibility as a stabilizing force in the global economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Affirmation of the positive effect of a strengthened U.S.-China
relationship is no more evident than in the cooperation shown
between President Clinton and President Jiang in seeking to
strengthen stability on the South Asian subcontinent following
independent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, Haig said.
</P>
<P>
Haig expressed the view that as the world looks to China and
the U.S. for leadership through the Clinton-Jiang Summit in
Beijing later this month, people should bear in mind the dividends
of peace and stability and unprecedented economic growth that have
been made possible by the strengthened U.S. China relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Steel Tube Company of Baoshan
Iron and Steel Group has received orders from Trans-Texas Gas
Company of the United States for making 500 tons of drill rods for
the latter company.
</P>
<P>
The rods will soon be shipped to the U.S. soon. It is the first
time for the Shanghai-based company to export drill rods to the
United States, said a company executive.
</P>
<P>
Before this, the Shanghai company shipped 250 tons of drill
rods (type G-105) to the United States, which had been used by the
U.S. company to drill a 5,091.16-m-deep oil well in Houston, said
Alan Drane, deputy general manager of the U.S. company, in a
letter to the Shanghai company.

<HEADLINE> China Urges All Villages to Embrace Democracy (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The circular also demands that all CPC village branches and
villagers' committees across the country hold regular democratic
elections according to the law and Party regulations, and never
try to delay the elections when their terms of office come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
"The will of the voters must be respected," the circular
stresses. "No one is allowed to make any attempt to manipulate the
elections, or to canvass votes by any unjust means, especially
through various forms of bribery."
</P>
<P>
While ensuring the extensive democratic rights of the farmers,
it is also necessary to guide them to learn through practice how
to exercise their democratic rights in a correct way and in
accordance with the law, the circular adds.
</P>
<P>
During the 15th CPC National Congress held in Beijing last
September, Chinese President and CPC general-secretary Jiang Zemin
said in his keynote report that China would further expand
grassroots democracy and safeguard the direct exercise of
democratic rights by the people.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Chinese government has attached greater
importance to farmers' democracy, regarding it as a major issue
that will help promote reform, development and stability in the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, at the 10th anniversary of the enforcement
of the Law on the Organization of the Villagers' Committee, the
State Council adopted a draft amendment to the law, which will
soon be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, for further
examination.
</P>
<P>
At its end, the circular also gives a message that China will
make bolder experiments in expanding democracy and increasing
government transparency.
</P>
<P>
"While promoting the open and democratic management of village
affairs in the countryside, we will also make active efforts to
seek proper ways to introduce the practice of open administration
to government bodies at the township level," it states.

BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Taking advantage of the
depreciated currencies in southeast Asia, residents in the Chinese
capital city Beijing have made southeast Asian countries their
tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing tourism administration, over 50,000 people
in Beijing traveled abroad for holidays between August last year
and February this year and most of them went sightseeing in
Thailand, Malaysia, Macao and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Five international travel agencies in Beijing began to handle
international travel business last August. By the end of April,
they had used up the annual quotas granted by the state tourism
administration, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is still control over citizens' travelling
abroad. The official tourism destinations are limited at
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, in addition to Hong
Kong and Macao.

HEFEI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will make
greater efforts to develop the service sector to make it a major
driving force for local economic growth, according to the
provincial planning commission.
</P>
<P>
The output value of Anhui's service sector will be raised to
117 billion yuan before the year 2000, up from 48.4 billion yuan
in 1984, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the payroll of the service sector will rise
to 10 million people from 7.2 million people in 1995 and the
proportion of the sector in the provincial gross domestic product
will increase from 24.1 percent to 32 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
To these ends, Anhui will seek to establish a unified, open,
and orderly competitive market system characterized by standard
management and adequate supervision.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to the development of catering trade,
transportation, postal services, banking, insurance, tourism and
real estate, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
Anhui will build one to two specialized wholesale markets
valued at 1 billion yuan or more each and a dozen smaller ones
in the next one or two years, it said.

<HEADLINE> China Urges All Villages to Embrace Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Determined to promote democracy in
every corner of its vast countryside, the Chinese central
authorities are demanding that all officials in the country's
nearly one million villages manage village affairs in an open and
democratic way and subject themselves to the villagers'
supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Open and democratic management of village affairs is conducive
to developing grassroots democracy in the rural areas, and will
guarantee the direct exercise of democratic rights by the
farmers," says a circular jointly issued by the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The circular, which was publicized here today, describes the
Chinese farmers, who account for more than 70 percent of the
country's 1.3 billion population as the "reliable force" for the
CPC in the countryside and the "most extensive and solid
foundation" for the political power of the nation.
</P>
<P>
In November of 1987 China adopted the Law on the Organization
of the Villagers' Committee which abolished the long practice that
village officials were hand-picked by governments at higher
levels. The law requires all members of the Villagers' Committee,
the formal village leadership, to be directly elected by the
entire village.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, most villages across China have held
three direct elections on their villagers' committees. More than
60 percent of the villages have adopted a system called
"villagers' self-government," which means that the farmers not
only elect their own village leadership but also monitor its
operation and have a say in all major village affairs.

<HEADLINE> Chile: Satisfied with Blatter's reelection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- In regard to the election of
Joseph Blatter as the new FIFA president, Ricardo Abumohor,
president of the Chilean National Association of Professional
Football (ANFP) declared "a task which has correctly undertaken
for years finally resulted victorious".
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Brazilian press from Paris (which was
published today), the head of the ANFP declared that Blatter was
"an expert in what has been done in the past and in the plans for
the future".
</P>
<P>
"One shouldn't think that the Latin-American football has been
successful, but a whole labor and several achievements", he said.
</P>
<P>
Abumohor continued: "I don't believe that in the case of
Johansson success, he would have liked to damage us, as part of
his program, what happens is that we feel closer to Blatter, we
already know him, he is acquainted with us and understands our
virtues and defects".
</P>
<P>
When Abuhomor was asked about the specific effect that the
promotion of Blatter to the top position of the worldwide football
should have in the Chilean population, Abumohor replied "There is
not any project in particular that has to do with his promotion,
but I can tell that the development of the Chilean football will
be maintained, and that the good image he has demonstrated at an
international level will not be changed".
</P>
<P>
In regards to Blatter's victory assuring the four positions for
South America in the next football world championship he said: "I
believe that South America has the four positions already and the
preliminary rounds will be done among everybody; there is already
a principle of agreement."

<HEADLINE> EDS-Retransmission hke -- Former U.S. Secretary of State on Sino-U.S. Relations (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
Alexander M. Haig has urged China and the United States to enhance
cooperation, while addressing differences through frequent high
level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"China, as the largest developing country, and the United
States, as the largest developed country, merit a relationship
that is multi-dimensional -- each facet as important as the other
and no one strand held hostage to the other," General Haig said in
a written interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Describing Chinese President Jiang Zemin's trip last October to
the United States as a "triumphant visit," the general said the
visit was a major step in building on the momentum of positive
high level exchanges between the leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Across the full breadth of my country, President Jiang
garnered the admiration and respect of the people with whom he
met," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The visit to China by President Bill Clinton later this month
should contribute to a better appreciation of the true value of a
strong U.S.-China relationship," Haig added.
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly during the Summit meeting in Washington,
D.C. between Presidents Clinton and Jiang, it was reaffirmed that
the interests between our two peoples are converging. We share
interests in regional and international peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
He said it was also important that the U.S. president once
again affirmed that there is but "One China" and that, "we, too,
have an interest in seeing the emergence of a China that is a
great power, stable, open and enjoying peaceful relationships with
like-minded countries worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Since Jiang's visit, there is a growing appreciation among more
Americans that the U.S. administration's policy of "constructive
engagement" with China is a sound policy.
</P>
<P>
By working together, the two countries can make possible new
opportunities for economic growth exceeding that which was
initially contemplated when China's late Chairman Mao Zedong,
Premier Zhou Enlai and former U.S. President Richard Nixon opened
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
Haig was a member of President Nixon's international security
team in the 1970s when Nixon proposed establishing a dialogue with
China.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the significance of a "constructive strategic
partnership," the general said the establishment of such a
partnership is the acknowledgment that the Sino-U.S. relationship
is more than the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
"The political, economic, and security dimensions combined
confirm the importance of a positive bilateral relationship," Haig
said. "However, when the multiplicity and breadth of U.S.-China
interests are put in context, the relationship takes on a
strategic character."
</P>
<P>
Since the summit last fall, Chinese and American government
agencies have been working to add greater substance to every facet
of their relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the economic dimension, our financial, monetary and trade
experts have worked to facilitate China becoming an even more
active member of the global market system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly in the defense sector, there has been a multiplicity
of high level exchanges between members of the armed forces of the
two countries, he said. "Through the dialogues, our respective
militaries are working to enhance understanding and promote
cooperation all towards the preservation of peace and stability in
Asia and elsewhere."

<HEADLINE> Anhui Successfully Implements Re-employment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
taken effective measures to help displaced workers find new jobs
this year, according the provincial federation of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the laid-off workers in Anhui have been
re-employed this year in addition to 150,000 new workers, with the
province's official unemployment rate controlled around the
targeted 3.5 percent level.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures to ensure re-employment of the displaced
workers is the introduction of a responsibility system among
governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities have also mobilized the higher
education institutions and professionals and vocational schools to
launch various training programs.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, Anhui has raised 87 million yuan for the
local re-employment project. The funds have benefited 270,000
laid-off workers, or 60 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
As China's moves to a market economy, more and more workers

<HEADLINE> Toronto Launches Internet Program for the Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest city of Toronto has
launched an Internet program, offering e-mail service to help
those living on the streets.
</P>
<P>
The inner-city initiative, called Voice to Screen, allows the
homeless to log on to the Internet, learn how to surf Websites for
places to live or work and send or receive e-mail for a small fee.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the homeless around the three community centers that offer
the service were reported to be unconvinced that logging on to the
Internet would make any difference in their daily struggle to
survive.
</P>
<P>
"I am interested in getting more money from the rich and making
them pay for the poor," a homeless woman was quoted as saying by
reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new Internet program is funded jointly by the Industry
Department of Canada, the city of Toronto and non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
It is "an extraordinary innovation that will have an impact,"
said one proponent of the program.
</P>
<P>
But critics argue that such a plan fail to address the No.1
problem facing the homeless, a lack of affordable housing.

<HEADLINE> Riley Calls for Efforts for Safe, Drug-Free Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Education Secretary Richard
Riley on Tuesday called for more efforts to help curb school
violence and drugs in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Schools are being asked to pick up the pieces" from a society
that glorifies violence, accepts drugs and makes it easy for young
people to get guns, Riley told a Education Department conference
on the federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools program.
</P>
<P>
Although schools are generally safe, Riley said, a number of
fatal shootings by youngsters have raised concern.
</P>
<P>
He urged lawmakers to pass spending increases for drug and
violence prevention coordinators, delinquency and truancy
prevention and after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Congress to pass bills to improve literacy, build
schools and hire more teachers.
</P>
<P>
He said, prisons are full of high school dropouts who cannot
read, Riley said, yet Congress "continues to dilly dally and
dawdle" rather than enact a 2-year old, 2.4 billion U.S. dollars
proposal by President Bill Clinton to build a corps of reading
tutors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Riley asked the National Rifle Association (NRA) to
help keep children from becoming victims of gun violence in
schools, in homes and in the street.
</P>
<P>
"I challenge the NRA to direct its attention to getting guns
out of the hands of unsupervised children."

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Plunge Further in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures prices fell
sharply Tuesday, threatening to topple more than 9-year lows on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, affected by continuous weak
demand and big supply.
</P>
<P>
Crude plunged after the International Energy Agency cut its
estimate for 1998 world oil demand because of the Asian economic
crisis. Daily demand was estimated at 75 million barrels a day,
down 100,000 barrels from earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
Demand in Asian countries, excluding Japan and China, has
fallen some 750,000 barrels a day since October, according to the
Paris-based group's figures.
</P>
<P>
Asia, with its once booming regional economy, had been an
important area for absorbing heavy crude output by most of the 11
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
non-OPEC members such as Russia and Norway.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed to the International Energy Agency's estimate
that only 1.017 million barrels of the 1.245 million pledged by
OPEC countries in the first round of cuts were taken out of the
market in May.

OUAGADOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat said here Tuesday evening the current summit meeting of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) would be of crucial
importance in guiding the continent into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is invited as observer to attend the three-day 34th
summit of Heads of State and Government of OAU, which is
scheduled to close in the Burkina Faso capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the Palestinian
president said the OAU summit was held at a "very critical and
difficult" time and will certainly play a landmark role for
Africa to march into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader believed that the two resolutions on
Palestine and the Middle East, adopted by African leaders at the
summit, would promote the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is to visit China next month, expressed his
gratitude for the "generous support" China has rendered to the
Palestinian people and their just cause in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said the friendship between Palestine and China has
developed rapidly since his first visit to China in 1963.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming visit will be another important event which
will further strengthen the friendly ties between the two sides,
particularly when China has elected its new leadership, Arafat
added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says no Lifting of Sanctions against DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday that he would be prepared to support South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung's "policy of reciprocity" toward the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), but would not
endorse his proposal to ease sanctions on the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks at a joint news conference with
President Kim after their talks at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"The United States applauds President Kim's efforts toward
reconciliation," he said. "Now we hope North Korea will respond
further to President Kim's gestures."
</P>
<P>
He said Kim had asked him to work with him to support the
"policy of reciprocity", and "I would be prepared to do that."
</P>
<P>
But when asked about the lift of sanctions, Clinton dodged a
direct answer, saying that would "require ... some legislative
change to be modified."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean leader, who is making his first state visit to
the United States since his inauguration in February, said before
his trip that he would ask the United States to ease sanctions
against the DPRK, which he believed would help ease tensions on
the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He told the joint news conference what he wanted was to "forge
an atmosphere in which we can induce the North Koreans to open
up."
</P>
<P>
"To induce them to open up will be beneficial to the interests
of our two countries, and to the peace of the peninsula and
Northeast Asia in general," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said any decision on easing sanction would be up to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States should ease sanctions against North
Korea, the when and how and the content would be a decision for
the American government to make, but we would not oppose, and we
would cooperate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Africa's External Debt up to 315 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Africa's stock of external
debt is estimated to have reached some 315 billion U.S. Dollars
at the end of last year, the African Development Bank (ADB)
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the heavy burden, the continent has to use about a
quarter of its export earnings for debt servicing, said ADB
President Omar Kabbaj at the on-going summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
A major positive development in this regard, however, is the
wide international consensus that now exists on the need to
broaden existing international initiatives to help resolve the
debt burden of African countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is especially true of the debt of the 33 countries,
which are classified as heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs),"
the bank president noted.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the debt alleviation effort, he said, his bank is
working actively with the Bretton Woods Institutions and
bilateral donors to mobilize resources to reduce the external
debt of African countries to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
A latest achievement is the signing of the agreement for
Uganda in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire last May. Under the agreement,
Uganda has received debt relief amounting to 30 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
To ease the debt of its low-income member countries, the bank
has also established the supplementary financial mechanism to
provide concessional assistance to eligible low-income countries
with outstanding ADB debt for the payment of interest due on such
loans.
</P>
<P>
An initial amount of 180 million U.S. Dollars has been
allocated for financing the program, the bank president told the
three-day summit which is scheduled to close Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Modernize Army with More Computers Less Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army announced on
Tuesday that it will modernize and mobilize its heavy combat
divisions with more computers, less personnel and fewer tanks to
prepare for 21st century battle.
</P>
<P>
"We need physical agility. We need smaller forces," General
William Hartzog, commander of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine
Command and the architect of the new design, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Each heavy division will be shrunk from 18,000 troops to 15,700
and the amount of some types of heavy equipment will be reduced,
from 58 tanks to 45 per battalion, for example, he said. But it
will have more long-range rockets, better intelligence and air
defense and new computers in both vehicles and the backpacks of
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The new Army division, Hartzog said, will be "smaller, more
agile and more lethal," to handle threats ranging from terrorism
to regional conflicts such as the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
According to the general, unit commanders will be able to
dominate an even larger battlefield, knowing where they are, where
their troops are and where the enemy is in real time.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the Army's Fourth Infantry Division at Fort Hood,
Texas, will become the first to operate under the redesign,
creating a more flexible fighting force that can cover a larger
battlefield including quick-changing threats on multiple fronts.
The remaining units would be ready by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Army has cut its size from 780,000 to 480,000 soldiers and
from 18 to 10 divisions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Hartzog said that among other advantages, the new high-tech Army
will include night vision systems that "allow soldiers to see as
far as their weapons can fire".
</P>
<P>
He said the Army is also working on plans to revise its four
other "light" divisions and on organizing permanent strike forces
of 3,000 to 5,000 troops, which in today's Army are generally put
together to go into hot spots such as Bosnia and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hartzog said, the new division's equipment is
designed to answer the three main questions soldiers and
commanders need answered while fighting: "Where am I? Where are my
subordinates? And where is the enemy?"
</P>
<P>
The new division will rely more on digital battlefield maps and
orders and less on telephones and radios, the Army said.
</P>
<P>
Hartzog said the plan was drawn from five years of intense
study.
