BUSH CAMPAIGN'S POLLING BECOMES ISSUE IN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (REVISES 2nd, 3rd and 4th grafs to lighten tone) 
 (lb)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nearly 1,000 miles from South Carolina and the bitter
political war between George W. Bush and John McCain, one flank of
the war is being fought from a four-story office building in the
northern suburbs of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the top floor, inside the offices of Voter/Consumer
Research Consumer, a few dozen people, from college students to
grandmothers, spent two days last week calling prospective voters
in South Carolina to ask them carefully scripted questions. They
began innocuously enough: Will you participate in the Republican
primary? How much attention have you paid to the GOP race? Are
things better or worse in the country?
</P>
<P>
   But the questions quickly shifted to McCain, and the tone
changed: In introducing questions, the callers stated that McCain's
tax plan does not cut rates for most people, that he had been
reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee and that his campaign
finance proposals would give labor unions and the media more
influence in deciding elections.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of poll is this? One written by the Bush campaign. The
people conducting it were not starry-eyed campaign volunteers but
were paid by the hour, not much more than minimum wage. Bush cam-
paign officials, however, say this poll is not an attack on McCain
but is typical of the sort of polling done to learn about issues
and their oppo- nents' possible weaknesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly nasty primary in which each candidate has
blamed the other for the nastiness, the usually obscure role of
telephone canvassing and polling has unexpectedly become a central
issue as hundreds of thousands of calls pour down on voters in
South Carolina. McCain has complained that Bush and his supporters
are conducting a thinly disguised telephone smear campaign, a
charge the Texas governor vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has accused the Bush polling operation of spreading
negative information about McCain, rather than truly trying to
survey South Carolina voters. Such polling _ in which pollsters
give the impression that they are conducting a real poll, when they
are actually posing questions that spread doubts about the opponent
_ is known as ``push polling.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation has put Bush on the defensive. ``It is just
ridiculous, it is unbelievable, this whole kind of thing about, you
know, Bush is push-polling, and we're not,'' Bush told host Tim
Russert on Sunday on `Meet the Press.' ``We're the one campaign,
Tim, that has said, `You're welcome to look at any phone script
that we pay for.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said McCain and others had
mistakenly confused the Bush campaign's use of ``advocacy calling''
_ designed to drum up support _ with its polling. Fleischer said
the campaign had made 200,000 advocacy calls into South Carolina,
in which callers read a script essentially blaming the negative
tenor of the race on McCain, and then ask if the respondent would
vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the McCain questioning in South Carolina, conducted
by a firm called Public Opinion Strategies, appears designed to
gauge support for the Republican contenders, and to determine which
issues resonate with voters, and whether they regard themselves as
conservative or liberal.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the questionnaire was provided by the McCain
organization and it does not include any questions or comments that
attack Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, several people at McCain rallies have told
stories of telephone calls that they said distorted McCain's record
and his personal history.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became public last week when a woman at a McCain rally
said her teen-age son answered the phone and heard McCain called a
liar, a cheat and a fraud. Then Marsha White, the wife of the mayor
of Greenville, a McCain supporter, said she had received a similar
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a couple of hundred calls in our office for
people who say they've gotten these calls,'' said McCain's
spokesman, Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleischer said no such calls had been made by the Bush
campaign. To prove his point, on Sunday he released the script from
the poll conducted by Voter Consumer Research, the group that is
working from the Houston office building.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer emphasized that this script was different from the
massive advocacy calls. He conceded that the wording seemed loaded
in several questions, but he said the scope of the survey was
limited to 300 respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that unlike push polling, which targets thousands
of people, the Voter Consumer Research survey was specifically
designed to determine which issues were resonating with voters in
South Carolina. He said the campaign might use its findings to
create television commercials. These, presumably, would be aimed at
whatever those surveyed mentioned as McCain's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys gather research,'' Fleischer said, noting that the
small size of the survey would preclude it from influencing many
voters. ``Surveys are meant to figure out what people are
thinking.'' He added, ``Push polls are taken with hundreds of
thousands of people, or tens of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Frankovic, the director of surveys for CBS News,
reviewed the questions from the Bush campaign survey over the
telephone, and though she did not know if the assertions made about
McCain were true, she described the survey as ``fairly common'' and
``not unusual.'' She said political campaigns use partisan polling
to test attack lines much the same way that marketers poll people
to try out new slogans for products.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast to the long, detailed questions, she said push polls
are usually short and punchy in order to reach as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky described the wording of several questions in the Bush
survey as inaccurate. He said McCain's tax plan provides cuts for
people in every income bracket, and he said the senator was never
reprimanded bythe Senate Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the questions are accurate. He also said some
Bush supporters have received push-poll phone calls about the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Traugott, president of the American Association for
Public Opinion Research, an organization of commercial, political
and academic pollsters, said that push polling is designed to
accomplish one of two things: to either convince people to change
from one candidate to another, or suppress an opponent's vote by
tarnishing his reputation in the eyes of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deleterious and invidious effects to this,'' said
Traugott, who also teaches at the University of Michigan. ``This is
an unpleasant experience for most citizens, and we think it
increases their cynicism about politics and politicians.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the type of calls made by the Bush campaign, Traugott
said, ``There's a very thin line between advocacy calling, where
you have people calling around to promote your candidacy, as
opposed to negative-persuasion telephoning, which is designed to
move you away from another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   One unknown quantity in evaluating the use of polls is that a
number of calls are being made on behalf of candidates by
organizations other than the two campaigns. Published reports have
suggested that groups such as the National Right to Life, as well
as pro-tobacco organizations, are planning to make calls in South
Carolina on behalf of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he does not know what other organizations are
doing, and he has promised to fire anyone from his campaign if they
are involved in push polling.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston it is almost impossible to detect that the bland
brick building not far from a shopping center is actually a nerve
center in the presidential race. Bush first hired Voter Consumer
Research during his gubernatorial race, and the company now
operates phone banks north of the city. Some of its customers are
companies interested in testing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   But one employee said that political races are dominating
business now, particularly the South Carolina primary. Inside,
employees sit in front of computer screens, earning an hourly rate
to ask the same questions over and over again. One woman said the
average rate is $6 an hour. According to employees, every
conversation is monitored electronically to ensure that callers do
not stray from the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, according to one employee, supervisors warned the
staff against speaking to reporters. One woman said that McCain is
not the only object of polling. She said she had spent time asking
questions of voters around the nation about Vice President Al Gore.
One of the questions, she said, was about opinions on Gore's now
retracted claim that he invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The woman laughed and described the process as ``mudslinging.''

NOW A STAR, VAN GUNDY STILL TAKES SOME NICKS  
 MALONE SAYS HE'S NOT MIFFED  
 MAGIC MAY GET SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ During a visit to San Francisco's Chinatown
over the weekend, a certain coach from New York was noticed among
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's Nick Van Gundy,'' said a man, shaking Jeff Van
Gundy's hand with delight.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said: ``They forget the Knicks is not my first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Van Gundy, a native of the Bay Area, found out
anything as he returned here as coach of the Eastern Conference
All-Stars, it is that he is no longer the diminutive, anonymous guy
roaming the sideline at Madison Square Garden. He has come a long
way from the day Rick Pitino extended his hand to welcome him to
the Providence Friars as a graduate assistant coach by saying,
``Congratulations, Jim, you've got the job.''
</P>
<P>
   After regaling sportswriters with his own Horatio Alger story
last week, Van Gundy received one of the largest ovations before
the 49th All-Star Game at The Arena in Oakland. The old-school
purist who continually took shots at Commissioner David Stern's
league is now just as much a part of the product as any marquee
sideline tactician.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he exactly reveled in this gaudy weekend affair. With
the N BA turning the Bay Area into an excessively long party, Van
Gundy's agenda Saturday night involved watching game tapes of the
Knicks' next opponent, Toronto, in his hotel room. ``What else you
going to do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Mercury News referred to Van Gundy as Martinez's
``second favorite son,'' next to Joe DiMaggio, who was also born in
the small town north of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy gained a greater appreciation for some players and was
surprised when Vince Carter apologized for being late to practice
on Saturday. But the coach added with a smile, ``Some of them are
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Van Gundy was not beyond taking on the flash and flair of
the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I hate? I watched that rookie game,'' he said.
``They play harder in the All-Star Game than they do in that game.
And that's every year. So I wonder, if the older guys can show more
respect for how the game is supposed to be played, why wouldn't
young guys? I'm not indicting young players. But I just think that
game is too loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans want to see competition. They should practice like six
one-on-one games. What fans wouldn't want to come out and see Eddie
Jones play Grant Hill one on one? Or someone trying to guard Allen
Iverson? Grant Hill versus Vince Carter. Come on. I'd want to see
that. I just think it could be such a great game. I think there's a
misconception by maybe those players about what fans want to see.
Or maybe I have the misconception. Maybe that is what everyone
wants to see.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked what it felt like to be part of All-Star Weekend,
to be a commodity in a changing NBA he never seemed to enjoy or
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're selling me,'' Van Gundy said before he gave the
East a pregame speech, ``it's going broke.''
</P>
<P>
   MALONE SAYS HE'S NOT MIFFED
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular thought last week, Karl Malone is not a
stodgy, old complainer who is emotionally wounded because the NBA
is promoting young players more than, say, stodgy, old complainers.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what the Mailman said Sunday before his 15th
All-Star Game. Fined $10,000 by the league for not attending
Friday's news media session, said to be upset because he was not
voted to the Eastern Conference team as a starter this year at age
37, Malone finally rolled into town this morning after foregoing
most of the weekend festivities.
</P>
<P>
   He originally hinted that he would miss the game to rest nagging
minor injuries, but after a stiff fine from the NBA was threatened,
he ended up relenting. Malone said he spent time with his family
and was never basing his decision on the fact that he was bothered
by the league's decision to market younger and more athletic
players.
</P>
<P>
   `` I wanted to see my kids play, and I didn't know it was a big
deal,'' Malone. ``I saw everything from `he wasn't voted in' to
everything else. And nothing came from me. I've come to every media
session we've had for 15 years and I had an opportunity to go see
my kids play, and that's what I did. That's the issue I want to
clear up.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Malone, John Stockton and David Robinson were the
only holdovers from the 1992 Dream Team to be selected to the game.
At the 1998 game in New York, Malone was so miffed about Kobe
Bryant's waving him off during a pick-and-roll play, he said he
would never play in another All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's water under the bridge,'' Malone said. ``I was
frustrated at the time. Kobe and I have talked about that several
times since it happened. I always planned to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to play ``five or six minutes,'' adding that,
``I'm not playing 20 or 30.'' Told that Phil Jackson, the West
coach, joked that he would play 40 minutes, Malone said: ``I'm very
coachable. But you can tell Coach I'm not playing 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   MAGIC MAY GET SERIOUS
</P>
<P>
   For most of their careers it was Like Magic, Like Michael. But
after Michael Jordan took over recently as head of basketball
operations for the Washington Wizards, Magic Johnson is thinking
about his own serious foray into team management.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the Western Conference said Johnson has expressed
interest in taking over the Dallas Mavericks' basketball operations
after this season. Isiah Thomas, the NBC analyst and Continental
Basketball Association owner, has also expressed interest in
working for the Mavericks and their new owner, Mark Cuban. Johnson
will seriously pursue a position only if Thomas does not do so.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has also been reportedly interested in resurrecting the
Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm saying is, people have put me with certain people,''
Johnson said. ``This may just be a conversation, so don't make it
like Earvin is getting back into it. Because maybe not. I love what
I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Johnson is an executive vice president with the Los
Angeles Lakers and maintains 5 percent ownership in the team, his
primary basketball interests are directed in playing and coaching a
traveling all-star team in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm trying to get a job,'' he said. ``But if I
am going to do it, it's got to be on my terms. Because I know why
these different teams are losing. Everybody has got to be about
winning. Wherever I go to. It can't be like the old ways. You got
to be about winning. Because if you're not, there's no sense doing
it. I can sit on the sideline and live a happy life.''

ISLANDERS' VICTORY COMES AT BAD TIME FOR RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time was of the essence Sunday night at Madison
Square Garden when the Rangers played the Islanders. The game
started a half-hour earlier than usual, and maybe that was why Theo
Fleury of the Rangers showed up later than everyone else before
leaving early with the flu. Time stood still twice in the second
period and once it helped the Rangers score a tainted goal.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the horn blew to end regulation time, the Islanders
had a 4-2 victory. They had not defeated the Rangers in Manhattan
since January 1997. The Islanders now have a three-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The result left the Rangers in seventh place in the Eastern
Conference, which will send eight teams to the Stanley Cup
playoffs. They remain one point ahead of eighth-place Pittsburgh
and three ahead of ninth-place Buffalo. The Islanders remain in
13th place in the 15-team conference.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final game of the season series between these rivals,
ending the series at 2-2-1. Kevin Weekes, the Islanders' goalie,
has defeated the Rangers four times this season _ twice with
Vancouver and twice with the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Krog scored his first NHL goal for the Islanders. The
others were scored by Josh Green, Mathieu Biron and Claude
Lapointe. Jorgen Jonsson had three assists. Jan Hlavac and Radek
Dvorek scored for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders played without Eric Cairns, their large
defenseman, who was suspended for an altercation on Saturday night.
After Cairns and Pittsburgh's Matthew Barnaby were sent off the ice
with penalties, they met in the corridor in Nassau Coliseum and
menaced each other. Cairns, a former Ranger, landed a punch before
security guards broke it up. Both are suspended indefinitely. The
Islanders were also without two injured defensemen; Zdeno Chara has
a shoulder injury and Kenny Jonsson has post-concussion symptoms.
So the Islanders called up defenseman Aris Brimanis from Kansas
City of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac, the Ranger rookie who scored three times in the previous
game, gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 7:37 on their second shot of
the game. He scored off the rush, set up by Petr Nedved and Dvorak.
</P>
<P>
   After Nedved pulled Weekes out of position, he sent a backhand
pass across the crease to Hlavac, who steered it into the vacated
net for his 14th goal of the season. Although the Rangers took the
lead into the second period, they were being out-shot by 10-6 and
outhit by 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Islanders tied it the score at 1-1 on
Krog's goal. It came shortly after an Islanders power play and was
set up by some slick passing from Jorgen Jonsson and Mariusz
Czerkawski.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went ahead by 2-1 at 7:16 on a disputed goal. Dvorak
put a rebound past Weekes just seconds after Gino Odjick of the
Islanders left the penalty box. But Odjick was still skating toward
the play when the puck crossed the line and the Islanders protested
_ with justification _ that he should have been released earlier.
The problem was the scoreboard clock, which failed to start for 14
seconds after the previous face-off. Because of this, the Rangers'
power play lasted 2:14. Although the officials adjusted the time
remaining, reducing it by 14 seconds, they did not erase the goal.
Earlier in the period, after the Islanders first goal, the clock
froze for about 50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders tied the score at 2-2 at 8:20 on a goal by Green,
who knocked in a rebound after a shot by Jamie Heward, and they
took a 3-2 lead at 16:20 on a goal by Biron that was set up by
Jorgen Jonsson.

DEAD ROBBER TO GET HIS DAY IN COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTANDT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With 29 gunshot wounds from a furious gun battle
with police, North Hollywood bank robber Emil Matasareanu bled to
death while handcuffed and under heavy guard in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That much is not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, a federal civil jury in Los Angeles will
begin to hear evidence about whether police deliberately denied
Matasareanu medical aid after an accomplice was killed and 11
officers and six civilians were wounded during the North Hollywood
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence of the crime, Matasareanu's family believes
it is entitled to hold the city liable, claiming officers
deliberately let him bleed to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son _ yes, he did wrong, but what they did was even more
wrong. They let him die,'' said Matasareanu's mother, Valerie
Nicolescu-Matasareanu. ``They became judge and executioner.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated trial is expected to contain surprises,
including whether Matasareanu and Larry Phillips Jr. were alone in
robbing the Bank of America on Feb. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The city's attorneys said officers acted properly by waiting to
call in paramedics immediately because they were unsure whether
other robbers were still in the neighborhood and whether
Matasareanu was booby-trapped with bombs.
</P>
<P>
   They also dispute Matasareanu's attorney's claim that the
hulking bank robber asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the opposite _ he told them to shoot him in the head,''
said Senior Assistant City Attorney Don Vincent, who is defending
the city, former police Chief Daryl F. Gates and former Officer
James Vojtecky against accusations of federal civil rights
violations. A third defendant, retired Officer John Futrell, is
represented by a private attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an ambulance there 10 minutes after the shooting
subsided. The care was there.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Daily News story after the robbery, one of the
police officers said he asked Matasareanu, ``How many other guys
are we looking for; how many are there?''
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu reportedly looked up at the officer and sneered:
``F--- you. Shoot me in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Stephen Yagman, who is bringing the lawsuit on behalf
of Matasareanu's two children, said the police had a duty to do all
possible to save his life, regardless of what he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite irrelevant whether he himself wanted or did not
want help because the legal responsibility of the police would have
been exactly the same, to take appropriate action with respect to
his serious medical needs,'' said Yagman, who has won many lawsuits
against the LAPD for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu's two children, 4-year-old Alexander and 8-year-old
Emil Jr., live in the Los Angeles area with their mother, who
declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the first lawsuit arising out of the shootout will
put the officers' decisions, minute by minute, under intense
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Following a botched robbery at the bank, the two men, wearing
full body armor, fired more than 1,200 rounds of ammunition from
automatic weapons during the televised 44-minute gun battle.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips died after shooting himself _ he had already been shot
by police but the heavily armored Matasareanu continued his
rampage. He was wounded and handcuffed at about 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Futrell, a senior lead officer who was not involved in any of
the shooting, arrived near Matasareanu at about 10:04 a.m., said
his attorney, Bradley C. Gage.
</P>
<P>
   Futrell told Matasareanu to stay still so the wounded gunman
would not further hurt himself, Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent said police were unsure whether other gunmen were in the
area, and they also feared Matasareanu's heavily armored body might
be booby-trapped with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Gage believes there were more than two robbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt in my mind that there were a minimum of three
bank robbers,'' Gage said, basing his assessment on a report that
there was further assault weapon fire after Phillips was dead and
Matasareanu was under arrest. In his complaint, Yagman claimed
there were six robbers, three of whom escaped and one of whom,
apart from Matasareanu, was arrested by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emil Matasareanu was seriously wounded by the police (and)
could have been saved but was left to bleed to death,'' Yagman
declared in the complaint. ``By permitting him to bleed to death,
the police permitted the only source of information that ever would
be available to them to cease to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to testify will be Vojtecky, who was in
charge of guarding Matasareanu and said he heard the gunman ask to
be shot in the head, Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said they eventually learned _ and now insist _ that
Matasareanu and Phillips were the only robbers.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   As Matasareanu bled, Futrell told paramedics he needed only one
ambulance for Matasareanu, not the several he believed were being
dispatched, Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   Gage said he will show that fire officials felt it was too
dangerous to send the ambulance, but the paramedic crew came anyway
at about 10:07 a.m., Gage said. Instead of treating Matasareanu or
a wounded officer, the crew aided a civilian who had been shot in
the head, Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   When another ambulance had not arrived by about 10:45 a.m.,
Futrell made a second call, but it did not go through because of
heavy radio traffic, Gage said. After his third call at about 10:50
a.m., an ambulance arrived within five to eight minutes, Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics pronounced 30-year-old Matasareanu dead at about
11:10 a.m., but a second autopsy report puts the likely time of
death at 10:50 a.m., Gage said. Matasareanu bled to death from a
thigh wound, according to an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives continue to look for some $900,000 in missing loot
from the pair's bank and armored car robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Yagman said he hopes to convince 12 jurors that officers
Vojtecky and Futrell, now retired, violated Matasareanu's civil
rights by showing ``deliberate indifference'' to his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to provide medical attention, police
``cold-bloodedly murdered'' Matasareanu, Yagman said in the
complaint. ``These defendants created the dangerous situation that
caused decedent's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Yagman refused to discuss the lawsuit in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty other officers who were originally named in the suit,
including then-Police Chief Willie L. Williams, were dropped
because Yagman said he could find no wrongdoing on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury finds Vojtecky and Futrell liable, the case would
shift focus to the only other individual defendant, former police
Chief Gates, according to Gage.
</P>
<P>
   Yagman said he hopes to prove that Gates, who retired nearly
five years before the shootout, fostered a departmentwide
``custom'' of officers mistreating people, as he claims happened
with Matasareanu.
</P>
<P>
   That is one threshold for seeking damages from the city.
</P>
<P>
   In case damages are awarded, the city has countersued to recoup
some of the estimated $1 million it spent on repairs, legal fees
and pensions for officers forced to retire because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys do not expect the lawsuit to get that far, and
will challenge it in a pretrial motion to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this suit will likely have great impact on a
separate lawsuit brought by Valerie Nicolescu-Matasareanu, who is
suing the city and 50 unnamed police officers for identical civil
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of support for police on the eve of the lawsuit, a
group of San Fernando Valley anti-crime activists will gather today
across from the Bank of America to encourage citizens to bring
flowers to police stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stand by our officers throughout this trial,''
said Mary Lou Holte.

SCREAMIN' JAY HAWKINS, 70, ROCK'S WILD MAN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Information on survivors was not available Sunday.) 
(nk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Screamin' Jay Hawkins, who howled, whooped, gurgled and shrieked
his way through some of the most unhinged performances in rock
history, died on Saturday in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris.
He was 70 and lived near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was multiple organ failure following emergency surgery
to treat an aneurysm, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' 1956 hit, ``I Put a Spell on You,'' defined a career
built on vocal dementia, imagery lifted from voodoo folklore and
B-movies, an anarchic sense of humor and a stage show that raised
the stakes on rock 'n' roll theatricality. He took stereotypes of
black savagery _ cannibals, witch doctors _ and mocked them with
gleeful hyperbole. He would arrive on stage in a flaming coffin,
wearing a black satin cape and, sometimes, a bone in his nose,
clutching a cane topped by a flaming, cigarette-smoking skull named
Henry. Snakes, tarantulas, shrunken heads and a crawling hand were
also part of the act.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was singing his own songs or tearing into a
sentimental standard, Hawkins might at any moment jettison the
melody for shouts, moans or bursts of gibberish. ``I don't sing
them,'' he once said of his songs. ``I destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was part of a tradition of rhythm-and-blues wild men that
also included Little Richard, and he was the precursor of rock
showmen like Jimi Hendrix, Alice Cooper, Marilyn Manson and White
Zombie.
</P>
<P>
   Jalacy J. Hawkins was born on July 18, 1929, in Cleveland. His
mother had seven children, each with a different father. He grew up
in foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mama said that out of all the men, my father was the
hardest, the meanest and the rottenest,'' he once said. ``She would
look at me and say, `You're no good, you're gonna be just like your
father.' I said: `I'm gonna fool you. I'm gonna make something of
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   He began playing piano as a child and studied opera at the Ohio
Conservatory of Music. He was also a boxer and won a Golden Gloves
championship in 1943. When he returned to the United States after
military service, he wanted a career in opera. ``I had hopes that
someday I could become a black Mario Lanza or Enrico Caruso,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But to make a living he turned to the jazz and rhythm-and-blues
circuit, stretching his voice to imitate the sounds of honking
tenor saxophonists. He began working for the jazz guitarist Tiny
Grimes as valet and pianist, and in 1951 he made his first single,
``Why Did You Waste My Time,'' backed by Grimes and his Rockin'
Highlanders.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded for Timely and Wing Records, and joined Fats
Domino's road band for a short time. In 1956 he planned to record a
plaintive ballad, ``I Put a Spell on You'' for Okeh Records. The
producer, Hawkins said, ``bought gin and whiskey, a lot of booze,
baby, and got us all drunk in the recording studio.''
</P>
<P>
   The unruly, unforgettable results became a hit that was banned
by many radio stations for its moans and grunts. Reveling in his
untamed image, he followed up with songs like ``Feast of the
Mau-Mau'' and ``Alligator Wine.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc jockey and promoter Allan Freed got the idea of
bringing Hawkins onstage in a coffin for a Cleveland concert.
Hawkins once said Freed paid him $5,000 to persuade him to go
through with it, although other accounts say the bonus was $300. It
thrilled the crowd, and the coffin became a regular part of the
show. On one multiple bill the Drifters locked Hawkins inside the
coffin; he wriggled until it fell off its stand.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins grew tired of having to play what he called ``that
weird, voodoo, black, screaming Vincent Price image,'' and in the
early 1960s he moved to Hawaii, where he bought a bar and tried to
settle down. But by the late '60s Hawkins had resumed performing,
playing up his bogeyman image even as he protested that he still
hoped to sing opera.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins toured regularly in the United States and Europe. He
opened the 1980 concert by the Rolling Stones at Madison Square
Garden, and Keith Richards produced a remake of ``I Put a Spell on
You.'' Movie appearances periodically stoked Hawkins' career. He
was seen in ``American Hot Wax'' in 1978, ``Mystery Train'' in 1989
and in ``A Rage in Harlem'' in 1991. In 1998 he received the
Pioneer Award from the Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many early rock performers, Hawkins owned the copyright
to his songs, including ``I Put a Spell on You,'' which brought
royalties when it was recorded by performers including Nina Simone
and Creedence Clearwater Revival. In 1997 ``I Put a Spell on You''
was sampled by the Notorious B.I.G. for ``Kick in the Door'' on his
million-selling album ``Life After Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote in my will to cremate me,'' Hawkins said. ``Fly over
the ocean and scatter the dust, so I can be little particles in
everybody's eyes, drive everybody crazy the rest of their lives.''

STABILIZER MECHANISM WEAR NOTED IN 1997 REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stabilizer control mechanism on Alaska Airlines Flight 261
was found to be worn and in need of replacement more than two years
ago, but the airline decided not to replace it, the National
Transportation Safety Board said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism in question consists of a jackscrew and a fixed
nut that moves the horizontal stabilizer atop of the plane's tail.
It has become the focus of the investigation into the Jan. 31 crash
off the California coast that killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday night, safety board chairman Jim Hall said
the plane MD-83 that crashed underwent a heavy maintenance check on
Sept. 29, 1997 at Alaska's maintenance facility in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most recent time that mechanics inspected the
jackscrew and nut assembly for tolerances, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   During that check, Hall said, the jackscrew and nut underwent
what is known as an ``end play check,'' in order to determine if
the amount of wear on the assembly was within tolerances specified
by Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   According to maintenance records, the check showed the assembly
was ``at maximum allowable end-play limit'' and the ``initial
planned action was to replace the nut,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision was re-evaluated and the assembly was
re-inspected on Sept. 30, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maintenance record entry also indicates that the results
of the re-check fell within the specified tolerances,'' Hall said.
``The record further reflects that it was re-checked five times
with the same result.''
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines maintenance inspector signed off on each
re-check, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is continuing a ``meticulous examination'' of
Alaska's maintenance records, Hall said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this information is continuing to be
evaluated by the ... Safety Board. No determination has been made
as to whether this information has any bearing on the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of Flight 261 had reported a serious stabilizer
problem, and the jackscrew mechanism and nut were found to have
been badly worn and damaged when they were recovered from the ocean
last week.
</P>
<P>
   When two more Alaska MD-80 series planes were found last week
with jackscrew problems, the government ordered all similar planes
in the U.S. fleet inspected,
</P>
<P>
   Airlines had reported finding jackscrew problems in 22 planes by
midday Sunday. More than 1,100 must be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska said it grounded eight of its MD-80 series planes after
finding potential problems with the jackscrew assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the plane plunged into the ocean, it is clear
that a jammed stabilizer on the MD-83 set in motion a chain of
events that resulted in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But aviation experts say it is far from certain that Flight
261's stabilizer problems caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stabilizer was definitely part of the causal sequence,''
said Bill Waldock, a crash investigator and associate director of
the Center for Aerospace Safety and Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other experts said there may be other explanations
for the plane's final dive, including a rare tail stall or even
that wing flaps were ripped off because pilots deployed them while
the jet was flying too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of Flight 261 were able to control the doomed jet for
nine minutes after the stabilizer jammed in its full ``nose-down''
trim position, sending the jet into an initial dive of more than a
mile from its cruising altitude of 31,000.
</P>
<P>
   At 18,000 feet, they were preparing for an emergency landing at
Los Angeles International Airport when the plane made a second and
far more violent dive _ just four seconds after the wing flaps were
extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still the key question: What caused the final dive? It
may or may not have been the stabilizer,'' said John Hansman, head
of the aeronautics and astronautics department at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators may not have an answer for months, and major
investigations like this can take a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wreckage of Flight 261 has yet to be pulled from the
ocean, and the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are
still being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Radar tracking records indicate something came off the plane
just as it began its horrifying plunge toward the Pacific, raising
speculation the stabilizer itself broke off.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the radar data, the U.S. Navy has been searching for
pieces of the airplane about four miles from the main impact point.
They have found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy has recovered from the main crash site several
large pieces of both the right and left side of the 40-foot-long
stabilizer, as well as portions of the right and left elevators.
</P>
<P>
   The elevators, attached to the rear of the stabilizer, make the
plane go up or down when the pilot pulls or pushes on the control
column, or yoke.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the wreckage recovered, it now appears the stabilizer
was probably intact when the plane hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   If so, what broke off Flight 261?
</P>
<P>
   Most likely it was the left wing flaps, said Chuck Eastlake, a
pilot and professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle's
campus in Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   If the left flaps ripped off, the plane would have been sent
into a rapid dive and roll to the left, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what happened to Flight 261. The plane dived and
went into a rapid, 60-degree-per-second roll to the left, becoming
inverted before smashing into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder shows Flight 261 was flying at 270
knots, with the stabilizer jammed in the full nose-down trim
position, when the pilots extended the flaps 11 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Flaps are extended for landing and take off. They provide more
lift at slower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the flaps down for landing on the MD-80-type plane
pitches the nose down, and the pilots of Flight 261 were already
having problems keeping the nose up because of the jammed
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Capt. Ted Thompson and First Officer William Tansky may
both have been pulling back on the control column to counter the
extreme force of the jammed stabilizer that was pushing the nose
down, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder shows the pilots were using about half
their elevator control to counter the plane's nose-down problem.
They may not have known how much elevator they had left, and put
down the flaps at high speed to help maintain control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only needed half the elevator deflection to counter the
jammed stabilizer,'' Eastlake said. ``They may have been worried
about losing control of the plane if they slowed down any more, so
they put the flaps out going too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastlake theorizes the left flap then ripped off. So does former
airline pilot Dan Gellert of Sequim, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is `what caused this incredible sequence of
events at 18,000 feet,''' he said. ``Something very drastic had to
happen to cause all of these events in such a short time. And what
really sticks out for me is that the flaps were extended to 11
degrees and then the upset happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellert has flown for Eastern and Alaska airlines, among others,
and is an experienced pilot in the DC-9, which was the basic design
for the MD-80 series.
</P>
<P>
   He said the pilots were going too fast for the wing flaps to be
extended 11 degrees, and ``They probably would have ripped off the
plane at that speed.''
</P>
<P>
   John Thom, a Boeing spokesman in Long Beach, Calif., where the
MD-80-series planes were made, said the manual recommends a maximum
speed of 240 knots for a flap extension of 10.1 to 20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But flaps can be extended up to 10 degrees at speeds up to 280
knots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they will find the pieces that may have broken off
the plane,' Eastlake said. ``That would be conclusive whether it
was the flaps or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the flaps are found away from the main wreckage it would
not prove they broke off and caused the final dive, however. They
could have come off after the dive began, as the plane experienced
a negative 3 ``Gs'' of acceleration and exceeded its design
limitations. Anything not tied down would have been hurled into the
ceiling at three times the force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   With flaps retracted, the MD-80 is designed to withstand a
maximum of 2.1 positive Gs to a maximum of 1 negative G. Flaps
extended, the operating limit is positive 2 Gs to zero.

INCONSISTENCIES IN ACCOUNTS BY WITNESS OF DIALLO SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty days after Amadou Diallo died, WNBC-TV
broadcast last Feb. 24 an interview with Schrrie Elliott, a Bronx
woman who appeared to be the only bystander to have witnessed his
shooting by four police officers. The report suggested that Elliott
had been less than half a block away, on the same side of the
street as the officers and Diallo's building.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, WNBC broadcast another interview with Elliott,
whose face was hidden in both interviews. This time, however, the
report suggested she had been across the street, looking into the
vestibule where Diallo was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports indicate both the importance and unpredictability of
Elliott, 32, who is to testify Monday for the second time in the
officers' murder trial in Albany. She could corroborate or refute
what the officers say happened that night, but her recounting of
what she saw has rarely been consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Those inconsistencies will take center stage when Elliott, who
was first called to the stand last week as a defense witness _ only
to deliver testimony that was more helpful than hurtful to the
defense _ returns as a witness now labeled ``adverse'' to the
defense. The officers _ Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss, Edward McMellon
and Richard Murphy _ will also begin taking the stand Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That ``adverse'' label will allow defense lawyers to
cross-examine her on her previous statements _ to WNBC, to the FBI
and to a Bronx grand jury. In doing so, they will try to destroy
her credibility on everything except one key point: that she heard
a police officer shout ``Gun!'' just before the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   They will have as ammunition her own troubled history, including
a criminal record. Her previous troubles with the law underscore
that for all parties concerned _ not least Elliott _ her witnessing
the shooting was an unfortunate twist of fate. ``I really believe
this was her worst nightmare,'' her sister, Shneaqua Elliott, said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   By her sister's account, witnessing the shooting was deeply
traumatic for Schrrie Elliott, who had visited a cousin in the
Bronx and was walking from the Elder Avenue subway stop in
Soundview to her home on Evergreen Avenue when she saw the shooting
on Wheeler Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Shneaqua Elliott said that when she returned home later that
morning, Schrrie was anxious and trembling. ``She just looked like
she had run 10 blocks,'' Shneaqua Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Schrrie Elliott told the grand jury that she did not leave her
home for two weeks after the shooting. But prosecutors said in
court last Thursday that their records show she had appeared in
court regarding a pending criminal case against her on Feb. 4, 1999
_ hours after the shooting.

DAVIES SEES HER WAY TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Laura Davies beckoned them all, which
turned out to be just so much show.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend at the Los Angeles Women's Championship would
ultimately be dominated by Davies, bad weather, and of course, eye
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Davies _ the plain-speaking, now clear-eyed Englishwoman _ saw
her three-stroke lead vanish quickly on a soaking Sunday afternoon
at the Wood Ranch Golf Club, an opening that only teased would-be
pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   Davies twiced regrouped after a pair of bogey runs, eschewing
driver and umbrella on the way to a three-stroke victory in the
$750,000 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Under a constant drizzle that left some holes in standing water,
Davies played it conservatively with a one-over-par 73, finishing
five strokes under at 211 in the 54-hole LPGA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The unpleasant weather played havoc with nearly everyone's game.
Among the top ten finishers, only Carin Koch _ who along with
Michele Redman and Janice Moodie, tied for second _ broke par
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Davies double-bogeyed the water-drenched first hole, but so did
five others who began the day three or four strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no runaway, but no one could sustain a charge.
Dottie Pepper caught Davies for a moment after three holes, then
faded. Mi Hyun Kim, Lorie Kane, Redman and Koch all closed to
within a stroke at different times but could never climb the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hope abounded. It looked like plenty at least had a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to see my name on the leaderboard,'' Koch said.
``I thought, `Nobody is doing too much.' I saw the board change a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which got Davies' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was panicking a little bit,'' Davies said. ``That's the way
it is. I'm not trying to trick anyone to think it's easy. It's hard
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But every time Davies wobbled and appeared as if she might
falter, she was able to right herself and come back with a big
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Redman had pulled to within one for the second time after Davies
bogeyed 14, but Davies came back with an eight-foot putt for birdie
on 14 and then all but clinched the tournament with a 40-foot chip
for a final birdie on 17.
</P>
<P>
   For Davies, who had spur-of-the-moment laser eye surgery the day
before the tournament began, it marked only her second LPGA victory
in the past 34 months. It was her 18th tour victory overall, the
first she won without breaking par on the final day, and the first
with that spiffy new vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could focus on the trophy on 18,'' she said. ``It was the
first time I'd seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   With two days of mostly solid rain, the roughs and bunkers were
heavy and wet. Davies went for accuracy and decided against using
her driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was just to hit the fairway,'' she said. ``We played
with a 3-iron all the way around, except the par 3s. We sacrificed
some length, but the tactic paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have looked very pretty, but when you have the
lead, you do what you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies said she briefly considered switching plans at the
five-par sixth, but her caddie, Terry Mundy, talked her out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry said, `We have a plan. Let's win with it or lose with
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moodie was two strokes back at 2-under after she hit a 20-foot
putt to birdie 17. Moodie realized she had a chance to put some
pressure on Davies going into the clubhouse and take second by
herself. But she just missed an 17-foot birdie putt on 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `This putt could get me some cabbage,'''
Moodie said.
</P>
<P>
   Davies earned $112,500 with the victory. Moodie, Koch, and
Redman each took $53,465.
</P>
<P>
   Redman said she intentionaly did not study the leaderboard and
was unaware she was only trailing Davies by one shot after 14
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' Redman said. ``I tried really hard to just
play my game and not look at the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I hit the ball pretty well today, because it was
really tough out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies did not win an LPGA tournament last season for the first
time in seven years but said she is a much improved player from 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a better player now,'' she said, ``and I have better
eyes.''

AN AILING CARDINAL INSPIRES WITH A SERMON ON SUFFERING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back from a journey to the Holy See that was most
likely the last of his life, Cardinal John O'Connor spoke to
worshipers at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday about the ``power
of suffering'' in a homily that for many crystallized his own
illness and his impending retirement as archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's farewell visit last week with Pope John Paul II, who
elevated him to archbishop 16 years ago, happened to coincide with
the first day of a special four-day Holy Year event dedicated to
the sick, when thousands of Roman Catholics struck by illness and
infirmities gathered in Vatican City in St. Peter's Square. The
cardinal could have sat among them: Last year, he underwent surgery
to remove a brain tumor, followed by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said he was touched by the tenderness of the pope,
who is also frail and aging, in addressing the faithful. ``It was
amazing to watch the Holy Father, because there was so much love
being radiated,'' the cardinal said. ``One could not but be deeply
moved.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal did not mention his own retirement or discussions
with the pope over who would succeed him. A spokesman for the
cardinal, Joseph Zwilling, said the next archbishop would be named
next month.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor tendered his resignation on his 75th birthday five
years ago, in keeping with church tradition. But with his 80th
birthday last month, the cardinal lost his vote for the next pope,
making his retirement in the coming weeks a near certainty. Last
week, he wrote of his impending retirement in a farewell letter to
fellow bishops in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Associates have said that before his own illness, when O'Connor
was still strong enough to visit priests who were sick or dying, he
would tell them that they might have felt stronger when their
health was good but were spiritually most powerful in their pain
and anguish. His message was much the same Sunday. As worshipers
listened, many wept silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can contribute by offering up our sufferings,'' he said.
``Suffering is a viable use to offer to Almighty God.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermott Smith, who was visiting New York from St. Louis, was
among those who seemed overwhelmed by the sermon. ``It was very
down to earth,'' he said, ``simple and moving.'' Smith said that
the last time he stood in St. Patrick's Cathedral, he was 25. Now
he is 75, and as he listened to the cardinal, he said he hoped his
own good health would last.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor seemed stronger Sunday than in recent months, standing
for much of the Mass and speaking in a steady voice.
</P>
<P>
   He also returned to using his trademark one-liners. His homily
lasted a little longer than usual, and he told the congregation:
``I'm sorry. I've just been told I'm talking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous giggles rose from the pews. The cardinal paused, then
added archly: ``This is a new phenomenon. Maybe it's a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation burst out in laughter and scattered applause.

SEATTLE SHOULD FORGET ABOUT OHIO ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What is it with these sons of Ohio and Seattle sports?
</P>
<P>
   First, Cincinnati native Ken Griffey Jr. can't stand it here.
Then, Joey Galloway of Columbus, a couple of hours upstate, is so
torqued with his circumstances that he squanders the first half of
a season, then drifts for the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Is it us? Our coffee breath? Too many puddles? Did they lose a
whole day trying to get on I-5 from Mercer?
</P>
<P>
   I was just in Ohio, and I failed to see the comparison to
Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   The state is jammed between Kentucky and Indiana, which is like
being married to Beavis AND Butthead. Then I think about the
Bengals and Browns, and my head hurts. How about those Cavaliers,
with Indiana native-turned-Macy's-balloon Shawn Kemp?
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland once lit afire its river, and Cincinnati natives
sometimes refer to their burg as Porkopolis. All you need to know
about cultural enlightenment is that Cincinnatians can forgive Pete
Rose anything but will tolerate nothing from photographer Robert
Mappelthorpe. And let's not even bother with Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   Please, Ohioans, save the nasty letters and e-mails. You're nice
folks. I've been treated well every visit. But for Seattle to get
hosed twice in five days by big-time Ohio athletes, well, the
crankiness must be worked through.
</P>
<P>
   One remarkable development from last week was how much money was
left on the tables in order to make the escapes from the Northwest
horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's willingness to take about $26 million less from the
Reds than the Mariners offered has left some baseball jaws
slackened. In a similar vein, although not to the same degree,
Galloway was willing to accept $215,000 in fines and $837,000 in
lost salary to get what he wanted from the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   He got it _ a trade to a team willing to pay him his original
contract demand of $42 million over seven years, with a $12.5
million signing bonus. The Seahawks had offered $35 million over
seven years, with a $7 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The different economic rules of baseball and football required
different tactics, but one result was the same _ they whacked their
old teams.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey bludgeoned the Mariners partly because the baseball
system is weighted so heavily in favor of player rights. The
10-and-5 rule is unique to baseball, and in hindsight, it appears
Griffey had been laying for it for years.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, the system is weighed heavily in favor of the teams.
Which makes Galloway's achievement all the more remarkable. The
holdout and subsequent poor play did not prevent him from gaining a
guaranteed $5.5 million upgrade in the bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Since he didn't care about Seattle or his teammates, his
strategy must be said to have worked.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Seahawks would seem to have made out better than
the Mariners, because they received two first-round draft picks
from the Cowboys while the Mariners picked up four players of
exceedingly modest skills.
</P>
<P>
   But as valuable as first-round NFL picks are on paper, they are
still unknown quantities; futures, not realities. Galloway was a
proven gamebreaker, although he never quite lived up to his
potential, even before the past season.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest virtue the Galloway transaction provided the
Seahawks was relief against the salary cap, where they are
squeezed. Although there is no salary cap in baseball, the
Mariners' biggest virtue in the Griffey transaction was also
payroll relief, a chance to use his 2000 salary of $8.5 million
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But just try to wrap your sports heart around a balance sheet,
or a cap strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Mariners and Seahawks will survive, and so will
fans. Player movement has always been a part of pro sports. Only
the naive assume loyalty is a big factor.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean a sense of rejection isn't legitimate. Seattle
fans nowadays not only invest their emotions, ticket and souvenir
money in the players and teams, they have committed $717 million in
tax money, plus interest, to house in opulent fashion these
franchises _ more public money than any market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks about that during a ninth-inning home run or a
game-winning touchdown catch. In those moments, ``our'' guys have
just made us enormously happy and proud. An affinity is usually
irresistible. That affection is the foundation of the
spectator-sports industry.
</P>
<P>
   But because sports are all about emotion and little about common
sense, when good, popular players leave, the hurt is sincere. When
the departures leave holes virtually impossible to fill, the hurt
gets wrapped in anger.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Galloway can make narrow business and personal
arguments for doing what they did. Those arguments don't do
anything to fix a sense of abandonment and betrayal, nor do they
repair damage to the franchises.
</P>
<P>
   As the calendar works to dissipate those consequences, it would
be shrewd of the Seahawks and Mariners to pass on any new players
from Dayton or Akron.

CITY COUNCIL DEMOCRATS PLAN TO DARE A GIULIANI VETO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the next few weeks, Democrats in the City
Council, led by Speaker Peter Vallone, are planning to approve a
barrage of legislative initiatives that have been strongly opposed
by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, all but daring the mayor to use his veto
powers.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing the bills, some of which have been in committee for
years, the Democratic majority in the council is deliberately
putting itself on a collision course with Giuliani, a Republican,
at a time when he is eager to portray himself as collaborative and
well suited to the U.S. Senate.
 &UR;  &LR;  Democrats, including some council members and Giuliani's Senate
campaign opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have been just as eager
to portray him otherwise: as an angry autocrat who would be out of
place in the Senate, where political compromise is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The administration maintains that Giuliani's success as a
Republican mayor in a heavily Democratic city is evidence that he
can work cooperatively.
</P>
<P>
   But the council's legislative blitz also reflects a changed
political landscape. As Giuliani runs for Senate and Vallone
prepares to run for mayor next year, the interests of the city's
two most powerful officials have diverged sharply and policy
differences between them have become more stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of frustration with negotiating in good faith for the
last six or seven months and coming up nowhere,'' said Bruce R.
Bender, Vallone's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Among the council initiatives are bills that would establish
grievance procedures for workfare participants and create a new
transitional jobs program, change some rules that govern the city's
public markets and begin an intense voter registration drive.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the bills would protect workfare recipients from
losing benefits over petty disputes, offer a strong mechanism for
job training and bring more equity to public markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani has expressed outspoken opposition to most of the
measures, calling the grievance procedures unnecessary, the
transitional jobs program a reversal of welfare reform, and the
public markets bill an effort to soften his stance against
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   And one senior mayoral aide charged Sunday that the coordinated
action on the bills had been orchestrated by Harold M. Ickes, the
former White House deputy chief of staff who is Clinton's top
political adviser and also a paid political consultant for the
council.
</P>
<P>
   Council officials rejected the charge, saying the bills were
good government policy and pointing out that the measures had been
in the works long before anyone knew who was running for Senate.
And, they said, the measures have been amended to address some of
the mayor's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Senior council officials said Sunday that they were still hoping
to reach a deal with the mayor, but that they were committed to the
legislation and were prepared to override a veto if necessary.
Giuliani administration officials declined to speculate on whether
the mayor would issue any vetoes, saying they doubted the the bills
would even come out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration officials did not react with the vehement
anger toward the council that they had expressed in the past,
suggesting that Giuliani was not looking for a fight and that they
might be willing to talk. The question is whether the council will
give them time.
</P>
<P>
   Council hearings on the bills are scheduled this week _
transitional jobs Tuesday in the General Welfare Committee,
workfare grievance on Wednesday in the Governmental Operations
Committee and public markets on Thursday in the Economic
Development Committee.
</P>
<P>
   All three hearings are timed to allow the committees to approve
the bills and get them on the agenda for votes by the entire
council at its next full meeting on Feb. 29. Several council
officials said they expected the bills to pass with the support of
Vallone.

GIULIANI VOWS MORE ATTENTION TO UPSTATE VOTE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said during a brief trip to
Long Island Sunday that he would eventually spend more time in
upstate New York campaigning for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been criticized in recent weeks by some Republican
leaders who say he has failed to pay enough attention to the
upstate region, which has a large number of undecided voters and is
considered critical to both Giuliani and his Democratic opponent,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop in Huntington, Giuliani restated his
commitment to being mayor, but as the campaign continues, he said,
he will certainly do more traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, as the campaign moves along, we will spend more
time campaigning,'' Giuliani said, before taking an opportunity to
poke fun at Clinton as a campaigner. ``But it will not be a
Hollywood-style campaign or approach to senator. It won't be a
royal tour of the state. It will be directly dealing with people's
problems and giving everything I have to try to solve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had a Sunday brunch with local Republican leaders at
the Golden Dolphin Diner in Huntington. (He ordered his standard
chicken Caesar salad.)
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to New York City, he called on President
Clinton to tap into some of the nation's oil reserves to bring down
the cost of home heating oil, which, he said, had more than tripled
in some parts of the state from the beginning of the year.

LORD KITCHENER, 77, CALYPSO SONGWRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lord Kitchener, whose sly wit and graceful melodies made him one
of Trinidad's most beloved calypso songwriters, died Feb. 11 at a
hospital in Port of Spain, Trinidad. He was 77 and lived in Diego
Martin, just outside Port of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a severe infection brought on by a blood disorder,
said his manager, Isaac McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Kitchener, whose real name was Aldwyn Roberts, wrote party
tunes and pointed political statements, risque songs and reminders
of heritage and history, singing in a voice that always seemed to
convey a dapper wink. His songs were esteemed for their tunes as
well as for their humor. He linked calypso to Afro-Cuban rhythms
and jazz, and his tunes were regularly arranged for steel bands,
winning competitions as instrumentals.
</P>
<P>
   He carried calypso abroad, spreading its influence to Jamaica
and Ghana and establishing himself as a recording star in Britain.
At Trinidad's annual carnival contests his songs won the Road March
award (for the song played and sung most often by parading carnival
groups) 10 times and won the Panorama steel-drum orchestra
competition 18 times, more than any other songwriter. He had hits
for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Aldwyn Roberts was born in Arima, Trinidad. His father, a
blacksmith, taught him the rudiments of guitar and calypso, then
called kaiso, which had taken hold in Trinidad in the 1920s. When
Aldwyn was 14 the death of his parents forced him to drop out of
school. His first paying job was to entertain the employees of the
water company as they laid pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts had his first local hit, ``Shops Close Too Early,'' in
1938, and he was named calypso king of Arima in the local carnival
competition from 1938 to 1942, before he moved to Port of Spain.
There he joined a group called the Roving Brigade, which performed
in movie houses around the city. He was hired by the promoter for
the Victory Tent, a calypso performance club, where he made $1 a
night working alongside top calypsonians including Growling Tiger,
Roaring Lion and Attila the Hun.
</P>
<P>
   His first major hit, in 1944, was ``Green Fig,'' a husband's
complaint that his cheating wife would not even cook him a good
meal. Growling Tiger renamed him Lord Kitchener, after the English
field marshal and war secretary. He became a steady hit maker,
entertaining American troops as well as Trinidadians; he performed
``Green Fig'' for President Harry S. Truman when he visited
Trinidad in 1945. In 1947 he opened his own calypso tent to feature
what he called the Young Brigade, dedicated to peppier,
horn-driven, Latin-tinged calypso songs that played down politics
in favor of teasing double-entendres.
</P>
<P>
   But after winning the carnival competition in 1947, Lord
Kitchener left Trinidad. He performed in Aruba and stayed for six
months in Jamaica, then moved to London, where he was a sensation.
He sometimes worked at three clubs in a night. Lord Kitchener
recorded for the Parlophone and Melodisc labels, and he sang for
Princess Margaret at the Chesterfield Club. Some of his songs, like
``White and Black'' and ``Africa My Home,'' protested the racism he
met in Britain; others were more playful.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Manchester in the north of England, and opened his
own club. He toured the United States in the mid-1950s, and even as
an expatriate he continued to have hits in Trinidad. When he toured
in Africa his music was embraced in Ghana, where calypso became an
influence on high-life music.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years abroad Lord Kitchener returned to Trinidad in
1963 and won the Road March competition three years running, as
well as in 1967 and 1968; he won five more Road Marches from 1970
to 1976. As instrumentals his tunes won the Panorama contest in
1964 and every year from 1967 to 1977, with three more Panorama
winners in both the 1980s and the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``His songs were structured for the steel band,'' said Ralston
Charles, the owner of Charlie's Records, who produced Lord
Kitchener's 1978 hit ``Sugar Bum Bum,'' one of the first
international hits in the modernized calypso style called soca.
``That's where he gathered all his fame.''
</P>
<P>
   He started the Calypso Revue tent in 1964, and with it he became
a mentor to leading calypsonians of the younger generations. When
soca sped up calypso and cut back on its lyrics, Lord Kitchener
embraced it as a legacy of what his Young Brigade had done decades
earlier. He was inducted into calypso's Sunshine Awards Hall of
Fame in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark suit, tie and fedora, he performed
regularly into the 1990's, including annual appearances at the
Mother's Day and Father's Day all-star calypso shows in New York
City. ``I've tried to make calypso more intelligent and make soca
more danceable,'' he said in an interview with Billboard magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 a petition drive urged the government of Trinidad and
Tobago to award Lord Kitchener its highest civilian honor, the
Trinity Cross. When the government chose instead to present him
with a lesser award, he turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons and two daughters. One, Kernel
Roberts, is a singer who continues to perform Lord Kitchener's
songs at the Calypso Revue, his club in Port of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The Trinidad government offered to give Lord Kitchener an
official funeral. But his family rejected the ceremony, The
Trinidad Express reported on Saturday. ``Kitch is a man of the
people, and the ordinary man must have the opportunity, if he
doesn't have a suit, to come to the funeral,'' Rose Janniere, a
friend of the family, told the newspaper.

PROVING SOCIALITE'S MURDER, WITHOUT A BODY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) (ms) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With 125 witnesses but no body, prosecutors are to
begin their complex circumstantial case Monday against Sante and
Kenneth Kimes, the mother and son accused of killing a wealthy
widow in a plot to steal her Upper East Side mansion.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, 1998, Irene Zambelli Silverman, a socialite,
disappeared. The Kimeses, tenants in her East 65th Street town
house, were arrested and charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators have never found Silverman's body or any
witnesses to her death. That missing evidence will profoundly shape
and lengthen the trial, being held in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors will try to throw as much against the wall as they
can and see if it sticks,'' said David Yellen, a visiting law
professor at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Besides second-degree murder, the Kimeses are charged with
fraud, conspiracy, robbery, larceny, forgery, weapons possession
and eavesdropping, among other crimes. If convicted of all charges,
each could be sentenced to 1311/3 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that after Kimes, 24, rented a room in
Silverman's town house, Kimes, 64, followed her son to New York
from Florida and began forging documents, tapping phones and
hatching schemes to learn Silverman's Social Security number and
secretly gain ownership of the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers plan to argue that Silverman, who was 82 when
she disappeared, is simply missing, not murdered.

   OK, so that was the big joke in the locker room before the West
bullied the Eastern Conference in a 137-126 victory Sunday at the
Arena in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   When the West's front line of Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett
and Tim Duncan finished decimating a considerably smaller East
squad inside, the punch line to the NBA's 49th All-Star Game was
simple:
</P>
<P>
   Size matters, a lot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, Duncan and Garnett combined for 70 points and 33
rebounds, and that was all the West needed to snap a four-game
All-Star losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in here arguing before the game because Kevin wanted
to play the point,'' starting West point guard Jason Kidd said,
smiling. ``That's a monster front line. And all of those guys can
handle the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the Triple Towers are more of an authority when
it comes to finishing plays.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and O'Neal were the most dominant players on the floor
and shared the game's Most Valuable Player award. They were
primarily the reasons Kidd collected a game-high 14 assists in
front of his hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Oakland native and Sonics guard Gary Payton came off the
bench for the West and dished out eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   The West, which won the midseason classic for just the 18th
time, had a simple gameplan. If the fastbreak or spectacular play
wasn't available, just lob the ball to the middle. Something good
or earth-shattering was bound to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The West outscored the East, 86-54, in the paint and finished
with a 58-46 edge in rebounds. No one on the East had more than
eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a battle of size versus quickness,'' said Duncan, who
missed just two of 14 shots and grabbed 14 rebounds. ``There's so
much talent on both sides. And on this given day, the size won.
Hopefully, (the power) keeps swinging to the West side because we'd
love to keep on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The West roster had seven players 6-foot-9 or taller, with
Duncan (7-foot), O'Neal (7-1) and David Robinson (7-1) the biggest
giants. Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo (7-2) was the only man who
matched up for the East, which had just three players over 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing in the NBA is not one dominant player,''
Garnett said. `` ... And the big man has transcended the game,
handling the ball and having a 6-11 guy in the small forward
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who felt as though he was overlooked for MVP at the 1996
All-Star Game in San Antonio, played as if he were on a mission. He
converted 11 of 20 field goals and didn't play in the fourth
quarter. O'Neal also got a rise out of the crowd in the second
quarter when he dribbled the length of the court and scooped in a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of his other scores were dunks. O'Neal said he
wasn't trying to win the MVP as much as he was making a statement
about where he intends to be in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice and exciting. I'll be a part of history,'' said
O'Neal, who also had fun converting a 360-degree dunk on one
fastbreak. ``But the big-picture award (NBA championship) is the
award I'm really looking for. If we would not have won today, I
still would have moved on. I moved on in San Antonio when you (the
media) gave it to Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan attended Sunday but only as a spectator. And even he
would not have made a difference for the East this time.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, the league scoring leader, was
Jordanesque in his first all-star appearance, finishing with a
game-high 26 points. And when Iverson wasn't scoring, he tried to
set up Toronto leaper Vince Carter for highlight reel dunks and
finished with nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys did a great job of finishing when I gave them passes,
and they didn't take anything away from my game,'' Iverson said.
``A lot of guys were so unselfish, they wanted to bring the ball
down and have me run off screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the East made several runs, its only lead was 97-95
late in the third quarter. And that was brief. Duncan immediately
tied the game with a thunderous dunk, and Chris Webber put back a
Payton miss for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The West took control for good with a 20-9 run to start the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a historical front line, there,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the West's smaller players were nonfactors. Kidd had
the most assists in an All-Star game since Payton recorded 15 in
1995. The game also marked the first time Payton and Kidd played
together professionally in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Payton actually ignited Kidd's game when he came off the bench
in the first quarter and set up Kidd for two open jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get him in the flow,'' Payton said. ``He
didn't take a shot until I got in there. So I drew the double team
and got the ball to him. He started to look more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton didn't look to score, but he is the most accomplished
Oakland product in the NBA. That was confirmed when Payton received
the loudest ovation of any player during pregame introductions.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much chance Payton and Kidd would share MVP. They
were on the floor together for a total of six minutes in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Karl Malone and John Stockton get (co-MVP) in Salt Lake
City, and getting it here would have been awesome,'' Kidd said.
``But it didn't put a damper on the weekend. We won, we stopped our
losing streak and we had a lot of fun. That was the key.''

CONSUMER GROUP OFFERS DATA ON THE VOLUME OF SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For the first time, consumers can learn how often
a particular doctor or hospital in New York performs a certain type
of surgery, in what consumer advocates call an important step
toward arming patients with the information they need to shop for
health care.
</P>
<P>
   A small nonprofit group, the Center for Medical Consumers,
compiled the numbers from data collected on every hospital patient
by the State Health Department. It chose 21 common surgical
procedures, like mastectomy and knee replacement, and determined
how many of each were performed at each hospital, and by each
doctor, across the state in 1998. The center will release the
numbers at a news conference Monday, but they were posted Friday on
its Web site, www.medicalconsumers.org.
</P>
<P>
   Although the numbers can point toward doctors and hospitals with
experience in a field, even advocates acknowledge that the figures
are no better than a crude indicator of expertise, and critics in
state government and the health care industry warn against making
judgments based on volume.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and state officials both say that what is needed
is a far more detailed evaluation of hospitals and doctors that
takes into account how sick each patient was before treatment, and
the outcome of each patient's case _reports that are years away, if
they are ever produced at all.
</P>
<P>
   For years, consumer groups have called on the state to release
information on the volume of procedures. But the Health Department,
concerned about misinterpretation of the data and caught in a
political tussle between those groups and the health care industry,
has refused.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have shown that in areas of health care, like heart
surgery and breast cancer treatment, volume correlates with
expertise; in other words, patients tend to fare best when treated
by the doctors and hospitals who treat their ailments most often.
Still, the release of the data on volume remains controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong correlation between volume and better
outcomes,'' said Arthur A. Levin, director of the center. ``What
startled me about the numbers was that for many procedures, a high
percentage are being done by physicians who do one, two, three of
these a year, not the ones who are doing 50, 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups like Levin's have long pressed the Health
Department to use its vast collection of data to compile detailed
report cards on hospitals and doctors, showing, say, survival rates
for everything from prostate cancer to hepatitis, hospital by
hospital and doctor by doctor. Such an undertaking would be
enormous, requiring that each case be adjusted by myriad risk
factors, like smoking, obesity or blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 state law required the Health Department to produce such
reports for each hospital. (After considerable lobbying by the
Medical Society of the State of New York, the main doctors' group,
the law prohibited the department from producing such reports on
doctors.) The state created a task force, which included Levin, to
advise it on the hospital reports, but it has made little progress
toward producing them.
</P>
<P>
   The department long resisted any form of public disclosure of
the information, in part because doctor and hospital groups wanted
it kept confidential, contending that some of their members would
be unfairly tainted. The state would not even release the raw,
patient-by-patient data for outside analysis until forced to by a
court order obtained several years ago by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Some detailed information on hospital performance is available,
but it is spotty. The state publishes annual hospital report cards
for cardiac surgery. Some private groups have analyzed other areas
of hospital performance, and hospitals sometimes publish statistics
comparing themselves favorably with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates have said that, short of producing report
cards on hospitals and doctors, the state should at least publish
the data on volume, to show which hospitals and doctors are
experienced at which procedures. But the department has resisted
this call, even though it has collected the information for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``To just put out volume data without taking patient risk
factors into account could possibly be misleading the public,''
said John Signor, a health department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that the state would not publish the information, Levin
and a colleague painstakingly combed through the information that
was released through The Times' lawsuit to produce the reports it
has published.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said that the information gave patients
the power to ask informed and important questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should make a decision based on volume alone,'' said
Horner, whose group is a leading advocate of releasing the data.
``But it allows you to ask intelligent questions. If your doctor
refers you to a surgeon, and you go on this Web site and find that
he's only done that surgery twice, you might want to go back to
your doctor and say, `Why should I go to this surgeon?'''
</P>
<P>
   But some experts are skeptical about how meaningful the data
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volume can be an indicator,'' said Dr. Mark R. Chassin, a
former state health commissioner. ``But it is at very best a weak
proxy for what one really wants, which is really valid data on
risk-adjusted outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital industry also reacted with caution. ``We definitely
recognize that volume is one important variable in judging the
quality of care,'' said Susan Waltman, senior vice president of the
Greater New York Hospital Association. But, she added, ``We
appreciate that the center itself has commented upon some of the
limitations of relying upon volumes of procedures.''

CLASH OF WILLS LED TO GALLOWAY'S DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Joey Galloway has the contract he wanted but
the Seahawks could not, and would not, give him. The Seahawks have
multiple picks in the first round of the NFL draft for the next two
years. The Dallas Cowboys have a receiver to replace Michael Irvin
and replenish owner Jerry Jones' ego.
</P>
<P>
   The blockbuster trade between the Seahawks and Cowboys
accomplished all of this Saturday, when Galloway collected a $12.5
million signing bonus as part of his seven-year, $42 million
contract with the Cowboys and the Seahawks acquired Dallas'
first-round draft choices this year and in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But left unanswered was this:
</P>
<P>
   How could Galloway, a player like no other the Seahawks had ever
had, become just another player they no longer have?
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of this relationship boiled down to a clash of
strong wills _ with coach and general manager Mike Holmgren in one
corner and Galloway in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Each tried to say the right things, during and after Galloway's
101-day holdout. But their body language spoke more clearly.
Galloway did not want to be a part of Holmgren's Seahawks,
especially at what he felt was the club's below-market price. And
as this eight-month ordeal was dragging into it its second
off-season, it was becoming increasingly clear to Holmgren that
Galloway could not stay.
</P>
<P>
   The final realization occurred during the postseason talks
Holmgren held with each of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting a little inkling in our exit interview, when
I really asked him to tell me how he was feeling about the whole
thing,'' Holmgren said after his news conference to announce
completion of the Galloway trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I want you here. You tell me how this is for you,'''
Holmgren said. ``This isn't prison. I don't want anyone feeling
that way. He was good about it, I don't think it was personal. But
that's when I first started thinking this was going to be the only
way to remedy the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   This revelation from that exit meeting, however, was rooted in
Galloway's refusal to enter the new world of the Seahawks _ the way
things are being done and will be done under Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren wants his players, as well as everyone else in the
league, to take him at his word. So when he told Galloway his new
deal would continue to be worked on after Galloway reported to
training camp, Holmgren expected to see the team's leading receiver
on the practice field at Eastern Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Galloway not only sat out all of training
camp and the entire preseason, but the first eight games of the
regular season. The lack of progress in the negotiations, and
things that were said and done during the prolonged impasse, only
served to further fray an already disentangled dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway wanted what he felt was a fair contract, and he felt
some vindication after finally getting it from the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, however, will not back down from his contention that
the Seahawks offered Galloway what he was worth, as well as his
conviction that the club will not overspend just because owner Paul
Allen has billionaire-deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiscally, we have to change. We have to make good decisions,
particularly on monies that are going to be accumulated down the
road,'' Holmgren said of the spending spree the past three
off-seasons that has left the club all but tapped out on its salary
cap. ``If we find a player we have to have _ (begin italic) have to
have (end italic) _ the numbers still have to make sense to me.
Certainly the resources here allow us to do that. But I also have
to be a good steward of Mr. Allen's money.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway is a proud person who felt disrespected by the
Seahawks' initial offer, and he became disgruntled by the hardline
stance the club took as his holdout went from days to weeks to
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Seattle deteriorated in so many ways,''
Galloway said. ``I'm glad that is behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the easiest way to explain all of this is the simple
fact that Holmgren never shared Galloway's appraisal of his
talents.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that Galloway's speed and uncanny ability to
explode into an extra gear while seemingly running at full throttle
are unmatched in the NFL. There was no comparison between the
numbers Galloway put up in his first four seasons (261 catches,
4,122 yards and 36 receiving touchdowns) and those of other players
who entered the league at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But to play in Holmgren's offense, a receiver also must be able
to block, turn a short catch over the middle into a long gain and
sell his routes when he is not the primary receiver.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that Galloway couldn't do these things. It was worse.
He seemed unwilling to do them.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, and countless others, Holmgren and Galloway
never reached a common ground. At least they finally realized they
never would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never did click,'' Holmgren said. ``People will say the
right thing after something like that. But it's one of those
unfortunate things where it never seems to be as good after it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides not only agreed to cut their losses, they were able
to turn them into significant gains.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY LET BAD COP SLIDE IN BEATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH AND BETH BARRETT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite blood-spattered walls and compelling
evidence gathered by police, the Los Angeles County District
Attorney's Office refused to prosecute a corrupt former Rampart
police officer who was fired for a vicious station-house beating, a
Daily News investigation has learned.
</P>
<P>
   On two separate occasions during the past 18 months, the
District Attorney's Office rejected requests from top LAPD
officials and detectives investigating the widening Rampart scandal
to bring criminal charges against former Officer Brian Hewitt,
according to documents obtained by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The documents for the first time reveal the scope of the
evidence compiled by LAPD detectives against Hewitt, including
samples of blood splattered on the walls of the Rampart Station,
which were matched to the victim's DNA; testimony from an emergency
room doctor detailing the victim's injuries; testimony from several
citizens and law enforcement personnel; and a piece of carpet from
the Rampart Station that is soaked with the victim's bloody vomit.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently have county prosecutors agreed to take another
look at what investigators and an LAPD disciplinary board called
the ``malicious and egregious'' treatment Hewitt inflicted upon a
handcuffed gangbanger in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The DA's previous handling of the case could prevent Hewitt from
ever being prosecuted effectively, sources close to the special
LAPD corruption task force said. Federal prosecutors also are
eyeing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The documents obtained by the Daily News raise questions about
the role of District Attorney Gil Garcetti's office's oversight of
police misconduct and its willingness to prosecute rogue cops.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus of the LAPD scandal until now has been on the
breakdown of internal discipline in the LAPD, which allowed
officers in the Rampart Division CRASH unit _ Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums _ to systematically violate the rights of
dozens of people. In this case, police initiated an immediate and
thorough investigation of the station-house attack and Chief
Bernard Parks fired Hewitt, acting on the recommendation of the
Board of Rights, a panel of officers who hear disciplinary cases.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office twice found the evidence
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons declined comment, saying
only that Hewitt's name has been mentioned recently as part of the
district attorney's ongoing investigation of several LAPD officers.
``We have several cases under investigation, and we're not going to
comment on any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti has been sharply criticized by his two opponents in the
March 7 primary over his 1996 decision to abandon the district
attorney's rollout team, which investigated police shootings. The
DA's challengers charge he is more concerned with re-election than
with playing a vigorous role in investigating the massive LAPD
corruption scandal. Garcetti has denied those accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt could not be reached and has denied that the beating took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Parks fired Hewitt last year for attacking Ismael Jimenez, a
muscular 18th Street Gang member with a long criminal rap sheet.
The chief acted on the recommendation of the Board of Rights, which
conducted a hearing on the matter last June. The board found Hewitt
guilty on six counts related to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a spokesman for Parks, said Sunday that
the department still believes Hewitt should be prosecuted.
``Obviously, we are very eager to move forward. We believe that we
have provided sufficient evidence for a criminal filing. However,
we certainly understand the DA's responsibility to proceed
strategically.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of abuse comes straight from the police dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   According to LAPD documents, Hewitt wrongfully arrested and
detained Jimenez in February 1998. After hauling Jimenez and a
friend to the Rampart detectives station, Hewitt punched the
gangbanger in the chest and stomach repeatedly, and choked him, the
official documents reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt also shoved Jimenez, while he was handcuffed, causing his
head to strike the interview room wall. Following the attack,
Jimenez vomited at least four times and sought treatment at a
nearby hospital, where a doctor noted his injuries, records
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is one of many current and former LAPD Rampart anti-gang
officers identified by corrupt-cop-turned-informant Rafael Perez as
being involved in abusing and framing innocent people for crimes
between 1995 and 1998. Perez agreed to talk to investigators in
exchange for a lenient sentence for stealing cocaine from an LAPD
evidence locker.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the probe said Hewitt remains under
investigation for possible criminal misconduct, including a July
1996 shooting described by Perez as dirty.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office issued a report to the LAPD in
March stipulating its reasons for not prosecuting Hewitt for the
Jimenez beating. The county prosecutors concluded that there was
``insufficient evidence'' to prove in court that Hewitt assaulted
Jimenez. The office argued there were no witnesses, except possibly
another gang member, and no photographs of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major reasons cited by the District Attorney's Office
for not putting Hewitt on trial were rejected by the LAPD Board of
Rights last June when Hewitt was fired, newly obtained documents
reveal.
</P>
<P>
   The board reportedly made its decision not on the basis of the
testimony of Jimenez or Hewitt, but on the physical evidence and
statements from several witnesses, including the emergency room
doctor, the hospital's security guard, a man who saw Jimenez vomit
outside the station house, and an LAPD criminalist who analyzed the
evidence and DNA results. Sources close to the LAPD investigation
also said photographs clearly showing Jimenez's injuries were
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD disciplinary board concluded: ``We see these as
mistakes of the heart in that striking or physically punishing a
handcuffed prisoner is a malicious and egregious act that cannot be
mitigated in any way.''

SAFETY BOARD SAYS ALASKA AIR PUT OFF FIXING WORN PART 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 1st and 6th grafs to clarify that inspections were done by
airline ; ADDS 5 grafs at end with background) 
 (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Transportation Safety Board said
Sunday night that a part of the tail assembly on the Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed last month had been found by the airline
to be worn and in need of replacement in September 1997, but that
the airline later decided it was good enough to keep in use.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly in question is a jack screw, a rotating screw that
looks like the ones used to move a garage door up and down, and a
nut that connects to the screw. When the screw turns, the nut rides
up and down, moving the horizontal stabilizer, which makes the nose
of the plane point up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crash, which killed all 88 people aboard, the cockpit
crew radioed to mechanics on the ground that they were having
problems with the stabilizer. And when the Navy recovered the jack
screw and nut from the waters off Los Angeles, the screw was partly
stripped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not said whether they think this was a cause
or a result of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   During major maintenance checks, mechanics hold the nut still
and push the screw up and down to check for ``end play,'' a measure
of wear.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board chairman, James Hall, said in a statement
Sunday evening that when the airline last performed a major
maintenance of the plane, at a hangar in Oakland, Calif., mechanics
initially noted that the assembly had reached the allowable limit
of its end play.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said, ``the initial planned action was to replace the nut''
during the inspection. But according to the maintenance records, he
said, the next day ``this initial planned action was re-evaluated
and the assembly was re-inspected.''
</P>
<P>
   The second inspection found that the part was within normal
tolerances, he said; according to the records the assembly ``was
re-checked five times with the same result.'' So the plane, an
MD-82, went back out with the same jack screw assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the board would study the maintenance of the rest of
the plane as well as of the stabilizer system from the time the
plane was manufactured, in 1992, until the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which last week ordered
emergency inspections of all MD-80s and similar airplanes, said
that 15 planes, including four at Alaska Airlines, may show signs
of problems. Of the others, four were at Delta, two at Airtran (the
airline formerly known as ValuJet), and one each at American,
Continental, TWA, Northwest and Hawaiian Air.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have until midday Monday to finish inspections, and
until Wednesday to report, although many have already finished. The
FAA is also anticipating hearing later this week from foreign
airlines, which are not bound by its rules but will probably
perform the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA order will also permanently shorten the time interval
allowed between inspections of the jack screw assembly, to every
650 hours of flying time, or about every three months, said Eliot
Brenner, a spokesman for the agency. He said the previous rules
allowed planes to fly about eight months between inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Garvey, the administrator of the agency, said in an
interview on CNN Sunday morning, ``Obviously, in light of the
accident, we're taking a very, very careful look with the NTSB at
the maintenance records, at the procedures that they have in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   A Federal grand jury has been looking into allegations of
maintenance irregularities at the Oakland, Calif., hangar where the
airline maintains its MD-80s, but is not examining records from the
plane that crashed, according to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   While the cause of the crash is still unknown, the case is
causing the most widespread emergency inspections of jetliners
since the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, a Boeing 747,
in 1996. The crash led to findings of problems and then emergency
inspections on hundreds of another Boeing model, the 737.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the jack screw irregularities found by the
airlines in the last few days remains unknown.

INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT SUSPENDS ACCUSED GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS grafs   4-6 with quotes, background) 
 (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ President Abdurrahman Wahid on Sunday
backed away from his demand for the resignation of his defiant
security minister, General Wiranto, then turned around hours later
and suspended him.
</P>
<P>
   The confusing flip-flop came on the day the president returned
from a two-week foreign trip during which he had repeatedly urged
the general to step down but constantly changed the details and
emphasis of his statements.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unusual long-distance confrontation had created
uncertainty in Jakarta and in foreign financial markets. It had
raised questions over whether he was cleverly pressuring the
general and smoking out enemies or whether he was not in full
control of his own impulsive statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't change my mind,'' the president insisted to reporters
Monday morning. ``Yesterday I said that he will be examined by the
attorney general's office. Then after that he will resign. That
still applies.''
</P>
<P>
   But his Cabinet secretary, Marsi-H lam Simanjuntak, did call the
sus- pension a ``new decision,'' saying the president had decided
on the suspen- sion on Sunday night ``for the sake of the
government's stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The net result seemed to be that Wahid had succeeded in assert-
ing his dominance over the general but had reinforced doubts about
his own consistency and management style.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation with the country's most prominent military
figure also turned the president's policy of assertion of civilian
control into a dangerous crisis. It raised fears of a military
coup, fueled in part by Wahid's warnings. And it left in question
both Wahid's personnel policies and the steadiness of his
stewardship as president.
</P>
<P>
   His demands for resignation had followed a report by a local
investigating commission that said the general _ Indonesia's most
prominent military man _ should face trial for his part in
atrocities committed in East Timor last year in which hundreds of
people died.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unusual behavior went so far as ordering Defense
Minister Juwono Sudarsono _ technically Wiranto's subordinate _ to
tell the general to resign. But the president chose not to issue a
direct order to the general.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to this verbal onslaught, Wiranto refused to resign
until he could speak directly with the president.
</P>
<P>
   That moment came hours after Wahid returned early Sunday to
Jakarta, in a meeting that also included Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri and the attorney general, who is charged with
investigating the general.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid then met with reporters and said, ``I asked him to resign
but he said he preferred to be investigated by a legal process and
I said, `OK' We have to give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have the prerogative to replace my ministers. But
we abide by the law. If the results of the report implicate him,
then he must resign.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to an expected report by the attorney general,
Marzuki Darusman, on whether Wiranto should be put on trial for the
violence and destruction that followed East Timor's vote last
August for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late at night, the president again met with Wiranto,
emerging at midnight to tell a small group of reporters that he had
suspended the general pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians remained confused Monday by their garrulous
president, and some analysts said he may have devalued the power of
his word by constantly changing it and by failing to demand
obedience.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some analysts said, it was notable that
during two weeks of sparring, Wiranto failed to garner strong
support from within the military, with several prominent commanders
asserting their allegiance to civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have appeared weak or vacillating in
terms of his personal command, he did emphasize the supremacy of
law in the first of his statements Sunday, placing the general's
fate in the hands of the attorney general, placing the issue in the
hands of the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to change my ministers,'' the president said.
``But we have to abide by the law. If the results of the report
implicate him, then he must resign, as I have already said
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what he has said is that he wanted the general to
resign immediately, even before any results or preliminary findings
are made. But he has declined to exercise his right to fire his
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who see cunning in Wahid's seemingly off-the-cuff style
say it seems to have the effect of pummeling his targets in his
chosen direction with a mixture of verbal rabbit punches, jokes and
expressions of personal regard. He is a difficult man to understand
or to grapple with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem,'' Wahid said at his first news conference
Sunday. ``Wiranto and I are good friends. It is the media that
perceives us to be enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president must be held responsible for the perceptions
of the media, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political analyst who was
a top aide to former president B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks had created unnecessarily a sense of
nervousness and uncertainty, including a surge of coup rumors to
which Wahid had himself contributed directly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are the losers here,'' she said of the president and the
general. ``And it was quite unnecessary. And it could all have been
done in a more dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the president had stated that one reason he
wanted the general to resign was to strengthen confidence among
foreign investors and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect, in the short term at least, may have been the
opposite. Jakarta's stock exchange and the value of its currency
have slipped during the past two weeks and some analysts said they
expected further slippage in the coming week following the seeming
retreat by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his seemingly impulsive verbal fits and starts, however,
there is a consistent direction to the president's policies, toward
democracy, openness, tolerance and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to rule by fiat, Wahid is revolutionizing leadership
in Indonesia after 32 years of autocratic rule by former president
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   By delegating the outcome of his standoff with Wiranto to his
highly respected attorney general, the president seemed to be
subordinating both the executive and the military to the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
   But then on Sunday, in a style that continues to keep
Indonesians off balance, he seemed to have a late-night change of
mind.

LANDRY: MAN IN THE WHITE HAT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In Tom Landry's youth, Hollywood created cowboy heroes
in the cinemas. The heroes were good guys who wore white hats and
never did anything wrong. They were fictional.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, who died Saturday at age 75 after a magnificent life,
was real, the last true American cowboy hero. John Wayne, on the
big screen, represented what Tom Landry was really like in life.
Landry became a legendary figure in this country as the coach of
the highly successful Dallas Cowboys. Sports fans across the
country followed him on television as he developed the Cowboys into
America's Team, winning two Super Bowls, competing in three more,
and coaching the squad to 20 consecutive winning seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People watched him on television and thought he was stoic,''
said former Patriots general manager Bucko Kilroy, who played in
several Pro Bowls with Landry the player, and then worked in Dallas
with him for six years when Landry was starting his brilliant
coaching career. ``But he really wasn't. He was a man of great
principles. He had character, integrity, was very religious, and
treated everyone with respect. He also had a great sense of humor,
but he didn't show it that much to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry grew up in Mission, Texas, near the Mexican border, the
son of a fireman, not a cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   He went to war as a teenager, and was flying US bombers over
enemy territory in Europe during World War II before his 20th
birthday. He flew a bomber on 30 combat missions and was shot down
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's older brother, Bob, had been killed in the war before
Landry left the University of Texas, where he was an outstanding
two-way player, to fight for his country. Despite what most of us
now would call the ``Private Ryan Rule,'' under which a member of
the armed forces did not have to go into combat if one of his
siblings already had been killed, Tom Landry decided to fight the
fight. Years later, he was asked how he could balance bombing
people with his strong religious beliefs against violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fighting for my country and what I believed was right,''
said Landry, ``and I think God knew I was on the right side.''
</P>
<P>
   On one mission, Landry was forced to crash-land on the way back
to his base after his plane had taken some hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very lucky to be alive,'' he said. ``We really weren't
sure where we were. There was a thick ground fog where we had to
put the plane down. When we hit the ground, both wings were
stripped off the plane by trees. It just happened that where we
landed was on a farm and our path took us down a row of trees,
knocking off the wings but not doing anything to us.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Landry came home to a new adventure,
professional football. He played five years in New York and by the
age of 29 was named defensive coach of the Giants. The offensive
coach was a young college coach named Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   Together, under head man Jim Lee Howell, they built the
wonderful Giant teams of the 1950s that became the darlings of
football fans across New England in the days before the founding of
the Patriots in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the 1950s that Landry started to show signs of being
an exceptional coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cleveland Browns came into our league and no one could
stop them,'' Steelers owner Dan Rooney recalled Sunday morning,
just hours after Landry died in a Texas hospital after a two-year
battle with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a great offense with Otto Graham, Mac Speedie, Dante
Lavelli, Marion Motley. We had an off week in our schedule so I
went over with our coach, Walt Kiesling at the time, to scout a
game in Cleveland. They were playing the Giants, and Tom was the
defensive coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The game became a milestone contest in the history of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landry threw a new defense at Cleveland that day, and shut
them down,'' said Rooney. ``The Giants won in a big upset. Tom had
devised the 4-3 defense, which is still used by most teams in the
league to this day. He did something no one had done before that,
dropped off his defensive ends and used four defensive backs, and
it worked great.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry developed some great defenders for the Giants, such as
Andy Robustelli and Sam Huff, both in the Hall of Fame. Huff gives
credit to Landry for saving his career. Huff was an unheralded
player out of West Virginia and was ready to quit in training camp
as a rookie when Landry talked him into staying and made him the
middle linebacker in his 4-3 alignment. In those days, many of the
players and coaches roomed in the same hotel near Yankee Stadium,
and at night Landry would go to Huff's room and spend hours
teaching him.
</P>
<P>
   Landry finally got his own acclaim when he was named head coach
of the Cowboys in 1960, a job he held for 29 years before being
unceremoniously fired by owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was once asked at a Super Bowl news conference the No. 1
reason he had success in Dallas. When he answered ``a great
owner,'' some of the members of the media started to laugh. But
Landry was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win a game the first year I coached,'' he said. ``And
we didn't have a winning year the first six years I coached. One
time there was a lot of talk that I was going to be fired, so Clint
Murchison (the Cowboys' original owner) called a press conference
to announce that he was giving me a new 10-year contract. There
aren't many owners that would have done that with the record we
had.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 on, Landry's Cowboys became the force to be reckoned
with in the National Football League. He amassed 270 victories,
third most in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom was coaching the Giants, Cleveland was the team to
beat,'' said NFL vice president of public relations Greg Aiello,
who spent 10 years with Landry in Dallas before moving to the
league office in New York. ``Tom really admired Paul Brown.coached the game in a suit, tie, hat. Tom dressed the same way, and
had the same sideline demeanor his whole career. Bill Walsh later
said when he started the San Francisco dynasty that he tried to
build his team to beat the Cowboys, and Tom Landry, because he knew
if they wanted to win it all, that's what they had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry dominated Dallas for a quarter-century, but even he did
not know the extent to which he had affected the lives of Cowboys
fans until he was fired, and the city of Dallas had a parade in his
honor. Some 100,000 people turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the greatest experiences of my life,'' said
Landry. ``To see all of those people, holding signs, yelling out
nice things, got me all choked up. I never experienced anything
like that in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was fired, Landry asked for one last chance to address
his team. He was fired in the offseason and the players were on
vacation. When they returned, he talked to them in the locker room
to thank them for what they had done for him and to wish them well
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got so emotional,'' said Aiello, who was there at the time,
``that Tom couldn't finish. He couldn't get through it. He loved
players. When he coached, he had troubles with some players that
all coaches have, but when they retired, they would always say
great things about him for what he had done for them. He taught
them football. He taught them discipline. And he lived the way he
talked. No one ever called him Tom. We all had great respect for
him, we always called him Coach Landry, even when he wasn't
around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys like me get to paying tribute to those who came
before us, Tom Landry is at the top of that list,'' Bill Parcells
of the Jets said Sunday. ``He was a tremendous person. He was one
of the great innovators in the history of the game, both on offense
(designing the multiple offense) and defense. He was the kind of
coach that every young coach coming along in the league looked up
to. Coaches like him and Don Shula, Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown,
Chuck Noll made it so much easier for guys like me who followed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeOssie, who spent five years with Dallas after being a
fourth-round draft choice out of Boston College, credits Landry
with saving his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a great training camp my first year because I
had played well in all of the preseason games,'' he said. ``The
final exhibition game against Oakland, I had an interception, a
sack, and made eight tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``On cut day, Landry called me into his office and said, `Son,
what will you do if you don't play pro football?' I went into his
office thinking he was going to tell me I was starting and now he
was talking like he was going to cut me. When I got the lump out of
my throat I told him I'd have to go get a job and support my
family. He told me I was heading in that direction, and if I didn't
practice better, I wouldn't make it in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that day forward, I practiced so hard the other guys
started to get mad at me. Coach Landry was an exacting coach. He
left nothing to chance. Everything was worked on in detail. He was
a fine man. I was in that final meeting when he came to say goodbye
to the players, and everyone in the room choked up with emotion. I
think every player had tears in his eyes. We all were thinking this
is not the way for Coach Landry to end it. He was such a man of
distinction, had so much class, we knew it wasn't right and that's
why it hit all of us so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, this reporter was at a Miami playoff game in
Jacksonville. The great Bob Hayes, known as the world's fastest
human in the 1960s when he won gold medals in the sprints in the
Olympics, was sitting in the back of the press box. Hayes played
for the Cowboys and Landry when he finished college, and even
though he had been down on his luck since retiring, he and Landry
had stayed in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Landry is very sick, you know,'' he said in passing.
``Talked to him on the phone the other day, his voice was so weak I
could barely hear him.'' When I said that was too bad, Hayes
replied, ``Don't worry about Coach Landry. God's got a special
place for him.''

</HEADLINE>
 GAME-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ You know the tired cliche to the effect that
``We have seen the future of X and it is blah, blah, blah, etc.?''
</P>
<P>
   This time you can believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century of NBA basketball is here in the form of the
starting Western Conference front line, a frightening assemblage of
tall, agile, and intelligent players who Sunday demonstrated their
wondrous skills in front of 18,325 Bay Area fans and a worldwide
television audience, leading their team to a 137-126 triumph over
the East in a very entertaining All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   So awe-inspiring were Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, and Kevin
Garnett, 7-footers all, that ordinary superlatives were completely
inadequate. Never mind that their totals of 70 points, 33 rebounds,
12 assists and 62 percent shooting (33 for 53) represented the
greatest statistical day any starting All-Star frontcourt ever has
had. It was about more than the numbers. It was about power (Shaq),
grace (Garnett), and versatility (Duncan) in physical packages that
never have been seen to this degree in the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The only good thing for the rest of the league is that when the
game was over the trio had been disbanded. Imagine if they somehow
were placed on the same team for 82 regular-season games and given
the benefit of one style of coaching and a mandate to play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be scary,'' opined none other than Bill Russell, a
frontcourt observer. ``You know how I always used to say, `Well,
the game is on the schedule, so you might as well play it?' In this
case I'd say, `Take the game off the schedule.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy,'' said Golden State coach Garry St. Jean with a sigh.
``Seventy wins.''
</P>
<P>
   East coach Jeff Van Gundy, who tried to find some way to combat
this majestic trio, thought 70 wins would be underachieving. ``It
would be a record for wins,'' he said. ``They may lose, but I don't
know who it would be. You've got Garnett, with his range, and who
can guard threes (i.e. small forwards) and even some twos (i.e.
shooting guards). You've got Duncan in the low post. You've got
Shaq. I could play point guard on that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny he should mention that. Complicating matters for the
undersized East team was that this dot.com-age frontcourt was being
directed by the game's best young choreographer. That would be
Phoenix guard Jason Kidd, who ooped and alleyed and shot a nice
assortment of passes to this guy and that to rack up a game-high 14
assists.
</P>
<P>
   The East actually hung in gamely through three periods. It was
64-59, West, at the half, and 99-97, West, after three, courtesy of
a falling-down, buzzer-beating putback by Sacramento's Chris
Webber. The East was not exactly impotent, not with potent
mid-sized weapons such as Ray Allen (14), Glenn Robinson (10), and
Slam Dunkmeister Vince Carter (12). And then there was the slithery
Allen Iverson, who led the East with 26 points and nine assists,
spending a great deal of his time at point guard, a position at
which he is, in theory, supposed to be an alien visitor. ``It was
easy,'' he said with a shrug. ``It's very easy when you're playing
with four All-Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   With the East contributing some unforced errors, the West pulled
away in the early stages of the fourth period, doing so with Shaq
on the bench nursing a banged-up shoulder. But when you've got
Duncan and Garnett, you're able to scrape by.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good show from the start. Before the game was five
minutes old, there had been two alley-oop dunks, an indescribable
Iverson spin-o-rama, and a vicious Shaq smash of a play-action
Iverson drive off the glass to start a West fast break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was one of the best All-Star Games in a while,''
said Rick Barry, MVP of the last All-Star Game held in these here
parts (1967). ``They fooled around a little, but you could tell
they all wanted to win, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The East players are no fools; they recognized what they were up
against in that phenomenal West front line. ``It was a pretty good,
exciting game,'' said Carter, ``but they were just too big for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Big is one thing. But big like this is another matter. ``There
have been some big frontcourts in All-Star Games before,'' said the
West's Phil Jackson, who became the first All-Star coach to wear a
campaign button (Bill Bradley, of course). ``What was it, 1984,
when Ralph Sampson was MVP playing alongside Kareem?'' (Close. It
was 1985). ``But there has never been a group this big and this
agile.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq is skipping the Sydney Olympics, so the 2001 All-Star Game
will be the next time we'll see Shaq, Duncan, and Garnett together.
Set the VCR now.

   SAN DIEGO _ Having made a pair of double-bogeys in the previous
six holes to let his comfortable lead slip away Sunday in the Buick
Invitational, Phil Mickelson walked slowly to his ball in the 13th
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   It was a par 5 he should have reached in two, but his drive
squirted left into wet rough near a tree, all he could do was punch
out, and now Mickelson was staring at his worst nightmare more than
a hundred yards ahead on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what everybody was thinking,'' said Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Which was: Tiger Woods was about to pull another rabbit out of
his hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was only one thing on my mind,'' said Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Which was: Pull a 9-iron out of his bag and make birdie.
</P>
<P>
   It was a soft shot from 116 yards, not a hard wedge because ``I
didn't want to spin it back off the green,'' and Mickelson landed
it to about 3 feet, an easy birdie that set off a series of shots
that put an end to Woods's pursuit of one of golf's greatest
records.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, settling his nerves down the stretch at Torrey
Pines's South Course, birdied four of the final six holes to shoot
a final-round 70 and halt Woods's streak of six straight victories.
The lefthander who grew up in this city and on this course finished
at 18-under 270, four clear of Woods (68) and Shigeki Maruyama
(72).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't dog it out there,'' said Woods, whose pursuit of
Byron Nelson's 11 straight victories had captivated the golf world.
``I am disappointed that I didn't win, but I'm proud of how I hung
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Woods, tied for fourth six shots off the lead to
start the day, had pulled square with Mickelson was unthinkable _
even to a guy who had stormed from seven back with seven holes to
play to win last week's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. ``I
mean, to even be under par with the way I was hitting the ball
today was a miracle,'' said Woods, who hit just six of 14 fairways
and 10 of 18 greens.
</P>
<P>
   But tied he was, thanks to his 6-foot birdie putt on that 13th
green as Mickelson stood down the fairway. It was Woods's second
straight birdie, his fifth of the day, and put him at 15 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew. Oh, yeah, I knew,'' said Mickelson, whose smile, so
visible earlier in the round, had turned to a stern, blank stare.
The smile had left, not so much because of Woods's birdie-birdie
effort at Nos. 12 and 13, but because of what he had done at the
par-4 seventh and par-3 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way (Woods) has played lately has generated a lot of
interest in golf,'' said Mickelson, ``but I certainly wasn't going
to hand him the tournament _ even though that's what it looked like
I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off three consecutive birdies to get to 19 under,
Mickelson was in the middle of the fairway at the 453-yard seventh,
holding a 5-iron, not to mention leads of six over Maruyama and
seven over Woods. He ballooned his shot left, the ball hitting the
slope next to the green and coming to rest near a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson tried to get cute, left his third shot in the rough,
then chipped 8 feet strong with his fourth. He missed the putt for
bogey and brought Woods back into the picture. Maruyama, too,
though Mickelson's playing partner went out in 37, didn't make a
birdie till the 13th, and was never the threat Woods was.
</P>
<P>
   At the 207-yard 11th, Mickelson pulled his tee shot left and
short, into thick rough. Again, he applied finesse, not reason, and
left his flop shot in the rough to set up another double-bogey. ``I
should have just knocked those shots on the green and taken
bogey,'' said Mickelson. ``I gave back two (each hole) when I
should have given back just one.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with an arsenal of skills that are unmatched, Woods does
not need charity _ but he gratefully accepted the life Mickelson
granted him. Then he decided to take things into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   At the 468-yard 12th, Woods drove into rough again but chopped a
161-yard 8-iron to 6 feet for his fourth birdie of the day. He was
14 under, one back.
</P>
<P>
   After Mickelson saved par at the 12th and exchanged birdies with
Woods at the 13th, the duel seemingly was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not won in a while (August, 1998),'' said Mickelson,
``and it was important for me to win again. It was important for me
to go head-to-head against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the best'' was not at his best on this day. Woods said he
was fighting swing problems all day and there was plenty of
evidence to support his claim. His first drive of the day, in fact,
was pulled left into the gallery. That it hit a chair, bounced in
the fairway, and set up a birdie was a nice break, said Woods, but
indicative of the way things would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't hitting the ball well enough to catch up. It finally
caught up to me,'' said Woods, who came over the top of a 9-iron
approach from 129 yards on the 14th. From the back of the green
down a slippery slope, Woods rolled it 7 feet strong and missed the
comebacker for his first bogey of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, his mind set again on attacking pins, split the
fairway at 14, knocked a wedge to 5 feet, and made the birdie to go
to 17 under, three strokes up. Comfortable? Hardly, said Mickelson,
though Woods made it a bit more so with a bogey on the par-3 16th
after burying a 4-iron under the lip of a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson also bogeyed 16, but said he felt in control. He
showed it, too, with a birdie-birdie finish that took Woods's magic
act out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mickelson's 14th PGA Tour win, his second here in front
of the home fans, and proved that Woods, despite what recent events
had indicated, is not unbeatable. Was he proud that he was the one
to stop the streak?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Mickelson. ``I would be proud if I could be
the guy who had that six-tournament streak.''
</P>

LAPD EVIDENCE NOT ENOUGH FOR PROSECUTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT AND GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the moment an LAPD sergeant got the initial
report that Rampart Officer Brian Hewitt viciously beat a
handcuffed prisoner to the day Chief Bernard Parks fired him, the
LAPD vigorously investigated the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, however, was never prosecuted because the same evidence
used to fire him was deemed insufficient by the District Attorney's
Office to bring criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 26, 1998, only four days before
dirty-cop-turned-informant Rafael Perez stole cocaine from an LAPD
evidence room, Ismael Jimenez staggered into Good Samaritan
Hospital's emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Ashen and crying, Jimenez _ a burly, tattooed gangbanger _ had
been in a Rampart Division detectives' interview room less than an
hour earlier, according to records obtained by the Daily News from
the LAPD and the District Attorney's Office. The documents provide
the first detailed account of the case and the actions of the LAPD
and District Attorney's Office in handling that.
</P>
<P>
   Official LAPD reports said Jimenez told the physician,
identified as Dr. Brian Harris, that Hewitt had punched him in the
chest and stomach and grabbed him by the neck. Harris scribbled
Hewitt's name on the hospital bedsheet, noting Jimenez said the cop
attacked him.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor noticed that Jimenez's chest was red and observed
marks on Jimenez's neck consistent with finger marks. Jimenez then
vomited.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a security guard who saw Jimenez enter the
hospital holding his side listened to him detail the attack. The
guard called the Rampart Station, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   A Rampart sergeant arrived at the hospital and interviewed
Jimenez and then took him to the station for questioning. Before
leaving the hospital, Jimenez, still emotional, refused to allow
doctors to insert a long tube down his throat to determine whether
he was bleeding internally.
</P>
<P>
   At the station house, Jimenez told the sergeant that he and his
friend Eduardo Hernandez were arrested hours earlier by Hewitt and
another cop outside a tattoo parlor. He said they were doing
nothing wrong _ a contention the LAPD Board of Rights would later
support.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jimenez, Hewitt refused to release him from the
Rampart detectives office unless he helped the police find a gun.
</P>
<P>
   When the handcuffed Jimenez balked, he said, Hewitt grabbed him
by the neck and began choking him. Hewitt then shoved him, causing
his head to slam against the wall, punched him two or three times
in the chest and hit him once on his left side above the belt line,
Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, another officer entered the room. Jimenez said he
told the other officer he could not breathe normally. The cop told
him to relax and left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez threw up for the first time. The vomit was splashed with
blood. The second cop then returned, removed the handcuffs and gave
him water. The officer offered to provide medical attention, but
Jimenez said no.
</P>
<P>
   Reports indicate that Jimenez was released around 7:10 p.m. and
he walked back to the spot where he was arrested less than two
hours earlier. After finding his friend, Jimenez arrived at the
hospital about 30 minutes later, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Having recorded the tale of abuse, the sergeant who met Jimenez
at the hospital inspected interview room No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The carpet was stained red with bloody vomit. Dried blood was
splattered on one wall, according to documents.
</P>
<P>
   Official reports show the sergeant secured the room and summoned
the LAPD Crime Lab and Photo Lab. The room was photographed, and an
LAPD criminalist collected blood samples and cut out a
12-inch-square piece of carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Later, photographs were snapped of Jimenez's injuries, and his
blood was drawn. Jimenez's DNA was matched to samples from the
room.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, the LAPD Board of Rights reviewed the evidence,
called several witnesses, heard Hewitt's defense and concluded
Jimenez was illegally arrested and beaten, according to the hearing
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the board found Hewitt guilty of six counts related to
the arrests of Jimenez and his friend. Perhaps most notably, the
board found that several of Hewitt's actions included ``elements of
criminality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can mitigate or otherwise condone the deprivation of
legal rights, particularly the assault of a handcuffed prisoner who
was improperly detained,'' the board concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Hewitt, you have become too much a liability to
yourself, partners, the city, the department and the community.
Therefore, this board recommends to the Chief of Police that you be
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office offered a different take on the
matter a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the LAPD completed by county prosecutors in
March, the District Attorney's Office concluded there was
``insufficient evidence'' to prove in court that Hewitt assaulted
Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accordingly, we decline prosecution,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   County prosecutors wrote there were no witnesses to the assault
other than perhaps Jimenez's friend in the other room.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bloody walls and vomit in the interview room, the
prosecutors conceded the evidence could ``potentially corroborate''
the allegations. They also noted that the emergency room doctor was
willing to testify that the injuries were consistent with being
choked and punched.

SHAQ THINKING BIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Shaquille O'Neal doesn't have the Most Valuable Player
award he so covets. But he's getting closer. He's got half of one.
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Angeles Lakers' mammoth center had barely said
thanks, after earning co-MVP of Sunday's NBA All-Star Game, before
he was already eying a bigger and better trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award is very nice, but I'm trying to get the big-picture
award,'' said O'Neal, who shared MVP honors with San Antonio's Tim
Duncan after they led the West to a 137-126 victory at The Arena in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is one up on me, because he has the big-picture award (an
NBA championship),'' O'Neal said. ``This is nice, it's fine. I'll
be a part of history. But the big-picture award is the award I'm
really looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that O'Neal doesn't value these lesser plaques.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he quietly fumed when media voters named the Bulls'
Michael Jordan the All-Star MVP, though O'Neal outscored him (25
points to 20).
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't forgotten the snub.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would not have won today, I still would have moved on,''
he said. ``I moved on in San Antonio when y'all gave it to Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had the bigger numbers (24 points, 10 rebounds), but
O'Neal got his quicker _ tallying 22 points, nine rebounds and
three blocks in 25 minutes. In deference to a sore right shoulder,
and a six-game road trip that starts Tuesday, West coach Phil
Jackson rested his center the entire fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal, a leading candidate for season MVP, sewed up
Sunday's honor early, as the West led for nearly the entire game
behind his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his time,'' said Lakers teammate and fellow All-Star
Kobe Bryant. ``He's been having a excellent season up to this
point, and whenever we were penetrating, I know personally I was
looking for big fella whenever I got it, try to get him to get this
thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan played 33 minutes and shared the team high in scoring
with Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves. Philadelphia
76ers guard Allen Iverson scored a game-high 26 points and had nine
assists for the East.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of Iverson, Bryant, Garnett and Toronto's
Vince Carter, the game was a bit short on sizzle, rarely arousing
the 18,235 fans in attendance. They saved most of their adulation
for two of the all-time greats _ Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   A Jordan highlights video played during a fourth-quarter
timeout, when Jordan was handed the All-Star host city torch on
behalf of his new employer, the Washington Wizards. Washington has
the game in 2001. The man who handed Jordan the honor was Golden
State Warriors owner Chris Cohan, who as the Bay Area's version of
Donald Sterling, was understandably booed.
</P>
<P>
   A video tribute to Chamberlain, who died in October, played
during a second-quarter timeout, evoking warm applause.
</P>
<P>
   For the live-action highlights, there was Carter, the new
slam-dunk champ, whose first four points came on a reverse jam off
an Iverson lob and a 270-degree spinning slam off the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal also played crowd-pleaser with a series of powerful
dunks, the best a breakaway, 360-degree spinning jam that evolved
so slowly, it looked like a stop-action film. ``Kind of caught me
off guard, I didn't know he had that in him,'' said Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal showed off his ballhandling by leading a coast-to-coast
fast break and laying it up himself.
</P>
<P>
   So make that the Most Versatile Player award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fast break better,'' O'Neal said. ``My teammates
were calling me `The Big Luggage' because of my handles.''
</P>
<P>
   His ballhandling teammate didn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Shaq bringing the ball up, I'm comfortable with it.
I don't know if P.J. (Jackson) is,'' Bryant said with a smile.
``Every time Shaq brings the ball up, I'm out in the lane. . . . He
throws the alley-oops, he can penetrate, so it's cool with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant played 28 minutes and though he had a relatively quiet
game _ 15 points on 7-of-16 shooting _ he displayed a few dunks and
one surprise move: a jump hook early in the third quarter, which he
swished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to throw the sky-hook for Magic (Johnson, who was in
attendance),'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jackson, coaching his third All-Star Game, played
diplomat on all fronts. He played everyone significant minutes,
save for Utah's Karl Malone (3 minutes) and San Antonio's David
Robinson (7 minutes) _ both aging stars asked out because of
nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson removed his ``Bill Bradley for President'' pin
before the NBC cameras rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't told to take it off,'' he said, ``but there was
friendly persuasion. The (Al) Gore people ran in from somewhere, I
don't know where.T.T.T. In fairness to the game, I decided to take
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   This All-Star Game might just as well be remembered for who
!ital!wasn't rebounding, dishing and jamming. No Jordan, for the
first time since 1995. No Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon,
Patrick Ewing and Mitch Richmond, Scottie Pippen and Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   In their place was Generation Y2K _ a group of nine first-time
All-Stars. Ushered in was the NBA's era of Iverson, Carter and
Michael Finley. Rasheed Wallace, Glenn Robinson, Jerry Stackhouse
and Allan Houston. Only one new All-Star came from the old school _
Indiana stalwart Dale Davis, in his ninth season.
</P>
<P>
   And even some of the All-Star vets were kids _ Bryant, making
his second appearance, is the youngest at age 21. Duncan and
Garnett are just 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's changing,'' said Seattle's Gary Payton, an
old-timer at 31 years and six All-Star Games. ``The NBA's changing.
The younger guys are playing hoop now and they're doing their
thing. So it's good to see some new things, but in a minute, you
won't see me here.''

LOS ANGELES: choked and punched. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, the District Attorney's Office had found its own
physician, Dr. Jordan Goodstein, a surgeon at Cedars-Sinai.
Goodstein reviewed Jimenez's medical records, photographs of
Jimenez, a summary of police reports related to the alleged beating
and scientific data from the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Goodstein concluded that ``the material provided to him did not
suggest that Jimenez had any serious injury,'' according to
documents, nor did it indicate the bloody vomit was related to
``blunt force trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodstein argued that it was more likely that Jimenez had a
small injury to his tongue or in his mouth, which was not detected
by the E.R. doctor. That possible, but undetected, cut might have
caused the blood stain on the carpet, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goodstein, the presence of mouth cells and saliva
in the blood stain suggested ``the likelihood that this has been
expectorated from the mouth rather than vomited.''
</P>
<P>
   That same issue came up at the LAPD disciplinary hearing. After
testimony from both the emergency room doctor and Goodstein, the
board found the conflicting opinions to be inconclusive and
stressed that any difference of opinion did not nullify other
evidence that Hewitt used unnecessary force.
</P>
<P>
   The board said any speculative cut to the mouth ``could have
occurred after Jimenez struck his head on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the bedsheet on which the E.R. doctor scribbled
Hewitt's name also was entered into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the disciplinary board relied on the testimony of
the security guard at the hospital and the cop who released Jimenez
from custody, both of whom stated that Jimenez did not look well
and needed medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness testified that he observed a person fitting
Jimenez's description vomiting outside the police station.
</P>
<P>
   And contradictory to the county prosecutors' stance, an LAPD
criminalist testified that the blood on the interview room carpet
was ``consistent with voluminous droppings, not spitting,''
documents reveal.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office also raised questions about
Jimenez's credibility as a witness. ``He is a felon on parole for
kidnapping,'' the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors argued Jimenez lied to investigators about
details of his arrest and claimed he did not know the name of the
officer who released him or the real name of the man he was with
when arrested. He later conceded that he knew his friend Hernandez
and the cop who let him go.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also surmised Hewitt could argue in court that
the cop who released Jimenez was the real attacker. They said
Jimenez was an informant for that officer and probably did not like
Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, those arguments were rejected by the LAPD Board of
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to tell Officer Hewitt and others who may hear about
this case that we know that the issues of credibility of a gang
member and a hard-core criminal vs. the credibility of a Los
Angeles police officer is of concern to you and may be to many
department employees. And it was an issue to us,'' an LAPD captain
on the board explained.
</P>
<P>
   While the board factored in Jimenez's and Hewitt's credibility,
the captain said, ``We based our decision ... on corroborative
evidence and testimony involving independent witnesses. ... (The)
charges are not hinged on credibility issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply, the board ruled there was enough evidence and
corroborative testimony to conclude that Hewitt beat Jimenez and
deserved to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Rampart corruption probe said Hewitt
should be behind bars awaiting a jury trial, not sitting at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put this guy before a jury,'' the source said.
``When is the last time you heard of the Police Department pushing
for the criminal prosecution of one of its own and the DA's Office
refusing to do anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing and insulting to the investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   If county prosecutors ultimately opt to put Hewitt on trial,
their own rationale could come back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   To make the jury question the charges against him, sources said,
Hewitt could easily submit the prosecutors' March report that
concludes, ``There is insufficient evidence to prove the truth of
the charges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got all of this evidence,'' the source said. ``I'm telling
you, boxes of it _ and they do this.''

RAMOS TO AFFECT REVOLUTION FORTUNES DIRECTLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Mauricio Ramos might not have won the
duel with Carlos Valderrama Sunday night. But the Revolution's
midfield leader took some strong steps toward establishing a
possession style of play in a 1-0 loss to the Tampa Bay Mutiny in
the MLS preseason tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama, whose arrival in Tampa last season paved the way for
Ramos to depart, sent a soft, bouncing pass into the penalty area
for Raul Diaz Arce to head into an empty net in the 83d minute.
Defender Gaston Pernia and goalkeeper Ignacio DeLeon collided and
were sprawled near the penalty spot for nearly a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike in the Revolution's opener, a reserve-fueled 2-1 win
over Chicago, the midfield of Leonel Alvarez, John Harkes, Johnny
Torres, and Ramos seemed cohesive. Ramos did not touch the ball for
the first five minutes but his teammates soon began finding him.
And Ramos displayed some accurate left-footed 40-yard bombs toward
the flanks as well as quick touch passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the main team in the first half; it was
better than in the first game,'' coach Fernando Clavijo said.
``They moved the ball well, forced errors, and played hard and won
50-50 balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo benched Eduardo ``El Tanque'' Hurtado for part of the
game and went with forwards Wolde Harris and Flavio Zuniga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eduardo needs to be motivated,'' Clavijo said. ``He is 10 to
15 pounds overweight. It's not a big issue now because there is
plenty of time before the start of the season, but I want to make
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along he can be a force in this league if he
wants to be. He has suffered because of the loss of Giovanni
(Savarese). But I haven't given up on him. He was unbelievably trim
when he was playing in Ecuador, but then he took a month off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado blew past a defender in the penalty area and lofted a
perfect cross to Imad Baba, who fired wide on the Revolution's best
chance in the 77th minute. The play concluded an impressive
counterattack started by Marcelo Russomando, and continued as
referee Ali Saheli played the advantage, later cautioning defender
Kalin Bankou.
</P>
<P>
   But Russomando's giveaway led to the goal six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution added two goalkeepers _ Scott Budnick, formerly
of Tampa Bay and Miami, and DeLeon, 21, of Deportivo Maldonado in
Uruguay. DeLeon, who has Italian citizenship, will likely find a
club in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Russomando, 29, played for Bella Vista, one of Uruguay's most
storied clubs. He and DeLeon are available on free transfers
through the Uruguayan super agent Paco Casal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russomando is used to the libero position and he can solve a
lot of problems,'' said Gonzalo Madrid, a Casal representative and
former rival of Clavijo. ``He has played on the national team, but
Uruguay has a lot of guys like Paolo Montero (Juventus) at that
position.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution dropped two central defenders _ Nicola
Innocentin, 22, and Adolfo Ovalle, 29. Innocentin, a free transfer
who is hoping to qualify for the MLS's junior international
program, will train with Miami, and Ovalle, a veteran of Emelec in
Ecuador, Santiago Morning, and Universidad de Chile, has been
claimed by Dallas . . . The Revolution will play the US Under-20
team in an exhibition Tuesday and another MLS foe either Wednesday
or Thursday.

JARRETT FAST OUT OF CHUTE 
</HEADLINE>
 SHOOTOUT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ After he won the pole for the 42d Daytona
500 Saturday, the only driving Dale Jarrett had planned on doing
Sunday was on the golf course. Until, that is, Jarrett's crew
chief, Todd Parrott, threw a wedge into the works and told him to
report for duty at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was planning on playing golf this morning and I wasn't even
going to run that Bud Shootout qualifier, but Todd said we had to
run it,'' Jarrett said. ``So I showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett did more than that. The defending NASCAR Winston Cup
champion flexed the muscle of his No. 88 Ford Quality Care Taurus
by outdriving the field in Sundya's 25-lap qualifier to earn a
berth in the Bud Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 25-lap featured event, Jarrett made it a clean
sweep when he became the first driver to win both the qualifier and
the Bud Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who won the 500 pole with a hot lap of 191.091 miles
per hour, started from the rear of the Shootout's 15-car field. He
never led a lap until he got a late-race push from the No. 18
Pontiac of Bobby Labonte, and motored to an exciting last-lap pass
of the Chevrolet Monte Carlos of runner-up Jeff Gordon and
third-place finisher Sterling Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting from 15th, I knew that, as close as the competition
was, our only chance was to do something with the pit stop and for
our crew to make a great stop _ and they did all of those things,''
Jarrett said. ``It's kind of hard to believe, but they got me in
the position and from there it's just being lucky and making the
right moves.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was marred by a last-lap crash in Turn 4 involving
Labonte, Marlin, and Ricky Rudd, Jarrett's teammate whose No. 28
Ford Havoline Taurus spun out after contact with Labonte's car,
slammed into the wall, became airborne before landing on its roof,
and slid to a stop near the start-finish line. Rudd was not hurt,
but his car, a backup, was severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby was on the outside and my car just took off pushing,''
Marlin said, taking full responsibility for the accident. ``I was
trying to turn it and it was like the wind got up under the front
end. I thought for a split second I was going to miss him, but it
was my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's car got sideways and slammed into the wall, causing
Rudd to lose control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one really looked bad, but it wasn't really nasty,'' said
Rudd, who survived a particularly nasty wreck 16 years ago in this
event. ``I just hate to see the car get torn up. The car actually
ran better than we thought it was going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Jarrett's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good opportunity for us to see what he had with the
car and run it,'' Jarrett said, ``because we hadn't been in these
type situations, so it gave us a little heads up on that.''
</P>
<P>
   After he won a broken-field runaway in the qualifier, Jarrett
used some perfect pit strategy and a little help from Labonte to
move up in the pack halfway through the 25-lap Shootout. On the
last lap, Marlin went low out of Turn 2 to prevent Gordon from
passing him on the inside, but inadvertently cracked open a window
of opportunity for Jarrett to make a pass outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Jeff and Sterling get side-by-side, I knew they
were giving me a chance then,'' Jarrett said. ``I was hoping
Sterling would stay down there beside him as much as he could
because that was going to give me more of an opportunity. The 18
(Labonte) stayed right with me and it gave me that push I needed
and I really sailed off into Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exciting race for us, but the pit stop and the pit
strategy is what got me in a position to win the race.''

BRUINS HOPING THEY CAN SHARPEN THEIR SKATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins were given a day off Sunday to regroup
following back-to-back losses in New York to the Rangers and at
home against the Florida Panthers. On the way to the dressing room
after their 5-1 drubbing at the FleetCenter, the Bruins heard a
cascade of loud, heartfelt, deeply frustrated boos from the fans
who stuck around.
</P>
<P>
   From a standings perspective, the Bruins are far from out of it.
However, the way the team is playing right now, it looks completely
out of it. This year has been full of missed opportunities. On
Friday, the Bruins had the chance to tie the Rangers for eighth
place in the Eastern Conference. Instead, their lost weekend has
resulted in the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins moving ahead
of them.
</P>
<P>
   There was turmoil at the beginning of the year when the club
stumbled out of the gate at 0-5-4. There was turmoil after
Thanksgiving when the Bruins went 3-12-8 during a 23-game span.
There was turmoil when owner Jeremy Jacobs publicly criticized
coach Pat Burns. There was turmoil when right wing Joe Murphy
verbally attacked his coach on several occasions before being fired
for insubordination. And the turmoil continues Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The only tranquil part of the season was a one-month period from
Oct. 23 to Nov. 24 when Boston put together an 11-2-1 run. However,
the team couldn't sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 games remaining, the Bruins can't seem to get out of
their own way. As captain Ray Bourque said Saturday night after the
Florida game, ``Win one, lose one ain't going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what is wrong with this team, goalie Byron Dafoe
laughed ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the million-dollar question right now,'' he said.
``It's really hard to pinpoint. I can't say it's a lack of effort.
We've been playing hard but mistakes are killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were in the Rangers and Panthers games heading into
the third periods _ but then collapsed. One goal led to others and
eventual disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we give up a goal and then we start reeling,'' said
Dafoe. ``With the playoffs looming, we have to find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the team's thin talent level is an issue. Gone is center
Jason Allison, who won't be back until training camp at the
earliest. Anson Carter is playing out of position and is hurt. Dave
Andreychuk has been severely affected by the loss of Allison. Joe
Thornton is banged up. The defense, which has been suspect all
season, used to be the club's strongest suit. When the perennially
challenged offense fell off, the defense was always there to carry
the day. And the rare time when the defense failed, the goaltending
was there. Too often this season, the team defense is the weak link
and Dafoe has had a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that when the Bruins gave up three goals in a
game, that was a big deal. Now, it's a routine event. Consider that
last season, in 82 games, the Bruins gave up three or more goals 31
times. Through 58 games this year, the Bruins already have given up
three or more on 30 occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the team goals-against, it's up so much higher
than it was last year,'' said Dafoe, whose club was outscored,
10-3, over the weekend. ``It's tough. I look at my own play and I
ask myself how I can be better. All you can do is keep working.
We're trying to figure it out and it's definitely very frustrating.
Talk about your sleepless nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as the father of an infant son, Dafoe said he has two
reasons keeping him wide awake at night, one a much happier reason
than the other.
</P>
<P>
   So, now what? The team has been assured that Burns won't be
fired this year, a point president/general manager Harry Sinden
hammered home Saturday in an effort to shoot down persistent
speculation about the coach's termination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the club continues to muddle along, not out of the
race for a postseason berth but looking increasingly like a
nonstarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make excuses for us,'' said Dafoe. ``We're
coming up short.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's one ray of light, Dafoe said it's the fact that a
decent run could change everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope no one is losing sight of that,'' said the netminder,
looking for the silver lining in a season that has been shrouded by
a giant dark cloud. ``It's very much in reach. If we could put a
streak together . . . ''

SHAKY US CHAMPS SLIP OUT OF TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 FIGURE SKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ They were still occupying their thrones when the US
Figure Skating Championships ended here Saturday night, but their
crowns had been knocked askew.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kwan had won her fourth women's title in five years,
but she won it because she made one mistake and high school rivals
Sasha Cohen and Sarah Hughes each made two. Michael Weiss retained
the men's title he'd inherited from Todd Eldredge, but needed four
artistic tiebreakers to beat 19-year-old Tim Goebel, who made
history by landing three quadruple jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the old saying in boxing that the champion has to be
knocked out,'' said Carol Heiss Jenkins, Goebel's coach. ``That
usually means a fall or two. It has to be pretty clear-cut. It's
like boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who thinks skating is a sport, not an art, Goebel
knocked the 23-year-old Weiss through the ropes. No man had even
landed one quad at a national championships. Goebel not only nailed
three in a row (one of them a combination), he landed half a dozen
triple jumps.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who has hit only one quad in competition, couldn't come
close on the only one he tried. He prevailed because Goebel stepped
out of a triple axel in a combination, which prevented him from
getting a string of perfect 6.0 technical marks, and because
Weiss's artistry is more evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the other side of the stick,'' said Weiss, who
was once labeled an unrefined aerialist. ``I've been in the
position where I was trying quads and Todd Eldredge was beating me.
But the judges have shown they want to see a balanced program.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges also were reluctant to weaken a defending world
medalist by sending him to next month's global championships in
France second in his own country. That sentiment also helped
19-year-old Kwan, who has won two world titles and was runner-up
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought Sasha was going to beat her at all,'' said
John A.W. Nicks, Cohen's coach. ``Michelle is the model of
consistency and she has carried the flag of the United States very
well for years. One flaw in an otherwise excellent program was not
going to hurt her.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the champs can't bring their stagnant technical side up
to the ever-rising mark, they'll almost certainly be unseated at
next year's championships in Boston _ and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my hands full,'' admitted Kwan, who is still stuck on
the same triple toe-triple toe combination she was doing five years
ago and who couldn't even land it here. ``I've just got to put my
mind to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old Hughes tried two triple-triples in the long
program and landed one of them. By next year, she'll probably be
able to hit the triple axel (which no woman has done since Tonya
Harding nine years ago) and possibly a quad. The 15-year-old Cohen
doesn't have the triple-triples yet, but she will.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, meanwhile, needs to find time amid her UCLA studies to be
the bold leaper she was at 15. ``At first it was, `She's a jumping
bean,' '' Kwan said. ``Then it was, `She's artistic, she's
beautiful on the ice.' I want to be the jumping bean again _
because I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Weiss can land a quad or three, he'd better start soon,
because the men's bar is ascending rapidly. He won this title with
nothing tougher than a triple axel-triple toe. He won't win another
without an upgrade. And he won't beat the Russians next month.
``I'm definitely going to have to step it up when we go to
Worlds,'' Weiss conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Evocative choreography to ``Carmen'' won't save him in 2001.
Once Goebel, the sport's new midair dervish, can build a polished
program around his quads and boost his artistic marks by a couple
of tenths, he'll be the new king. ``The judges aren't telling me
anything I don't already know,'' said Goebel. ``I just need time.''

NELSON'S RECORD IS SAFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It's over.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson put an end to the longest PGA Tour winning streak
in 52 years Sunday, but Tiger Woods didn't go down easily.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Woods, who had won six straight tournaments to
tie Ben Hogan for the second-longest streak in tour history, made
up seven strokes to catch third-round leader Mickelson on the 13th
hole. Then Mickelson counter-rallied down the stretch to finish
18-under-par 270 for a four-stroke win in the Buick Invitational at
Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go against the best player in the world and come out on top
means a lot to me,'' said Mickelson, who came away from the victory
with two thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   ``One, the confidence that I can play against the best and I can
win. and two, the next time I get a six-seven-shot lead, I need to
get tougher and make it eight, nine or 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who closed with a 68, tied Shigeki Maruyama for second
place at 274. Davis Love III was next at 275 ahead of the
fifth-place trio of Kevin Sutherland, Kirk Triplett and Fred
Couples, all at 276.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the drama involved hometown hero Mickelson and the
surging Woods, who had won from seven strokes off the pace in the
final seven holes last week and was making a similar charge when he
made up seven shots in an eight-hole stretch Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lefty vs. Stripes, with a crowd of 45,000 roaring them
on, some with faces painted orange and black. For a while, it was
so exciting, it seemed like some of the best of the memorable
matchups between Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, or Nicklaus and
Lee Trevino or Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Woods' brilliant short-game play couldn't salvage
his erratic ball-striking, but he arrived at the end of his streak
far from despondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To even be under par was kind of a miracle,'' said Woods, who
birdied the first hole after hitting a chair with his drive, then
missed eight of the first 13 greens and found himself 5-under for
the day and tied for the tournament lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he was disappointed not to win but ``Just to kind of
hang in there and hang in there, chip and putt and just grind away
at it, and just give myself a chance was _ I was very proud of
myself for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Mickelson proud to be the one to end the streak that got
within five wins of Byron Nelson's record 11?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``I'd be proud if I could be the guy
that had the six-tournament streak.''
</P>
<P>
   A seven-stroke lead with 12 holes to play sure didn't last long
for Mickelson, as Woods' early charge and a pair of double-bogeys
by Mickelson left them tied for the lead at 15-under par when Woods
birdied the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, playing behind Woods, then followed with probably his
most important shot of the tournament. After driving into the left
rough and having to chip back to the fairway, a 9-iron from
116 yards to within three feet to regain the lead with his own
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly rejuvenated after that save, Michelson played 1-under
over the final five holes while Woods struggled to hit fairways and
greens down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama also challenged at the 13th hole, reaching the par-5 in
two shots. He missed an eagle putt that could have tied him for the
lead but birdied to get within a stroke. Then Mickelson's
scrambling birdie dropped Maruyama two strokes back, and he never
got closer.
</P>
<P>
   That birdie was the play of the day for Mickelson, but he gave
nearly as much credit to his second double-bogey, on No.11, for
forcing him to play more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mindset changed,'' he said. ``I had to play the way I was
playing the first three rounds and I tried to attack the 12th
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson parred the par-4 12th, but the aggression helped him
take control of the tournament over his final six holes.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no panic when Woods made up seven strokes in
eight holes to tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was going through my head on 13 was I needed to make
birdie,'' Mickelson said. ``If I made birdie, I regained the one-
shot lead. That's exactly what was going through my head.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Woods felt about competing while struggling, so did
Mickelson feel good about responding to pressure when it seemed
Woods had the momentum. After scrambling out of the rough to save
birdie on 13, Mickelson followed with a brilliant approach shot for
another birdie on 14, right after Woods had bogeyed that hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to pull the two best shots that I hit all week,''
Mickelson said. ``I just wanted the opportunity, and I want more
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one way I'm going to get better and that's to go
head-to-head against Tiger Woods.''

OHNO OUT; WEINSTEIN WINS 
</HEADLINE>
 SPEEDSKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALPOLE, Mass. _ After Apolo Anton Ohno was injured in the
quarterfinals, Daniel Weinstein won the 1,000-meter race Sunday,
securing a US spot at the World Cup individual championships. He
also qualified for the World Cup team competition.
</P>
<P>
   When Ohno caught his skate on a marking block in the
quarterfinal heat of the 1,000-meter race, Weinstein had mixed
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, his thought was that the semifinal heat would be
easier, ``but when I saw Apolo hit the boards,'' said Weinstein,
19. ``I realized that the relay team needs him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught the block and my knee popped,'' said Ohno. ``I
freaked when it happened because I couldn't pop my knee back. But
when I sat down, I was able to pop it back.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1,000-meter race in the US Short-Track Championships at
Iorio Arena was key to determining the US men's champion, and with
Ohno off to Children's Hospital in Boston for X-rays, the race was
left to Weinstein, a freshman at Harvard University, and Rusty
Smith, 20, of Sunset Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a marvelous race, as Brookline's Weinstein took the
lead with four laps to go ``and I made an outside move on Rusty,''
he said. ``Then, with two laps to go, he passed me again, and I
passed him right back.''
</P>
<P>
   And the two came to the finish line, skate to skate, with
Weinstein edging Smith, 1:30.761 to 1:30.841. Tom O'Hare, 22, of
St. Louis, was third (1:30.877) and Ian Baranski, 20, of Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., was fourth (1:33.194).
</P>
<P>
   Ohno's X-rays came back negative and he was released from the
hospital. It is unclear whether Ohno will be ready to compete in
the Goodwill Games next weekend in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apolo has been looking forward to competing in the Goodwill
Games and it's something he really wanted to do,'' said Susan
Ellis, the US National Short-Track team coach. ``But it's too early
to know if he'll be able to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fall and the fact Ohno did not receive any points
for the 1,000-meter race, he will be one of three US skaters
competing in the World Cup individual championships next month in
Sheffield, England. Weinstein, as champion, and Smith, as
runner-up, also will compete. Those three, plus O'Hare and
Baranski, will make up the five-member US team at the World Cup
team championships next month at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, Amy Peterson, 28, of Ballston Springs,
N.Y., won the US championship, continuing her dominance as she
easily took both the 1,000-meter and 3,000-meter races, just as she
won the 500 meters and 1,500 meters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson and Julie Goskowicz, 19, of Maple Grove, Minn., who
finished second to Peterson in all four races, will represent the
United States in the World Cup individual races at Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Those two, plus Natick's Caroline Hallisey, 19, who finished
third in the championships despite being disqualified for an
illegal pass during the semifinals of the 1,000 meters, Brigid
Farrell, 17, of Saratoga Springs, and Arlington's Sarah Lang, 22,
will comprise the five-member US team in the World Cup team
competition at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm six years older than any of the other girls,'' said
Peterson, downplaying the ease of her dominance, ``and I have much
more experience than the other girls. That experience definitely
pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson, who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome, belied
her ailment and crushed her competition. Hallisey, who was also
under the weather, was ecstatic at her third-place finish despite
being disqualified and receiving no points in the 1,000 meters. In
fact, Hallisey now seems committed to short-track skating after
saying she was possibly leaning toward long-track skating before
the US Championships began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best of all passes,'' said Hallisey, explaining
her DQ. ``But I'm really happy to make the team (for the worlds).
To see how strong I was skating, considering how I felt, I might
stick it out now (in short-track).''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was excited about winning the US title ``before all my
family and my friends from school.'' His US title in the bag,
Weinstein decided to have some fun while breaking from the pack
early in the 3,000 and opening up a huge lead before Smith skated
him down in the final half-lap and eked out a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, the 3,000 goes slow early with skaters just
standing, but with 25 laps to go, I decided to (break out),'' he
said. ``For some reason, I got the urge.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the US team's chances in international competition, and
Salt Lake City in two years, Weinstein said, ``I'd say we're in the
top four or five (countries) now. But we're definitely moving up.
Apolo's only 17, I'm 19, and Tommy (O'Hare) is the old man at 22.
We're such a young team.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Both Ohno and Weinstein, in fact, are still listed as
juniors.

WATCH OUT FOR FLAMES
</HEADLINE>

By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray spent Saturday
night channel surfing among eight NHL games on his satellite dish,
but he kept coming back to one team that looked very familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The Calgary Flames are in the midst of a woeful 0-7-1 stretch,
including six consecutive losses heading into tonight's game at the
Staples Center. As Murray watched the Flames lose 4-3 to the
Phoenix Coyotes, he was reminded of his own team's six-game slide
in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through it, hoping the team continues to play hard and
work its way out,'' Murray said. ``We played some really bad games
at the beginning, then got better but still couldn't win. I
considered us dangerous every time out and the Flames are the same
way right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (25-22-7) have won four of their last five, including
victories over Western Conference elite teams Detroit, Phoenix and
Dallas. In fact, before Saturday's game against Calgary, Coyotes
coach Bob Francis kept his team off the ice and made them watch
tapes of the Kings 5-2 victory over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary (23-27-6) was the league's surprise club during the
season's first four months, setting an NHL record with 10 overtime
victories. Fred Brathwaite replaced injured veteran Grant Fuhr in
goal and was considered by many an MVP candidate. Now, Brathwaite
has been pulled from a couple of games and replaced by
Jean-Sebastien Giguere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone eight games without a win now and everyone looked
like this, either a one-goal loss or overtime,'' Flames coach Brian
Sutter said after the Phoenix game. ``You know you're right in it
until the end. What you do is dig down a little more in those
situations yourself. It's called growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Audette closer: Second-line winger Donald Audette skated in
practice Sunday for the first time since going on injured reserve a
month ago with a severely sprained left ankle. Audette will not
play tonight but should return early in the Kings seven-game,
11-day trip that begins Wednesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference now is pain,'' Audette said. ``I don't have any
now and it makes it much easier to get around on the ice. I'm
excited about getting back. I've been going crazy with boredom.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, however, likes the effort of Audette's replacement,
Jason Blake, and said it would be unfair to make a switch
immediately. Audette skated with the third line in Sunday's
practice.

LOSS JUST A BLIP ON WAY TO WOODS' ULTIMATE GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Not all twenty-somethings are like the woman we
recently saw quoted as saying, ``The real drive is to make a lot of
money and retire by the time you're 32.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, the patron saint of Generation Y2K's cabal of
capitalists, could retire right now, at age 24, and live, as you'd
expect the Sultan of Swing would, in obscene opulence.
</P>
<P>
   Since turning professional in the fall of 1996, Woods has
grossed $13,316,379 on the course and several times that much off
it. From a promotional standpoint he is the most prime piece of
property this side of the Sunset Strip, endorsing everything from
clothes and cars to burgers and breakfast cereal to Titleists and
timepieces.
</P>
<P>
   Kids walked around the South Course at Torrey Pines on Sunday
with their faces painted orange with black stripes in deference to
Woods. Because of him, adults were decked out in swooshes. Thanks
to him, the golfers' garish outfits no longer account for all the
color on the course.
</P>
<P>
   And because of him, the Buick Invitational and CBS got a final-
day telecast worthy of the first day of sweeps week.
</P>
<P>
   It was by no means a disappointing ending just because Phil
Mickelson snapped Woods' consecutive win streak at six, hanging on
by his cuticles to beat Woods and Japan's Shigeki Maruyama by four.
</P>
<P>
   Woods did everything but blow on his putter in an effort to roll
a lucky seven. Down six strokes at the beginning of the day, he
pulled to within four of Mickelson with nine holes remaining and
drew even with him with five holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his aura evaporated the last five holes. It was four days
coming and as inevitable as Cal Ripken Jr. sitting out a game,
Edwin Moses failing to break the tape, Joe DiMaggio going hitless,
Wayne Gretzky going pointless, the Bucks toppling the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, I feel disappointment,'' said Woods, who
was battling his swing all week. ``I wasn't hitting it good today.
I tried almost everything. At least I made it interesting for
Phil.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it looked like Woods was going to make mincemeat of
Mickelson, the way he had Matt Gogel the previous week in Pebble
Beach. Mickelson carded his second double bogey in five holes at
No. 11 around the time Woods' second consecutive birdie putt was
dropping at No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Woods and Mickelson, a San Diego native, were
even at 15-under par. But for the first time since late August,
Woods blinked first. He played the final five holes in 1-over par
while Mickelson covered the same terrain in 2-under par.
</P>
<P>
   So the streak is dead. Big deal. Byron Nelson, who had 11
consecutive wins in 1948, is the only golfer who ought to be
breathing easier today.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing really ended Sunday. Woods simply completed another leg
of the exhausting Iconman race he seems fully intent on completing.
</P>
<P>
   He is on such a torrid pace, by the time he reaches the finish
line he will have lapped history. Woods is as much an anomaly as
the marathon runner who sprints out of the starting blocks. He
doesn't show any signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Since Woods stood up at a press conference in Milwaukee in the
fall of 1996 and said, ``Hello, World,'' the world has been
smitten, cradling Woods to its bosom.
</P>
<P>
   It's wonderful that Woods hasn't been frozen out, like his idol,
Jack Nicklaus, was in his first few years on the Tour when he was
bearing down on fan favorite Arnold Palmer. Woods deserves the
world's embrace. Not because he swings like Celine Dion sings and
has a smile you can spot a mile away. Not because he takes the job
of being a role model as seriously as he does his day job.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is worthy of applause because he's focused on a finish
line that's not delineated by any streak or monetary target.
</P>
<P>
   Woods doesn't want to win 11 consecutive tournaments because
Nelson did or 18 majors because Nicklaus did. He wants to win every
time he tees it up because he is addicted to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is his drug.
</P>
<P>
   Not fame. Not fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Simply sport.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play for the thrill of it,'' Woods said. ``You play for the
first three-and-a-half days to give yourself a chance on the back
nine on Sunday. You give it everything you have and there's no
regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has played in 73 events as a pro and finished first or
second in 22 of them. He has been a junkie, indiscriminately
feeding his craving for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt any relief to put the pressure of the streak
behind him, Woods replied, ``I wish I could say there was. I don't
know if you can be too excited about finishing second.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he's hopelessly addicted to the highs of his sport.
If he's not careful, it'll end up being history's undoing. &QL;

CLASH OF WILLS LED TO GALLOWAY'S DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Joey Galloway has the contract he wanted but
the Seahawks could not, and would not, give him. The Seahawks have
multiple picks in the first round of the NFL draft for the next two
years. The Dallas Cowboys have a receiver to replace Michael Irvin
and replenish owner Jerry Jones' ego.
</P>
<P>
   The blockbuster trade between the Seahawks and Cowboys
accomplished all of this Saturday, when Galloway collected a $12.5
million signing bonus as part of his seven-year, $42 million
contract with the Cowboys and the Seahawks acquired Dallas'
first-round draft choices this year and in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But left unanswered was this:
</P>
<P>
   How could Galloway, a player like no other the Seahawks had ever
had, become just another player they no longer have?
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of this relationship boiled down to a clash of
strong wills _ with coach and general manager Mike Holmgren in one
corner and Galloway in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Each tried to say the right things, during and after Galloway's
101-day holdout. But their body language spoke more clearly.
Galloway did not want to be a part of Holmgren's Seahawks,
especially at what he felt was the club's below-market price. And
as this eight-month ordeal was dragging into it its second
off-season, it was becoming increasingly clear to Holmgren that
Galloway could not stay.
</P>
<P>
   The final realization occurred during the postseason talks
Holmgren held with each of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting a little inkling in our exit interview, when
I really asked him to tell me how he was feeling about the whole
thing,'' Holmgren said after his news conference to announce
completion of the Galloway trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I want you here. You tell me how this is for you,'''
Holmgren said. ``This isn't prison. I don't want anyone feeling
that way. He was good about it, I don't think it was personal. But
that's when I first started thinking this was going to be the only
way to remedy the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   This revelation from that exit meeting, however, was rooted in
Galloway's refusal to enter the new world of the Seahawks _ the way
things are being done and will be done under Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren wants his players, as well as everyone else in the
league, to take him at his word. So when he told Galloway his new
deal would continue to be worked on after Galloway reported to
training camp, Holmgren expected to see the team's leading receiver
on the practice field at Eastern Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Galloway not only sat out all of training
camp and the entire preseason, but the first eight games of the
regular season. The lack of progress in the negotiations, and
things that were said and done during the prolonged impasse, only
served to further fray an already disentangled dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway wanted what he felt was a fair contract, and he felt
some vindication after finally getting it from the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, however, will not back down from his contention that
the Seahawks offered Galloway what he was worth, as well as his
conviction that the club will not overspend just because owner Paul
Allen has billionaire-deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiscally, we have to change. We have to make good decisions,
particularly on monies that are going to be accumulated down the
road,'' Holmgren said of the spending spree the past three
off-seasons that has left the club all but tapped out on its salary
cap. ``If we find a player we have to have _ (begin italic) have to
have (end italic) _ the numbers still have to make sense to me.
Certainly the resources here allow us to do that. But I also have
to be a good steward of Mr. Allen's money.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway is a proud person who felt disrespected by the
Seahawks' initial offer, and he became disgruntled by the hardline
stance the club took as his holdout went from days to weeks to
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Seattle deteriorated in so many ways,''
Galloway said. ``I'm glad that is behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the easiest way to explain all of this is the simple
fact that Holmgren never shared Galloway's appraisal of his
talents.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that Galloway's speed and uncanny ability to
explode into an extra gear while seemingly running at full throttle
are unmatched in the NFL. There was no comparison between the
numbers Galloway put up in his first four seasons (261 catches,
4,122 yards and 36 receiving touchdowns) and those of other players
who entered the league at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But to play in Holmgren's offense, a receiver also must be able
to block, turn a short catch over the middle into a long gain and
sell his routes when he is not the primary receiver.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that Galloway couldn't do these things. It was worse.
He seemed unwilling to do them.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, and countless others, Holmgren and Galloway
never reached a common ground. At least they finally realized they
never would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never did click,'' Holmgren said. ``People will say the
right thing after something like that. But it's one of those
unfortunate things where it never seems to be as good after it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides not only agreed to cut their losses, they were able
to turn them into significant gains.

WEST IS BEST IN NBA ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The enormous power and brute strength was
enough to make Western Conference coach Phil Jackson a little
giddy.
</P>
<P>
   As if his group of all-stars weren't towering enough, Jackson
wanted to drive home the point by starting five 7-footers.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that was the big joke in the locker room before the West
bullied the Eastern Conference in a 137-126 victory Sunday at the
Arena in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   When the West's front line of Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett
and Tim Duncan finished decimating a considerably smaller East
squad inside, the punch line to the NBA's 49th All-Star Game was
simple:
</P>
<P>
   Size matters, a lot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, Duncan and Garnett combined for 70 points and 33
rebounds, and that was all the West needed to snap a four-game
All-Star losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in here arguing before the game because Kevin wanted
to play the point,'' starting West point guard Jason Kidd said,
smiling. ``That's a monster front line. And all of those guys can
handle the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the Triple Towers are more of an authority when
it comes to finishing plays.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and O'Neal were the most dominant players on the floor
and shared the game's Most Valuable Player award. They were
primarily the reasons Kidd collected a game-high 14 assists in
front of his hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Oakland native and Sonics guard Gary Payton came off the
bench for the West and dished out eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   The West, which won the midseason classic for just the 18th
time, had a simple gameplan. If the fastbreak or spectacular play
wasn't available, just lob the ball to the middle. Something good
or earth-shattering was bound to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The West outscored the East, 86-54, in the paint and finished
with a 58-46 edge in rebounds. No one on the East had more than
eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a battle of size versus quickness,'' said Duncan, who
missed just two of 14 shots and grabbed 14 rebounds. ``There's so
much talent on both sides. And on this given day, the size won.
Hopefully, (the power) keeps swinging to the West side because we'd
love to keep on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The West roster had seven players 6-foot-9 or taller, with
Duncan (7-foot), O'Neal (7-1) and David Robinson (7-1) the biggest
giants. Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo (7-2) was the only man who
matched up for the East, which had just three players over 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing in the NBA is not one dominant player,''
Garnett said. `` ... And the big man has transcended the game,
handling the ball and having a 6-11 guy in the small forward
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who felt as though he was overlooked for MVP at the 1996
All-Star Game in San Antonio, played as if he were on a mission. He
converted 11 of 20 field goals and didn't play in the fourth
quarter. O'Neal also got a rise out of the crowd in the second
quarter when he dribbled the length of the court and scooped in a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of his other scores were dunks. O'Neal said he
wasn't trying to win the MVP as much as he was making a statement
about where he intends to be in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice and exciting. I'll be a part of history,'' said
O'Neal, who also had fun converting a 360-degree dunk on one
fastbreak. ``But the big-picture award (NBA championship) is the
award I'm really looking for. If we would not have won today, I
still would have moved on. I moved on in San Antonio when you (the
media) gave it to Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan attended Sunday but only as a spectator. And even he
would not have made a difference for the East this time.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, the league scoring leader, was
Jordanesque in his first all-star appearance, finishing with a
game-high 26 points. And when Iverson wasn't scoring, he tried to
set up Toronto leaper Vince Carter for highlight reel dunks and
finished with nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys did a great job of finishing when I gave them passes,
and they didn't take anything away from my game,'' Iverson said.
``A lot of guys were so unselfish, they wanted to bring the ball
down and have me run off screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the East made several runs, its only lead was 97-95
late in the third quarter. And that was brief. Duncan immediately
tied the game with a thunderous dunk, and Chris Webber put back a
Payton miss for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The West took control for good with a 20-9 run to start the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a historical front line, there,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the West's smaller players were nonfactors. Kidd had
the most assists in an All-Star game since Payton recorded 15 in
1995. The game also marked the first time Payton and Kidd played
together professionally in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Payton actually ignited Kidd's game when he came off the bench
in the first quarter and set up Kidd for two open jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get him in the flow,'' Payton said. ``He
didn't take a shot until I got in there. So I drew the double team
and got the ball to him. He started to look more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton didn't look to score, but he is the most accomplished
Oakland product in the NBA. That was confirmed when Payton received
the loudest ovation of any player during pregame introductions.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much chance Payton and Kidd would share MVP. They
were on the floor together for a total of six minutes in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Karl Malone and John Stockton get (co-MVP) in Salt Lake
City, and getting it here would have been awesome,'' Kidd said.
``But it didn't put a damper on the weekend. We won, we stopped our
losing streak and we had a lot of fun. That was the key.''

WHAT EXACTLY IS OSCAR'S STYLE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya's goals this year: Knock out each of four
opponents and settle into a style.
</P>
<P>
   The former welterweight champion _ who faces Derrell Coley on
Feb. 26 in New York _ recently turned 27 but had yet to decide what
type of fighter he wants to be. Depending on the fight, he's been a
defensive specialist, a boxer and a puncher.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many believe, he's been an underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   In his last fight, his controversial loss to Felilx Trinidad in
September, De La Hoya decided for some reason to box and run and he
paid the price: Believing he was well ahead in the scoring, he gave
away the final three rounds and lost.
</P>
<P>
   He was criticized for both his nonengaging tactics and the
stupid decision to stop fighting after nine rounds. Now, he says
such days are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this year, what I'm going to do is settle into one
style,'' he said. ``. . . I trained a certain way (to box, not
brawl) for certain fights. That's what other people wanted me to
train like. It wasn't my style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going back to my style. I'm going to try to go for the
knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened against Trinidad?
</P>
<P>
   Well, De La Hoya has finally gotten around to blaming himself.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he still believes he won, as do many others. He even said
that it was an ``easy fight.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he also said he wasn't prepared to take out Trinidad in
the late rounds even though it appeared the Puerto Rican was
vulnerable because he (De La Hoya) trained to box 12 rounds with
limited sparring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said the same thing, that I should've knocked him
out around the eighth round,'' De La Hoya said. ``I trained three
months to box the guy. I wasn't confident with my conditioning. If
I'd gone for the knockout, I was worried I'd get tired. I had no
choice but to go 12 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . Now, I'm making sure I (spar) 12, 13, 14 rounds in the
gym. That'll make a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said he has recovered from the psychological trauma
of his first loss. ``Things happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the setback seems to have left him with a sense of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Until Trinidad, he admitted, he was overconfident. He would
train just enough to win and spend the rest of his time playing
golf and staying up _ or should that be ``out?'' _ late at night.
</P>
<P>
   He insists his mind is back in boxing. As evidence, his training
camp for the Coley fight has been closed to the public and media,
an indication he's not fooling around even against a marginal
opponent like Coley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '99, I was on top of the world,'' he said. ``I'd train just
enough to get by a fight. Now, it's a whole different mentality. .
. . I'm focusing more on working harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sparring 12 rounds almost every other day. I feel
great. No distractions. It's all about getting hard work in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . If I get in the best shape of my life, no one can stop
me. That's the way I feel.'' __ Trinidad's side: Trinidad has been
resoundedly criticized after the De La Hoya fight, in which he
couldn't catch De La Hoya to hit him and took a lot of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Some even believe Trinidad was exposed as a limited fighter.
He's favored to beat relatively inexperienced David Reid on March
3, but a poll of boxing writers and broadcasters favors Reid
26-21-2.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``De La Hoya ran a great deal in that fight,'' he said through
an interpreter. ``It wasn't about boxing, it was really about
running. As a result, I couldn't fight my fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . The writers who participated in the poll certainly know
I'm a good champion, an excellent welterweight champion. I have 15
title defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . .I'd like to ask (members of the media) to observe me
closely. I work very hard. I want them to see this fight on March
3. I'll demonstrate the kind of champion I've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Trinidad-De La Hoya II: The way Trinidad and De La Hoya talk,
the rematch might not take place for some time. Trinidad said De La
Hoya had his chance for a rematch _ on Trinidad's terms _ and blew
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar is running from me,'' he said. ``We sat down to
negotiate the fight, at welterweight, and it appears that
(promoter) Bob Arum is taking Oscar down the wrong path, giving him
the wrong advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to fight me, so I'm moving along.''
</P>
<P>
   Said De La Hoya, who was as stubborn as Trinidad when it came to
negotiations:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, it's not important at all (that I fight
him again). I have my schedule set for 2000, four fights. If he
doesn't want to be included in my schedule, he won't be. If he's
stubborn, he won't fight me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do? Go on with my career.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's handlers are negotiating with Shane Mosley for a
fight in June, possibly at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   __ Weighty issue: Trinidad said he will decide after the Reid
fight _ at 154 pounds _ whether he'll go back down to 147 but added
that it isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   __ Typical De La Hoya: De La Hoya has dismissed advising trainer
Gil Clancy to preserve peace in his camp, which fits a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter has made a habit of making decisions to placate
those around him instead of using sound reasoning. Apparently,
Clancy was voted out of camp by De La Hoya's father, brother and
trainer Robert Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clancy was to blame for De La Hoya's late-fight strategy
against Trinidad, he's recognized as a knowledgable boxing man who
could be an asset in anyone's camp. Now, De La Hoya is left only
with Alcazar, who lacks universal respect.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stay tuned: The first of three consecutive big weekends
begins this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, popular Angel Manfredy takes on Sean Fletcher in a
10-round lightweight bout in New Jersey on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Erik Morales defends his WBC super bantamweight
title against fellow Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera in Las Vegas on
HBO. That matchup is intriguing. Morales and Barrera are both
fearless boxer-punchers who typically engage in thrilling bouts.
Morales is better and should win, but it should be interesting
while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Cole is the follwing weekend, Trinidad-Reid and
Paulie Ayala-Johnny Bredahl the weekend after that.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Cesar Chavez, hoping to get one more title shot, faces
journeyman Bobby Elkins on the Trinidad-Reid card.
</P>
<P>
   __ Great loss: Beau Jack, a two-time lightweight champ as
recognized by the New York Boxing Association in the '40s, died
last week from complications of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   He beat such notable fighters as Henry Armstrong, Bob
Montgomery, Sammy Angott, Johnny Bratton, Tony Janiro and Lew
Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   He fought 21 main events at Madison Square Garden, a record that
stands.
</P>
<P>
   __ Amateur boxing: Jose Aguiniga of Oxnard failed in his bid to
earn a spot in the U.S. Olympic Boxing Trials boxoffs on Feb. 24-26
in Mashantucket, Conn. He lost to Roberto Benitez of New York 19-11
in the 112-pound division on Sunday to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez will face Los Angeles' Jose Navarro in the boxoffs.
Navarro beat Benitez 26-21 in the championship final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mosley, the cousin of Shane Mosley, won the championship
of the 147-pound division and will compete in the boxoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Winners at the boxoffs go to Americas qualifying for boxers from
North America, South America, Central America and the Carribbean,
which will produce 54 Olypians.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: The UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History is
exhibiting photos from Muhammad Ali's trip to Zaire in 1974, when
he knocked out George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   The photos were taken by Ali's personal photographer, Howard L.
Bingham. Information: (310) 825-4361. . . .

   IBF junior bantamweight champion Mark Johnson has been sentenced
to one year in prison on a parole violation and is awaiting trial
on drug possession and assault charges after authorities said he
broke his wife's jaw. . . . Lawrence Clay-Bey will face Chris Byrd
in an interesting heavyweight matchup on April 1 in Las Vegas. . .

EDITORIAL: CHURNING ON CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Americans looking for progress this election year on the issue
of campaign finance reform got some conflicting signals last week.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming himself a ``reformer with results,'' Gov. George
Bush accused Sen. John McCain of hypocrisy for accepting donations
from political action committees and lobbyists. This was clearly an
effort to find some flaw in McCain's reputation as a reformer. It
was also, in a backhanded way, a tribute to McCain's efforts to
illuminate the issue, as well as further evidence that the issue
has begun to appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the week also brought a reminder that both
political parties are preparing to engage in the same careless
abuses this year that they engaged in four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page article in The New York Times reported that
President Clinton is soliciting millions of dollars in unregulated
soft-money donations to finance television ``issue ads'' for the
presidential nominee who emerges from the Democratic primary fight.
This is the same disreputable scheme his 1996 campaign pioneered to
circumvent the contribution and spending limits for publicly
financed presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This was entirely predictable, given Janet Reno's lazy
interpretations of election laws and her failure to order up an
unrestricted investigation of the 1996 Clinton-Gore fund raising.
Her permissiveness has encouraged aggressive panhandling for huge
donations from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals,
flouting federal campaign law.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats justify their hectic harvesting of soft money by
pointing to the Republicans' formidable soft-money machine. They
also say their nominee, whether Al Gore or Bill Bradley, is likely
to be impoverished by the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton, with just a year left to work on his legacy,
should be finding other ways to lead than by bad example. In
addition to his fund-raising appearances, he betrayed the reform
cause last week by nominating to the Federal Election Commission an
Ohio law professor, Bradley Smith. Smith opposes, on spurious First
Amendment grounds, reasonable limits on campaign money _ a
free-speech position the Supreme Court has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says it chose Smith, a favorite of campaign
reform's main nemesis, Sen. Mitch McConnell, in order to get its
judicial nominations through the Republican Congress. But a
president who meant what he said in his State of the Union address,
where he called for reform, would have stood by principle. New laws
are meaningless if the FEC will not enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fund-raiser who arranged Vice President Gore's
infamous Buddhist temple event, Maria Hsia, is now on trial in
Washington. Gore can do a lot to repair his image and demonstrate
the sincerity of his reform pledge by urging a Senate revolt
against Clinton's FEC choice. Bradley announced his opposition to
the Smith nomination over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the scurrying around for soft money, both Democratic
candidates have promised not to use it in the general election if
the Republican nominee will do the same. On the Republican side,
McCain has gone a step further, promising to forsake soft money
under any circumstances. These are merely promises, but they are
encouraging nonetheless. Moreover, they leave Bush as the only
major candidate not to have publicly committed to ending the
soft-money system.

MARE HAS MYSTIQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ If Manistique didn't stamp herself as the best
older mare in the West with Sunday's muddy victory in the $200,000
Santa Maria Handicap at Santa Anita, she certainly cast herself as
the best on this track.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year-old daughter of Unbridled won her fifth
consecutive race at Santa Anita in as many tries, giving owner
Marshall Naify's 505 Farms its second consecutive victory with this
sturdy horse.
</P>
<P>
   Manistique, who carried 125 pounds, gave away five to 15 pounds
to her seven rivals, but it meant little in the end as she won for
the 11th time to push her earnings over $11 million in 15 career
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that?'' Manistique's trainer, John Shirreffs, said.
``I'm extremely proud of her because she didn't have the best of it
today weight-wise, and she was squeezed coming out of the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Manistique's reputation started to come into question outside
California with a disappointing eighth place in November's
Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream Park, making her 0-3 outside
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Here, she has no rival, but her dominance was starting to slip.
In her previous four starts, she finished second at Del Mar last
August, won by a neck at Santa Anita in October and had an
impressive victory at Hollywood Park in December to show Shirreffs
she means business again.
</P>
<P>
   She strengthened her reputation again Sunday by beating a modest
field in the Grade I feature. She is now unbeaten in 11 starts at
Santa Anita and Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so rewarding because some of the Racing Form people
have been knocking her a little,'' Shirreffs said. ``So this is
really nice because this is one of the best fields she's ever run
against in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Frankel-trained Keeper Hill and Argentine-bred
Bordelaise figured to challenge Manistique. But under the urging of
jockey Corey Nakatani, she took the lead just past the eighth pole
and held off Snowberg and Gourmet Girl. Bordelaise and Keeper Hill
faded to the back of the pack, finishing seventh and eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeper Hill looked magnificent and so did (Bordelaise),''
Shirreffs said. ``I was a little worried when she (Manistique) was
four-wide, but Nakatani rode a good race because he didn't get
really hung out there badly. He kind of waited a little bit until
he got around the turn before he started going with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in her worst races, she digs it out when she's close to
the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani said he moved her outside because the track wasn't that
muddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to move her out of the dirt and get her comfortable
early,'' he said. ``She settled real nicely. The track is not that
bad out wide today. I was still sitting on her around the turn and
she just kept picking them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she did slip a few times in the lane and hesitated a
little when she got to the track marks, so I got after her a couple
of times late. She's just unbelievable.''

EDITORIAL: THE PUSH FOR PATIENTS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Senate and House approved vastly different
patients' rights bills. After months of delay, a conference
committee will meet later this month to reconcile the differences.
It is crucial that any compromise bill apply to all insured
Americans and give them a meaningful right to sue health plans for
damages incurred when care is improperly denied.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills differ greatly in the number of people covered and
their right to sue. The excellent House bill, sponsored by Charlie
Norwood and John Dingell, would cover all 161 million Americans who
have private insurance. It would also change federal law to permit
patients to sue their health plans in state courts under state
laws. This strong measure was approved by an impressive bipartisan
vote of 275-151 and has White House support.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the provisions of the weaker Senate bill, by contrast,
would apply only to the 48 million Americans in ``self-insured''
plans that are exempt from state regulation. The Senate bill
provides no right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Given this gulf, progress toward a viable compromise could take
months. But election-year politics may force some movement. After
all, 68 renegade House Republicans voted for the comprehensive
bill, a humiliating defeat for Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, who have been adamantly opposed to
comprehensive legislation, seem to know this is a potent issue for
the Democrats. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, recently
said a compromise might have to include a limited right to sue in
certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics is also putting a squeeze on Congress.
Both Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley, support the House bill. Even the top Republican
rivals, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain, support
some liability provisions. Bush backs federal legislation that
would mirror the patient protections laws in Texas. McCain says he
would support lawsuits after patients have gone through a full
review process, but with a cap on noneconomic damages.
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee is stacked with House members who voted
against the Norwood-Dingell bill. They may try to produce a final
bill that sounds consumer-friendly without providing true
protections. But the public wants more power over its health care,
and Republicans should grant it or they will suffer politically on
this issue.

INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT SUSPENDS ACCUSED GENERAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ President Abdurrahman Wahid on Sunday
backed away from his demand for the resignation of his defiant
security minister, General Wiranto, then turned around hours later
and suspended him.
</P>
<P>
   The general Monday morning bowed to the president's order,
saying, ``The fact that the president took a differ- ent decision
today, I don't know why, but it's his right and we must accept
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's apparent flip-flop came on the day he returned
from a two-week foreign trip during which he had repeatedly urged
the general to step down but constantly changed the details and
emphasis of his statements.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unusual long-distance confrontation had created
uncertainty in Jakarta and in foreign financial markets. It had
raised questions over whether he was cleverly pressuring the
general and smoking out enemies or whether he was not in full
control of his own impulsive statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't change my mind,'' the president insisted to reporters
this Monday morning. ``Yesterday I said that he will be examined by
the attorney general's office. Then after that he will resign. That
still applies.''
</P>
<P>
   But his Cabinet secretary, Marsi-H lam Simanjuntak, did call the
sus- pension a ``new decision,'' saying the president had decided
on the suspen- sion on Sunday night ``for the sake of the
government's stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The net result seemed to be that Wahid had succeeded in assert-
ing his dominance over the general but had reinforced doubts about
his own consistency and management style.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation with the country's most prominent military
figure also turned the president's policy of assertion of civilian
control into a dangerous crisis. It raised fears of a military
coup, fueled in part by Wahid's warnings, although the top armed
forces commander, Adm. Widodo Adi Sutjipto, said Monday that the
military supported the suspen- sion of Wiranto. And it left in
question both Wahid's personnel policies and the steadiness of his
stewardship as president.
</P>
<P>
   His demands for resignation had followed a report by a local
investigating commission that said the general _ Indonesia's most
prominent military man _ should face trial for his part in
atrocities committed in East Timor last year in which hundreds of
people died.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unusual behavior went so far as ordering Defense
Minister Juwono Sudarsono _ technically Wiranto's subordinate _ to
tell the general to resign. But the president chose not to issue a
direct order to the general.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to this verbal onslaught, Wiranto refused to resign
until he could speak directly with the president.
</P>
<P>
   That moment came hours after Wahid returned early Sunday to
Jakarta, in a meeting that also included Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri and the attorney general, who is charged with
investigating the general.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid then met with reporters and said, ``I asked him to resign
but he said he preferred to be investigated by a legal process and
I said, `OK' We have to give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have the prerogative to replace my ministers. But
we abide by the law. If the results of the report implicate him,
then he must resign.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to an expected report by the attorney general,
Marzuki Darusman, on whether Wiranto should be put on trial for the
violence and destruction that followed East Timor's vote last
August for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late at night, the president again met with Wiranto,
emerging at midnight to tell a small group of reporters that he had
suspended the general pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians remained confused Monday by their garrulous
president, and some analysts said he may have devalued the power of
his word by constantly changing it and by failing to demand
obedience.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some analysts said, it was notable that
during two weeks of sparring, Wiranto failed to garner strong
support from within the military, with several prominent commanders
asserting their allegiance to civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have appeared weak or vacillating in
terms of his personal command, he did emphasize the supremacy of
law in the first of his statements Sunday, placing the general's
fate in the hands of the attorney general, placing the issue in the
hands of the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to change my ministers,'' the president said.
``But we have to abide by the law. If the results of the report
implicate him, then he must resign, as I have already said
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what he has said is that he wanted the general to
resign immediately, even before any results or preliminary findings
are made. But he has declined to exercise his right to fire his
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who see cunning in Wahid's seemingly off-the-cuff style
say it seems to have the effect of pummeling his targets in his
chosen direction with a mixture of verbal rabbit punches, jokes and
expressions of personal regard. He is a difficult man to understand
or to grapple with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem,'' Wahid said at his first news conference
Sunday. ``Wiranto and I are good friends. It is the media that
perceives us to be enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president must be held responsible for the perceptions
of the media, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political analyst who was
a top aide to former president B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks had created unnecessarily a sense of
nervousness and uncertainty, including a surge of coup rumors to
which Wahid had himself contributed directly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are the losers here,'' she said of the president and the
general. ``And it was quite unnecessary. And it could all have been
done in a more dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the president had stated that one reason he
wanted the general to resign was to strengthen confidence among
foreign investors and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect, in the short term at least, may have been the
opposite. Jakarta's stock exchange and the value of its currency
have slipped during the past two weeks and some analysts said they
expected further slippage in the coming week following the seeming
retreat by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his seemingly impulsive verbal fits and starts, however,
there is a consistent direction to the president's policies, toward
democracy, openness, tolerance and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to rule by fiat, Wahid is revolutionizing leadership
in Indonesia after 32 years of autocratic rule by former president
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   By delegating the outcome of his standoff with Wiranto to his
highly respected attorney general, the president seemed to be
subordinating both the executive and the military to the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
   But then on Sunday, in a style that continues to keep
Indonesians off balance, he seemed to have a late-night change of
mind.

EDITORIAL: SUHARTO AS SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 14:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During his 32-year rule over Indonesia, former President Suharto
is widely believed to have amassed billions of dollars in illegal
wealth for himself, his children and his political cronies. An
investigation of Suharto was one of the loudest demands of
opponents whose demonstrations helped bring an end to his
military-backed dictatorship in May 1998. But until now, no serious
effort had been made to bring Suharto to account.
</P>
<P>
   So the announcement last week that Indonesia's new government
named Suharto as a suspect in a widening corruption inquiry came as
encouraging news. It is further evidence that President Abdurrahman
Wahid is taking seriously the importance of coming to terms with
past abuses as he tries to construct a new democratic society based
on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation of Suharto carried out by his successor and
friend, B.J. Habibie, was half-hearted and ultimately was dropped.
The decision to abandon the case contributed to Habibie's defeat in
last year's election. The new attorney general, Marzuki Darusman,
is examining whether Suharto laundered millions of dollars through
charitable organizations he owned. Investigators also want to
question Suharto about monopolies in cloves and fruits that were
run by his children.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyers say their client is too infirm to face
prosecution. The former president, 78, was hospitalized twice last
year after suffering a stroke. It will be for Indonesian courts to
weigh that claim if charges are filed. Wahid may have been
premature in promising to pardon Suharto if he is convicted, but
the issue before Indonesia is not so much whether Suharto spends
time in prison as whether the law applies equally to all citizens.
His conviction, if warranted by the evidence, would affirm that
principle.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law must also apply to General Wiranto, Indonesia's
most powerful military figure. A government human rights commission
recently found him responsible for much of the violence carried out
by pro-Indonesian militias on East Timor last year. Sunday, Wahid
initially dropped his demand for Wiranto's immediate resignation
from the cabinet, saying he would wait until the attorney general
determined whether to indict him. Hours later Wahid suspended the
general. The human rights commission's findings were sufficient
grounds to dismiss Wiranto. The continued development of democracy
in Indonesia requires that Suharto and Wiranto be held accountable
for any proven misconduct.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S MISSING FACILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 14:
</P>
<P>
   A decade would seem to be an excessive amount of time to wait
for public toilets in New York City. But as Clyde Haberman reminded
us in Friday's New York Times, this somewhat mysterious delay has
left many New Yorkers and perhaps even more tourists stranded
without some of the most basic facilities of a civilized world.
</P>
<P>
   Several mayors have circled this problem but never found a
solution. The plan that disappeared about three years ago under
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's watch would have added toilets to small
public oases around the city, where a visitor could use the phone,
buy a newspaper, wait for the bus or use a modern outdoor privy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, when the mayor asked the City Council to extend a
contract for bus shelters, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone
announced he also wanted some $5 million for about 50 public
toilets. The proposal is still in the concept stage, Vallone's
office reports, but the idea was to think less grandly at the
start.
</P>
<P>
   How this would be done is still a mystery, both at the council
and in the mayor's offices. But if both the mayor and the speaker
want toilets, as one aide suggests, the whole thing could
presumably hapen pretty quickly, perhaps by the end of the summer.
As late as that is, it is worth the effort. The powers at City Hall
ought to ensure that a necessity finally becomes a reality on the
streets of New York City.

   Slinging Mud Among the Palmettos
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush won in Delaware, but Sen. John McCain got 25
percent of the vote and never even showed up. Meanwhile, the two
are getting down and dirtier as South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary
looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending lavishly on ads that portray him,
wouldn't you know, as a maverick, George's boy and the endorsee of
Dan Quayle. He is now cast as ``a reformer with results.'' Bush has
taken to calling McCain ``the Chairman,'' depicting him as someone
who mouths reform while cozying up to lobbyists with interests
before the commerce panel he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to destroy McCain's image as someone who stands up
to the special interests, someone who possesses strength of
character, a trait not usually associated with inside-the-beltway
types.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the independent voters in New Hampshire saw McCain,
and they turned out in large numbers. They may be a big factor in
the Palmetto State, as well, and Bush must either dampen their
enthusiasm or transfer their starry-eyed loyalty to himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, striking back, is running ads comparing Bush to
President Clinton, and has been accusing the Bush campaign of
so-called push-polling, a practice where voters are called and fed
negative information about a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denies any involvement and McCain's supporters worry that
all the skirmishing over tactics will depress turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It's bound to get worse in the lead up to Tuesday's GOP debate.
Steve Forbes, who dropped out after a poor showing in Delaware,
won't be there to kick or kick around anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, money talks, and won't shut up. Some of Bush's big
backers grumble that the $37 million he's spent so far hasn't
bought much, but they aren't bolting yet. McCain raised more than
$2.2 million on the Internet and starred at a fund-raising event in
Washington studded with lobbyists, some of whom wore ``McCain voted
against my bill'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats don't get to vote in a primary of their own until
March 7. Vice President Al Gore lavished attention on California
and went on Jay Leno, while Bill Bradley plans to run an
endorsement ad from Michael Jordan.

   The Return of Mortadella &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the traditional pork sausage of Bologna,
mortadella, was as illegal in the United States as Cuban cigars
and, accordingly, just as valued by connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella lovers have been known to sneak the delicacy past
U.S. customs inside metal containers to hide the scent from
meat-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   To advance trade negotiations with the increasingly intransigent
European Union, the Agriculture Department lifted its ban, a
long-awaited reversal that was greeted in Italy as a moral
vindication along the lines of the exoneration of Alfred Dreyfus.
Italian pork products were banned in America after an outbreak of
African swine fever in Italy in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella costs more than twice as much in Italy as
American-made bologna, and Italian producers say that most
Americans have no idea what the real thing tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even try it,'' Rino Brini, 80, a co-founder of the
Alcisa pork factory in Bologna, said of American bologna. ``It
looks so sad.''

   A Setback in North Ireland After Delay in Disarmament  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 weeks after it began, the power-sharing government of
Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland came to an end,
aborted by the continuing conflict over the issue of paramilitary
weapons. Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said
he acted because the Irish Republican Army refused to give any sign
that it was going to dismantle its arsenal. He expected the
government to return ``on an even firmer footing,'' he said, if the
long-running dispute could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, tried to
deflect blame for the action, saying the breakdown increased the
complications surrounding guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   1990s' Productivity Makes It Best Decade Since 1960s
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s economic expansion, now the longest expansion in the
nation's history, draws its staying power from various wells _ the
two most important being the booming stock market and labor's
rising efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market makes people feel wealthy, encouraging them to
spend. To help satisfy this rising demand, America's workers are
managing to produce more goods and services in each hour of work.
Their rising output keeps the economy growing and plays a big role
in extending the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows just why workers have become more productive
in recent years, or for how long they will continue to grow more
efficient, as they did in the last six months of 1999. The Labor
Department announced last week that productivity, or output per
hour, had risen at an annual rate of 5 percent from June through
December, the best performance in seven years. And the expansion
marches on.

   Hijacking Ends
</P>
<P>
   The four-day hijacking of an Afghan airliner at Stansted Airport
outside of London ended peacefully and with no injuries when the
hijackers surrendered unconditionally on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half the people on the plane, Afghans who had been
on a domestic flight from Kabul when the Ariana Airlines Boeing 727
was seized, asked for political asylum. The Home Office pledged to
decide their cases as soon as possible, with a view toward ejecting
the Afghans from Britain. Twenty-two people were arrested and will
be charged under hijacking and terrorism laws.

   A brutal police corruption scandal that had largely been
contained to one anti-gang unit is now threatening to engulf the
Los Angeles Police Department, with the district attorney having
declared for the first time that the investigation has broadened to
other police divisions and that the police have been dragging their
feet.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 40 tainted cases now overturned, the new
disclosures of abuse have led to demands for an outside
investigation, perhaps by federal prosecutors.

   Big Bang Reproduced Small  &QL;

<P>
   The birth of the universe is looking less mysterious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Geneva announced that they had recreated a bizarre
form of matter that probably filled the entire universe when it was
a mere 10 millionths of a second old and expanding as a fireball.
The scientists, at the CERN particle physics laboratory, succeeded
in getting the reclusive particles called quarks to roam freely for
the first time in an experiment. Quarks are normally locked inside
protons and neutrons and cannot be knocked loose.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement could help scientists understand what ignited
the Big Bang explosion that they believe created the universe in
the first place.

   Getting a Day in Court
</P>
<P>
   Victims of gay-bashing, wife-beating and other crimes based on
gender or sexual orientation could have an easier time in court if
the Illinois General Assembly approves a bill introduced in the
House of Representatives that would enable them to sue any person,
company or organization responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is modeled on the federal Violence Against Women Act, a
1994 law that enables women to sue their attackers in federal
court. The Illinois law would extend similar protections to crime
victims singled out because of their sexual orientation or gender.
The Supreme Court is now considering a challenge to the federal
law; the main issue is whether jurisdiction for such laws should
lie with the states.

   Adjusted Auction Fees
</P>
<P>
   Faced with class-action lawsuits and a three-year-old antitrust
investigation into possible collusion between Sotheby's and
Christie's, the world's two largest auction houses, Christie's said
it was changing its fees. The English-based house has raised its
buyer's commissions, charging 17.5 percent on the first $80,000 and
10 percent of any amount over that. Since 1993 both Christie's and
its archrival Sotheby's charged buyers 15 percent for the first
$50,000 and 10 percent for everything after that.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may now be pricier to buy at Christie's, the company
is making it cheaper to sell. Previously, sellers paid a fixed
scale ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent. Now it will give
customers who buy a lot of art cheaper rates when they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is expected follow suit.

   When the Food and Drug Administration recently announced that
dietary supplements could be marketed for morning sickness, experts
in birth defects were outraged. They reminded the agency of how, in
the 1960s, it refused to approve thalidomide, a drug that maimed
thousands of babies whose mothers took it overseas. The arguments
worked; the FDA forbade supplement manufacturers from marketing to
pregnant women until the risks can be studied.

   A high school gay tolerance group in the conservative community
of Orange, Calif., held its first meeting in school Wednesday over
the objections of the school district, which argues that the club
should be banned because its issues of sexuality are inappropriate.
On Thursday, school officials banned noncurricular clubs in
elementary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   Until the matter is settled in court, a federal court order
enables the students to continue meeting. In the meantime, school
officials are considering new requirements for participation in
noncurricular clubs in high school organizations.

   Sick, reviled and in seclusion, former President Suharto of
Indonesia faces a legal threat from the government, which said it
would charge him for corruption in the amassing of illegal wealth.
The government's move seemed part of a serious effort to come to
terms with the abuses of the past.

A MIDDLE EAST VERSION OF `YOU'VE GOT MAIL' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Perched on the border between Syria and the
Israeli-held Golan Heights is a divided town where relatives take
up a megaphone once a week to shout out news to one another across
the disputed terrain. When the leaders of each country recently
wanted to send a message to one another after the breakdown of
peace talks, they used their own ``shouting valley.'' It is called
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly fighting in Lebanon in the past week _ escalating
from Hezbollah ambushes and rocket attacks to bombs dropped from
Israeli aircraft on electrical generating plants _ is a familiar
manifestation of a peculiarly Middle Eastern form of communication
between governments.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians in Lebanon and northern Israel, of course, pay the
bills, which come in the form of scars from flying glass, ruined
houses, loss of electricity in mid-winter, days and nights spent in
underground shelters, and corpses. They must wonder: wouldn't a
phone call, a poison pen letter or e-mail work as well?
</P>
<P>
   There may be no logical answer to that question. This is the way
Syria and a succession of Israeli prime ministers have messaged
each other for years. Across the battered land of Lebanon they have
set loose their proxies in the militant Hezbollah, a militia whose
supply lines are controlled by Damascus, and in the
Israeli-supported South Lebanon Army, whose mercenaries shield
Israel's northern border. (Responses are not limited to proxies.
That's where Israel's air force comes in.)
</P>
<P>
   But this latest lethal dialogue is not exactly like so many
previous outbreaks of killing in Lebanon. The message from Syria
this time appears aimed directly at the Israeli public and
specifically at those who say they want to hold on to the Golan
Heights even at the cost of a peace treaty. Brutal but clear, it is
a reminder from the Syrian president, Hafez Assad, that Syria
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's bombardment of targets all over Lebanon was equally
clear. It warned Damascus that pushing Israel too far would risk
military humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   It is instructive to examine the sequence of events. In
mid-January, negotiations at Shepherdstown, W.Va., between Syria's
foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, and the Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, ended with no agreement and with sour feelings on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Israelis opposed to a peace treaty that includes
a full return of the Golan Heights to Syria held a mass
demonstration. That protest was broadcast on television sets in
living rooms across Syria and it was presented to Syrians, who are
unfamiliar with the push and pull of interest groups in a
democracy, as a proof that the Israeli government was not really
interested in letting go of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus a few weeks ago, one hard-line government official
expressed this view when he dismissed the notion that Barak may
want to make a deal but can only do so with the support of a
majority of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could also get 100,000 people on the street to protest
against the peace,'' he said, adding with pride that Assad is
confident enough of his position to make peace anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Syrian leadership, there are more sophisticated
people who understand that Barak must take into account Israeli
public opinion. One way to interpret the Hezbollah activity since
the breakdown of Syrian-Israeli peace talks is as a message to
those hesitant Israelis. In essence, it is this: You cannot ignore
Syria if you want security in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's actions have always sent a similar message: Peace is
peace and no peace is no peace. There is no half-way point between
the two that will guarantee a good night's sleep every night to
Israelis living in towns and settlements close to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a given that Israel would respond forcefully to the
Hezbollah attacks that have killed seven of its soldiers over the
last two weeks, as well as the second-in-command of the South
Lebanon Army. Again, that is part of the calculation in this
murderous discourse.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when the tit-for-tat violence reached a certain
intensity, the United States would step in. This served Syrian
officials, who have long preferred to have Washington intimately
involved as a referee and go-between in any dealings with Israel.
The reactions of Syria's government-owned newspapers last week
underlined the point. The solution to the violence in Lebanon, they
maintained, is immediate American intervention.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a roundabout and costly way to get back to
the bargaining table, it is. ``This was an escalation with the
intent to reactivate the peace process,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a
military analyst in Cairo and a former Egyptian diplomat. ``But it
could get out of hand.''

   Slinging Mud Among the Palmettos
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush won in Delaware, but Sen. John McCain got 25
percent of the vote and never even showed up. Meanwhile, the two
are getting down and dirtier as South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary
looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending lavishly on ads that portray him,
wouldn't you know, as a maverick, George's boy and the endorsee of
Dan Quayle. He is now cast as ``a reformer with results.'' Bush has
taken to calling McCain ``the Chairman,'' depicting him as someone
who mouths reform while cozying up to lobbyists with interests
before the commerce panel he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to destroy McCain's image as someone who stands up
to the special interests, someone who possesses strength of
character, a trait not usually associated with inside-the-beltway
types.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the independent voters in New Hampshire saw McCain,
and they turned out in large numbers. They may be a big factor in
the Palmetto State, as well, and Bush must either dampen their
enthusiasm or transfer their starry-eyed loyalty to himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, striking back, is running ads comparing Bush to
President Clinton, and has been accusing the Bush campaign of
so-called push-polling, a practice where voters are called and fed
negative information about a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denies any involvement and McCain's supporters worry that
all the skirmishing over tactics will depress turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It's bound to get worse in the lead up to Tuesday's GOP debate.
Steve Forbes, who dropped out after a poor showing in Delaware,
won't be there to kick or kick around anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, money talks, and won't shut up. Some of Bush's big
backers grumble that the $37 million he's spent so far hasn't
bought much, but they aren't bolting yet. McCain raised more than
$2.2 million on the Internet and starred at a fund-raising event in
Washington studded with lobbyists, some of whom wore ``McCain voted
against my bill'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats don't get to vote in a primary of their own until
March 7. Vice President Al Gore lavished attention on California
and went on Jay Leno, while Bill Bradley plans to run an
endorsement ad from Michael Jordan.

   The Return of Mortadella &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the traditional pork sausage of Bologna,
mortadella, was as illegal in the United States as Cuban cigars
and, accordingly, just as valued by connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella lovers have been known to sneak the delicacy past
U.S. customs inside metal containers to hide the scent from
meat-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   To advance trade negotiations with the increasingly intransigent
European Union, the Agriculture Department lifted its ban, a
long-awaited reversal that was greeted in Italy as a moral
vindication along the lines of the exoneration of Alfred Dreyfus.
Italian pork products were banned in America after an outbreak of
African swine fever in Italy in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella costs more than twice as much in Italy as
American-made bologna, and Italian producers say that most
Americans have no idea what the real thing tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even try it,'' Rino Brini, 80, a co-founder of the
Alcisa pork factory in Bologna, said of American bologna. ``It
looks so sad.''

   A Setback in North Ireland After Delay in Disarmament  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 weeks after it began, the power-sharing government of
Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland came to an end,
aborted by the continuing conflict over the issue of paramilitary
weapons. Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said
he acted because the Irish Republican Army refused to give any sign
that it was going to dismantle its arsenal. He expected the
government to return ``on an even firmer footing,'' he said, if the
long-running dispute could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, tried to
deflect blame for the action, saying the breakdown increased the
complications surrounding guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   1990s' Productivity Makes It Best Decade Since 1960s
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s economic expansion, now the longest expansion in the
nation's history, draws its staying power from various wells _ the
two most important being the booming stock market and labor's
rising efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market makes people feel wealthy, encouraging them to
spend. To help satisfy this rising demand, America's workers are
managing to produce more goods and services in each hour of work.
Their rising output keeps the economy growing and plays a big role
in extending the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows just why workers have become more productive
in recent years, or for how long they will continue to grow more
efficient, as they did in the last six months of 1999. The Labor
Department announced last week that productivity, or output per
hour, had risen at an annual rate of 5 percent from June through
December, the best performance in seven years. And the expansion
marches on.

   Hijacking Ends

<P>
   The four-day hijacking of an Afghan airliner at Stansted Airport
outside of London ended peacefully and with no injuries when the
hijackers surrendered unconditionally on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half the people on the plane, Afghans who had been
on a domestic flight from Kabul when the Ariana Airlines Boeing 727
was seized, asked for political asylum. The Home Office pledged to
decide their cases as soon as possible, with a view toward ejecting
the Afghans from Britain. Twenty-two people were arrested and will
be charged under hijacking and terrorism laws.

   With more than 40 tainted cases now overturned, the new

   The birth of the universe is looking less mysterious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Geneva announced that they had recreated a bizarre
form of matter that probably filled the entire universe when it was
a mere 10 millionths of a second old and expanding as a fireball.
The scientists, at the CERN particle physics laboratory, succeeded
in getting the reclusive particles called quarks to roam freely for
the first time in an experiment. Quarks are normally locked inside
protons and neutrons and cannot be knocked loose.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement could help scientists understand what ignited
the Big Bang explosion that they believe created the universe in

   Getting a Day in Court
</P>
<P>
   Victims of gay-bashing, wife-beating and other crimes based on
gender or sexual orientation could have an easier time in court if
the Illinois General Assembly approves a bill introduced in the
House of Representatives that would enable them to sue any person,
company or organization responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is modeled on the federal Violence Against Women Act, a
1994 law that enables women to sue their attackers in federal
court. The Illinois law would extend similar protections to crime
victims singled out because of their sexual orientation or gender.
The Supreme Court is now considering a challenge to the federal
law; the main issue is whether jurisdiction for such laws should
lie with the states.

   Adjusted Auction Fees
</P>
<P>
   Faced with class-action lawsuits and a three-year-old antitrust
investigation into possible collusion between Sotheby's and
Christie's, the world's two largest auction houses, Christie's said
it was changing its fees. The English-based house has raised its
buyer's commissions, charging 17.5 percent on the first $80,000 and
10 percent of any amount over that. Since 1993 both Christie's and
its archrival Sotheby's charged buyers 15 percent for the first
$50,000 and 10 percent for everything after that.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may now be pricier to buy at Christie's, the company
is making it cheaper to sell. Previously, sellers paid a fixed
scale ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent. Now it will give
customers who buy a lot of art cheaper rates when they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is expected follow suit.

the 1960s, it refused to approve thalidomide, a drug that maimed
thousands of babies whose mothers took it overseas. The arguments
worked; the FDA forbade supplement manufacturers from marketing to
pregnant women until the risks can be studied.

<P>
   &UR; WHILE I WAS GONE &LR;  By Sue Miller. Ballantine, $12.95. The
heroine of this fictional meditation on marital fidelity is a New
England veterinarian torn between her complex feelings for her
husband (a minister) and her equally complex fantasies about
another man (an old housemate). The result is ``a beautiful and
frightening book, one that many readers will find it difficult to
forget,'' Jay Parini wrote in The New York Times Book Review last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THROWIM WAY LEG: Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds _ On
the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea &LR;  By Tim
Flannery. Grove, $14. A celebrated Australian scientist recounts
his many long research excursions into the wilds of New Guinea,
harrowing journeys during which he encountered cannibals, ghastly
diseases, a giant gold mine, shrieking frogs and a hungry 10-foot
black python. He still managed to identify at least 17 new species
of mammals. ```Throwim Way Leg' is more than an account of his
fieldwork,'' D.J.R. Bruckner wrote last year. ``It is an
enthralling introduction to the mountain people of New Guinea _
unimaginably remote, charming, cunning, cruel, subtle and appealing
_ and to their magnificent land.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ORIGINAL BLISS &LR;  By A.L. Kennedy. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
In this novel, a Scottish woman, suffering from a loss of faith and
hungry for love and human touch not to be had from her brutish
husband, falls into a dark romance with a pop-psych guru. ``Kennedy
is a world-class fiction writer'' whose ``characters inhabit her
text in full flesh,'' Thomas Lynch wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RAY CHARLES: Man and Music &LR;  By Michael Lydon. Riverhead,
$14.95. This biography seeks to portray the many faces of the
rhythm-and-blues legend: drug addict, womanizer, blind man, black
man, self-reliant businessman and, above all, musical genius. Last
year the reviewer Nelson George praised ``Lydon's dogged detailing
of Charles' rise, triumphs and bittersweet old age.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SINGERS AND THE SONG II &LR; , by Gene Lees (Oxford University,
$15.95), combines material from the author's 1987 collection of
essays on jazz and popular song, including profiles of Frank
Sinatra and Peggy Lee, with seven new essays on Ella Fitzgerald and
other artists of the pre-rock era. ``The earlier pieces have been
expanded ... to good effect,'' Terry Teachout wrote in 1998,
``while the later ones are of uniformly high quality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY GERMAN QUESTION: Growing Up in Nazi Berlin &LR;  By Peter Gay.
Yale University, $10.95. A cultural historian and Freudian scholar
recalls his youth in 1930s Berlin as part of a Jewish family who
believed themselves to be virtually assimilated. In 1998 the
reviewer Frank Kermode called Gay ``a quietly remarkable character,
civilized, learned, yet incapable of wholly forgetting or forgiving
the hideous cruelties that threatened his life as a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREEDOM SONG: Three Novels &LR;  By Amit Chaudhuri. Vintage
International, $14. These three willfully plotless narratives
explore the allure of everyday life in Calcutta, Bombay and Oxford.
``Chaudhuri is an immensely gifted writer,'' Alice Truax wrote last
year. His novels are ``crammed with breathtaking sentences ... and
melancholy grace notes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SISTER OF MY HEART &LR; , by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni (Anchor,
$13), is the tale of two cousins who grow up in the same
upper-class Calcutta household and whose lives diverge after they
are forced into arranged marriages. In 1999 the reviewer Anderson
Tepper called this an uneven novel but admired ``Banerjee's
poetically embroidered storytelling powers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MR. DARWIN'S SHOOTER &LR;  By Roger McDonald. Penguin, $13.95.
Charles Darwin's assistant aboard the Beagle is portrayed as a
devout sailor who becomes embittered by Darwin's failure to
recognize his contributions to ``The Origin of Species'' and
worried that the scientist was out to prove there is no God. The
result is a ``fully imagined'' novel ``imbued with intellectual
curiosity,'' Emily Barton wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOING TO MIAMI: Exiles, Tourists and Refugees in the New
America &LR;  By David Rieff. University Press of Florida, $14.95. This
civic portrait captures a melting pot in full boil, a city of
competing ethnic communities in the process of being transformed by
its Cuban exile population. ``Rieff gives Miami the treatment it
deserves: an anti-travelogue that tours states of mind and basks in
projected images,'' John Krich wrote in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAVING GRACES: Images of Women in European Cemeteries &LR;  By David
Robinson. Norton, $15.95. The wilting, swooning maidens depicted in
this collection of black-and-white images of mostly 19th-century
statuary embody the Romantic link between love and death. ``The
photographs are beautiful, and beautifully reproduced,'' Sarah
Ferrell wrote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERONICA &LR;  By Nicholas Christopher. Spike/Avon, $12.50. This
tale of a New York photographer who is recruited by the daughter of
a time-traveling magician to rescue her missing father is ``a hip,
sexy, trendy fantasy novel,'' David Guy wrote in 1996.
``Christopher is a superbly lyrical and descriptive writer.''

   In Damascus a few weeks ago, one hard-line government official
expressed this view when he dismissed the notion that Barak may
want to make a deal but can only do so with the support of a
majority of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could also get 100,000 people on the street to protest
against the peace,'' he said, adding with pride that Assad is
confident enough of his position to make peace anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Syrian leadership, there are more sophisticated
people who understand that Barak must take into account Israeli
public opinion. One way to interpret the Hezbollah activity since

Syria if you want security in northern Israel.

   Assad's actions have always sent a similar message: Peace is
peace and no peace is no peace. There is no half-way point between
the two that will guarantee a good night's sleep every night to
Israelis living in towns and settlements close to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a given that Israel would respond forcefully to the
Hezbollah attacks that have killed seven of its soldiers over the
last two weeks, as well as the second-in-command of the South
Lebanon Army. Again, that is part of the calculation in this
murderous discourse.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when the tit-for-tat violence reached a certain
intensity, the United States would step in. This served Syrian
officials, who have long preferred to have Washington intimately
involved as a referee and go-between in any dealings with Israel.
The reactions of Syria's government-owned newspapers last week
underlined the point. The solution to the violence in Lebanon, they
maintained, is immediate American intervention.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a roundabout and costly way to get back to
the bargaining table, it is. ``This was an escalation with the
intent to reactivate the peace process,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a
military analyst in Cairo and a former Egyptian diplomat. ``But it
could get out of hand.''

   VOTING-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pity the poor strategist for
a presidential campaign. He is trying to cobble together a cohesive
national strategy that appeals to an electorate so diverse, so
stratified, so much in flux as to make the Tower of Babel look tame
and unified by comparison. Unlike past elections no one group seems
key. Each seems important. It's a niche marketer's dream, and a
pundit's nightmare.There are many reasons why both demographically
and attitudinally today's electorate seems more pluribus than unum.
By Steven Holmes. (also moved in `p' category)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PROFESSORS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Universities have
suddenly realized that distance learning, or the offering of
classes via the Internet, could create companies that might compete
with universities for students, tuition and faculty, and render the
``brick and mortar'' school obsolete. Academics and their
institutions are already squaring off over who owns the rights to
professors' lectures and research, and who is entitled to collect
royalties on the electronic dissemination of them. By Jacques
Steinberg with Edward Wyatt.

   INTERNET-PROFITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Few Internet companies have

Like the TV industry, which benefits from dot-com advertising. And
inflated stock prices have created billions in new private assets,
which in turn have emptied luxury-car showrooms. The paradox of
capital flowing every which way but into the black for the Internet
companies themselves isn't all that surprising. After all, money
has has to go somewhere. By Kate Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Political analysts and
strategists have long argued that that the enormous advantages
enjoyed by big-money establishment candidates could be counteracted
if an insurgent candidate harnessed the Internet's power to
communicate interactively with voters. John McCain and his cyber
fund-raisers may prove them right. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE-MISSIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mission statements _
distilled essences of corporate goals _ will never be confused with
Shakespeare. Yet they have become poetry to executive ears, sonnets
to shareholder value, so much so that 86 percent of U.S.
corporations have their own carefully worded, neatly printed,
widely disseminated statements. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   DIAMONDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Feeling extra guilt-tripped this
Valentine's Day, big spender? It's not your imagination. Inflation
may be under control, but it doesn't look that way in the diamond
business _ and certainly not in those rarefied realms where size of
heart is conspicuously if not touchingly linked to size of wallet.
By Monique P. Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCHING-REVIEW (New York) _ Reflections on a photo exhibit
dealing with lynching, which still haunts America's collective
psyche and continues to be used as stinging metaphor for a profound
injustice. By Michel Marriot.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PENALTY-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the efforts
of several states to prevent wrongful executions by arranging for
special defense lawyers in capital cases. By Richard Perez Pena.
</P>
<P>
   VILE-VALENTINES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Valentine's Day is a
time for champagne, roses and sappy expressions of affection. But
such sentiments are no match for the venom that gets spewed when
romance goes sour. Herewith some notable authors demonstrate their
ability to wield the poison pen.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-LEFTISTS-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ There still is an
activist left in Latin America, still deeply resentful over
inequality and poverty and undemocratic government. But just think
how different the recent strike at the University of Mexico was
from what it might have been, say, 15 years ago. The students said
they were victims of a new worldwide economic system, but this new
demon _ globalism _ was faceless. It was a product more of
corporations than governments, of trade more than armies, and it
was emerging everywhere at once, with no clear alternative in
sight. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Cairo) _ Violence is the way Syria and
Israel have messaged each other for years _ across the battered
land of Lebanon _ by setting loose their proxies in the Hezbollah
militia, whose supply lines are controlled by Damascus, and in the
Israeli-supported South Lebanon Army, which shields Israel's
northern border. But the latest lethal conversation is not exactly
like many other outbreaks of killing in Lebanon. The message from
Syria this time appears aimed directly at the Israeli public. By
Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-PRESS-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ In the nearly two years since
Indonesia's strongman, Suharto, stepped down in 1998, the press has
been the most free, and the most tumultuous, of Indonesia's
institutions. It has been the fundamental underpinning for the
continuing move toward a democratic society. But in many ways today
it is also in trouble, and its condition reveals a lot about the
chaotic freedoms of the new Indonesia, where the harsh hand of the
dictator has often given way to the unpredictable passions of the
mob. By Seth Mydans.

   VOTING-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pity the poor strategist for
a presidential campaign. He is trying to cobble together a cohesive
national strategy that appeals to an electorate so diverse, so
stratified, so much in flux as to make the Tower of Babel look tame
and unified by comparison. Unlike past elections no one group seems
key. Each seems important. It's a niche marketer's dream, and a
pundit's nightmare.There are many reasons why both demographically
and attitudinally today's electorate seems more pluribus than unum.
By Steven Holmes. (also moved in `p' category)

<P>
   INTERNET-PROFESSORS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Universities have
suddenly realized that distance learning, or the offering of
classes via the Internet, could create companies that might compete
with universities for students, tuition and faculty, and render the
``brick and mortar'' school obsolete. Academics and their
institutions are already squaring off over who owns the rights to
professors' lectures and research, and who is entitled to collect
royalties on the electronic dissemination of them. By Jacques
Steinberg with Edward Wyatt.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Feb. 5 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

   ``A card and some flowers? That's so 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   _ DeBeers magazine advertisement
</P>
<P>
   Feeling extra guilt-tripped this Valentine's Day, big spender?
It's not your imagination. Alan Greenspan may have inflation under
control, but it doesn't look that way in the diamond business _ and
certainly not in those rarefied realms where size of heart is
conspicuously if not touchingly linked to size of wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Poor men with bucks. They don't stand a chance, not with the
world's largest producer of diamonds, DeBeers, spending $60 million
this year just to advertise its rocks, often with ego-taunting
slogans like, ``Give her something that won't wilt in a week.'' Now
that's cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Love has always had its mercenary aspects, but in this booming
economy they have been starkly magnified. On Tuesday, for example,
Fox is airing ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' in which
50 female contestants will be whittled down, beauty pageant style,
to five finalists, all in wedding gowns, one of whom will be
proposed to and married on the air, live, by a willing millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing refracts the current climate like the diamond. Last
week the diamond retailer Mondera kicked off its Web site,
Mondera.com, with a bash at the Havana Club at Top of the Sixes in
New York. There diamond-draped models mingled with Wall Street
brokers, Upper East Side bachelors and James Gandolfini _ TV's Tony
Soprano _ as the guys partook of single-malt scotches, cigars,
straight-razor shaves and shoeshines.
</P>
<P>
   All the pampering and advertising seem to be paying off. ``The
diamond market is up 12 percent,'' said Joan Parker, the director
of the diamond information center at J. Walter Thompson, DeBeers'
advertising agency. Another key indicator _ DeBeers sales of rough
diamonds _ surged 57 percent last year to a record $5.24 billion,
up from $3.35 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The upward trend is not lost on women in certain circles. Take
Anna Rothschild, a 31-year-old Manhattanite just getting divorced
from her second husband. Her first, a stockbroker, gave her a
five-carat, round diamond set in platinum from Harry Winston. Her
second husband gave her a six-carat, emerald-cut diamond with
trilliums on the side. She designed it with him at a private
jeweler (cost: about $75,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' Rothschild said, ``I would have preferred 10
carats.'' But husband No. 2, an English businessman, ``thought that
was vulgar and inappropriate. He wanted a more understated type of
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, Rothschild said, ``I would like at least an
8-carat canary diamond. They are much more rare than just a regular
diamond, and I've tried on my friends' rings and I know it looks
good on my finger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``See, if you're medium-boned, even four carats can look small
on your body,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, engagement rings of four carats or more are not
uncommon in Upper East Side social circles, and many women echo
Rothschild's view that a smaller diamond might get lost visually on
a woman of any heft. At Tiffany, for example, insiders were
horrified that Jerry Seinfeld only bought a two-carat ring for his
new bride, Jessica Sklar. ``Couldn't he afford more? Really,'' said
one employee, who didn't want to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just about size. It's about cut too. Both the
emerald cut (rectangular) and the once-rare asscher cut are popular
now. The asscher cut yields a very deep stone and is considered
more understated _ as if to say, ``I have more substance than
flash.''.
</P>
<P>
   Muffie Potter-Aston, an executive vice president of Van Cleef &AMP;
Arpels, has an asscher-cut diamond of over 15 carats. She says her
husband, a plastic surgeon, Sherrell Aston, ``loves me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Men are clearly feeling the pressure. Mark Simone, a Manhattan
bachelor and cable television host, said, ``I see guys buy
zillion-dollar rings because it's a big blinking neon sign that
says, `I got a lot of money.''' Most women he knows want rings ``as
big as an ashtray,'' he said. And men deliver. ``The women spend 20
minutes talking about the ring and three minutes talking about how
they met the guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're a poor sap who can only afford, say, a carat?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, I don't meet anyone like that,'' said Rothschild,
who nevertheless feels she must refrain from diamond-wearing for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want men to think I'm married,'' she said. ``How will
I meet my third husband?''

IF IT'S THE INTERNET, DOWN MUST BE UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet got some really bad news last week, so naturally it
was really good news too. Sure, cyber-hackers paralyzed a number of
powerhouse Web sites, including Amazon.com, Yahoo and eBay. But now
Internet security consultants find themselves doing a land-office
business.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with the new economy. Of the thousands of dot-com
companies now in existence, the number to have actually turned a
profit can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Yet there's
plenty of money being made by everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Like in TV: Internet companies accounted for nearly half the
advertisers on this year's Super Bowl broadcast, which commanded a
record $2.2 million on average for each 30-second spot. Before that
the Y2K troubleshooting industry cleaned up. And of course,
inflated stock prices have created billions in new private assets,
which in turn have emptied luxury-car showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow the industry say the paradox of capital flowing
every which way but into the black for the dot-coms isn't all that
surprising. After all, money has to go somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reminded of a famous passage from John Maynard Keynes'
`General Theory,''' said James Fallows, a columnist for the
Industry Standard, a weekly Internet-business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where he talks about how paying people to dig holes in
the ground, and fill them up, could actually make sense, because of
the virtue of getting all that money into circulation,'' he said
via e-mail. ``In a sense, this is a newly elegant flip on
Keynesianism: Pay people to start companies that never make money,
but that spreads a lot of money around to others in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't necessarily a permanent state of affairs, say
others. ``It's temporary,'' said Professor Donna L. Hoffman, the
co-director of the Electronic Commerce Research Laboratory at
Vanderbilt University. She noted that for now, much of the money is
going into infrastructure, including the development of Web sites;
it's going to businesses serving other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where people are making the money,'' she said. ``The
Internet is indeed profitable, but it's starting in the center and
moving outward.'' Eventually profits will be made in
business-to-consumer transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the present state of the new economy is
illustrated by the boom in security consulting sparked by last
week's cyber-sabotage. ``The first thing I thought when I heard the
news was, `I have to buy stock in security companies.''' Hoffman
said. ``The only question was, which one?''

</P>
<P>
   So it goes with the new economy. Of the thousands of dot-com
companies now in existence, the number to have actually turned a
profit can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Yet there's
plenty of money being made by everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Like in TV: Internet companies accounted for nearly half the
advertisers on this year's Super Bowl broadcast, which commanded a
record $2.2 million on average for each 30-second spot. Before that
the Y2K troubleshooting industry cleaned up. And of course,
inflated stock prices have created billions in new private assets,
which in turn have emptied luxury-car showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow the industry say the paradox of capital flowing
every which way but into the black for the dot-coms isn't all that
surprising. After all, money has to go somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reminded of a famous passage from John Maynard Keynes'
`General Theory,''' said James Fallows, a columnist for the
Industry Standard, a weekly Internet-business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where he talks about how paying people to dig holes in
the ground, and fill them up, could actually make sense, because of
the virtue of getting all that money into circulation,'' he said
via e-mail. ``In a sense, this is a newly elegant flip on
Keynesianism: Pay people to start companies that never make money,
but that spreads a lot of money around to others in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't necessarily a permanent state of affairs, say
others. ``It's temporary,'' said Professor Donna L. Hoffman, the
co-director of the Electronic Commerce Research Laboratory at
Vanderbilt University. She noted that for now, much of the money is
going into infrastructure, including the development of Web sites;
it's going to businesses serving other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where people are making the money,'' she said. ``The
Internet is indeed profitable, but it's starting in the center and
moving outward.'' Eventually profits will be made in
business-to-consumer transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the present state of the new economy is
illustrated by the boom in security consulting sparked by last
week's cyber-sabotage. ``The first thing I thought when I heard the
news was, `I have to buy stock in security companies.''' Hoffman
said. ``The only question was, which one?''

   Tomorrow Is Valentine's Day, a time for champagne, roses and
sappy expressions of affection.

<P>
   But such sentiments are no match for the venom that gets spewed
when romance turns sour. Herewith some notable authors demonstrate
their ability to wield the poison pen.

<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) With colon-punctuated bile, George Bernard
Shaw let fly at his paramour Stella Campbell in 1913 when she
announced that she would marry George Cornwallis West: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Bah! You have no nerve: you have no brain: you are the
caricature of an 18th century male sentimentalist. . . . ((Y))ou
know nothing. God help you, except what you know all wrong:
daylight blinds you: you run after life furtively and run away or
huddle up and scream when it turns and opens its arms to you: you
are a man's disgrace and infatuation, not his crown ``above
rubies'' . . . ((Y))ou are an owl, sickened by two days of my
sunshine: I have treated you far too well. . . . Go then: the
Shavian oxygen burns up your little lungs: seek some stuffiness
that suits you. You will not marry George! At the last moment you
will funk him or be ousted by a bolder soul. You have wounded my
vanity: an inconceivable audacity, an unpardonable crime.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell, wretch that I loved.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) You'd think Shaw had made his point with
the above. But the dramatist wasn't quite through with Stella. He
wrote her a follow-up letter the same day: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my rancor is not yet slaked: I have not said enough vile
things to you. What are you, miserable wretch, that my entrails
should be torn asunder hour after hour? . . . Come round me all the
good friends I have neglected for her. Even her slanderers shall be
welcome: I shall say, ``Spit your venom; heap up your lies; vomit
your malice until the air is poison: you will still fall short of
the truth.'' And to her friends, her dupes, her adorers, I will
say, ``All that you say is true and not half good enough for her;
and yet it is all nothing: she would tear the strings out of an
archangel's harp to tie up parcels: she has done that with my very
heart strings.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) James Thurber could dish it out too. Before
joining The New Yorker, he presaged his obsession with the war
between the sexes in this 1920 letter to his sweetheart, Eva Prout:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A woman is often a wonderful thing. . . . But in you, as in all
of them, is the indifference of Carmen, the joy in cruelty of
Cleopatra, the tyrannical marble-heartedness of Katherine de
Medici, and the cold glitter of all the passionless despots of
men's warm souls since sex first originated _ since Eve broke the
heart of humanity forever and laughed with sadistic joy at Adam
sweating blood on the rack she made for him. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming the ages of women gone before
you who handed such legacies down, blaming the radiant and
sparkling and fidgety ladies of history who kissed in a moment of
coquetry and saw men die, kings dethroned and nations fight in
blood because of that careless caress. Men are fools, weak,
wine-blooded, deeply-devoted darn fools. What have women done for
them ((that is)) half so intense and potent as what they have done
to them?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But women could give as good as they got,
as Dorothy L. Sayers showed. The mystery novelist as much as called
her ex-beau John Cournos a wimp for insisting on using birth
control, in a letter she wrote in 1925 after having an illegitimate
child with another man: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Give me a man that's human and careless and loves life, and one
who can enjoy the rough-and-tumble of passion. . . . I like to die
spitting and swearing, you know, and I'm no mean wrestler! But
there again _ Precautionary measures cramp the style. Bah! If you
had chosen, I would have given you three sons by this time _ but
you are one that will do your wooing and begetting by proxy. . . .
Now, which of us do you really think is the more cynical, O divine
Perfection?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In their long affair, Henry Miller and
Anais Nin pretty much personified hot and heavy. But after Miller
started badgering an indecisive Nin to join him in California in
1941, she called the sensualist rather a cold fish in one
department: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   You can do whatever pleases you, but your letters now sound
exactly like the letters you sent me from Greece, which almost
estranged us for good. They are cold, egotistical and concerned
purely with pleasure. All you can answer to my emotional attitude
when I think I can leave and then cannot leave is thoroughly
inhuman and mechanical. . . . Everything would be all right if you
wrote the right kind of letters. But you write the worst letters,
letters bad enough to estrange anyone. I have never seen more
expressionless, pan-faced letters, in regard to whether I come or
do not come etc. More self-centered letters either. That's what
creates distance, not time or a trip. The real distance and
separation were always created by your letters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Early in 1936, Sinclair Lewis sailed for
Bermuda without telling his wife, Dorothy Thompson. He then wrote
her a letter complaining about their unsatisfactory life together
in New York. She fired back: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ((I))f I ever pulled anything on you like that I would never
hear the last of it. . . . Your letter about New York, which was
really vituperative, all about I shouldn't interfere with your
life, and let you alone, etc., rather hurt my feelings. . . . You
are so terrible, so terrifying when you are angry. . . . When you
are like that you freeze something in me.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In his fiction, Ernest Hemingway often
conveyed emotion between the lines. But not in correspondence.
Shortly before marrying Martha Gellhorn, Papa in 1940 drew up a
crow-eating ``contract'' for her to sign, to atone for a recent
separation from him: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I, the undersigned Mrs. Martha, or Mrs. Fathouse Pig . . .
hereby guarantee and promise never to brutalize my present and
future husband in any way whatsoever. . . . I recognize that a very
fine and sensitive writer cannot be left alone 2 months and 16 days
during which time many trying and unlikely things are put upon him
voluntarily and involuntarily, and that I . . . was a great cause
for his uneasiness of mind during this long period of solitude . .
. I am deeply sorry therefore and shall attempt . . . to make up to
him for the wretchedness he has gone through and shall also attempt
to protect him against same wretchedness in the future. This
statement is given of my own free will and in my rightest mind and
with love.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And the poet Anne Sexton rebuffed the
romantic overtures of Philip Legler by suggesting in 1966 that he
seek professional help: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Phil baby, everyone is wrong here. Your love, your
abundance for me is partly sick. I can tell you this because I am
the healthiest, wisest sickest human you'll meet outside the nut
house (patient or doctor/nurse). The sanest thing in this world is
love. And what is important is honesty. . . . I feel in my heart
that if you concentrate (as you have been doing) on your Anne
Sexton campaign that you'll run off into a tornado. . . . You're
sick. You need help. . . .
</P>
<P>
   First, foremost, Phil, work out your constant need for
affection, closeness with students, or with this poet. . . . Phil,
take the pills and start on the road to growing. . . .

YOUNG AND ANARCHIC, THE ANGRY LEFT IS REBORN IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ During The Cold War, when Latin American leftists
gravitated toward communism, it was easy for them to identify their
enemies: local military dictators or U.S. corporate imperialists.
They had an economic system to demonize _ capitalism _ and an
alternative _ socialism _ to put in its place. And they had a
playbook, written by Marx and Lenin and Fidel Castro, to guide
their thinking and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But times are different. There still is an activist left in
Latin America, and it still does battle with inequality and poverty
and undemocratic government. But the recent nine-month strike at
Mexico's national university revealed a new kind of leftist
movement, one whose new foe is the global economy. The strike,
which devastated Mexico's most important university and divided its
society, gave a preview of the vexing challenges the new leftists
may pose to the region's young democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The striking students at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico declared that their fundamental purpose was to oppose the
worldwide spread of free trade and the lean government,
pro-business policies that promote it. But the conundrum for their
movement was that the new adversary _ globalism _ was faceless. It
was a product of commerce and technology more than of government or
guns. It was emerging everywhere at once, with no clear alternative
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   If the students were confronting anarchic change, they met it
with an anarchic movement. The strike steering committee took over
the campus, using barbed wire to keep other students out. They
elected no outstanding leaders and took their decisions in chaotic
all-night assemblies. Over the months the university conceded
demand after demand, but the strikers only upped the ante.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers confounded everyone who dealt with them, from
conciliatory university administrators to conservative
intellectuals to lifelong leftists. In the end, after the federal
police marched in on Feb. 6 and hauled the remaining strikers away
to jail, it seemed that the strike had been an end in itself, a
form of complete resistance against social and economic changes
they could never hope to control.
</P>
<P>
   The new leftism probably emerged in Mexico because this country
has led the charge in Latin America into the globalized age. Since
signing on to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico
has seen its international trade explode, its business middle class
rise like a phoenix and the country's northern half become an
industrial export powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the student strikers were also a product of globalization _
of two decades of policies that laid the foundations for Mexico's
recent leap into the global economy. The government has stimulated
growth by restraining inflation, mainly by depressing workers'
wages. Official figures show that the minimum wage today buys 48
percent of what it did in 1982. So, while export enclaves have
thrived, workers elsewhere have been drawn into a spiral of
downward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The national university, with 275,000 students, was once
Mexico's main avenue of social ascent. Today many students graduate
wondering if they will be able to earn a living. Alfonso Zarate, a
political analyst, said the strike revealed how much Mexico has
become ``a nation of winners and losers.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike was not radical at the start. It began last April, as
a protest against a plan to charge tuition _ about $150 a year _
for the first time in decades. The university president, Francisco
Barnes de Castro, cast the plan as an effort to get resources for a
critically underfunded institution. But in today's increasingly
impoverished urban working class, even small tuition costs can
break a family's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The new left gave the students a rationale for rejecting the
plan. It was a vast plot by the business-friendly government to
impose private sector logic on a public university, and deny
working class youth the education they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, a faction of strikers, dubbed ``ultras'' by their
companions because of their intolerance for dissent, gained the
upper hand through nasty purges. A central demand was for
face-to-face negotiations with the university president. But the
movement, once it was in the hands of the ultras, did not really
negotiate. The strikers never moved an inch from their original
demands. Administrators dropped the tuition plan, agreed to direct
talks, agreed even to hold a congress to reform how the whole
university was organized.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikers, true to their anarchist core and lacking
vision of an alternative, continued to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebellion is our only leader, our one true cause and the
reason for everything we do,'' read one banner.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Alvarez, an economics professor, at first supported
the strike but fell out with the ultras. ``They made distrust into
a form of politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the strike divided Mexico, which is in the midst of
a delicate move from authoritarianism to democracy. While the
general public applauded the police action to end the strike, many
intellectuals, journalists and democratic leaders saw it as an
extension of the bloody repression with which the student movement
of 1968 was broken. The result was some of the most vigorous street
protests Mexico has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to education and the division among Mexicans could
serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who thinks the changes that
globalization brings will only reinforce democratic institutions.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ During The Cold War, when Latin American leftists
gravitated toward communism, it was easy for them to identify their
enemies: local military dictators or U.S. corporate imperialists.
They had an economic system to demonize _ capitalism _ and an
alternative _ socialism _ to put in its place. And they had a
playbook, written by Marx and Lenin and Fidel Castro, to guide
their thinking and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But times are different. There still is an activist left in
Latin America, and it still does battle with inequality and poverty
and undemocratic government. But the recent nine-month strike at
Mexico's national university revealed a new kind of leftist
movement, one whose new foe is the global economy. The strike,
which devastated Mexico's most important university and divided its
society, gave a preview of the vexing challenges the new leftists
may pose to the region's young democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The striking students at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico declared that their fundamental purpose was to oppose the
worldwide spread of free trade and the lean government,
pro-business policies that promote it. But the conundrum for their
movement was that the new adversary _ globalism _ was faceless. It
was a product of commerce and technology more than of government or
guns. It was emerging everywhere at once, with no clear alternative
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   If the students were confronting anarchic change, they met it
with an anarchic movement. The strike steering committee took over
the campus, using barbed wire to keep other students out. They
elected no outstanding leaders and took their decisions in chaotic
all-night assemblies. Over the months the university conceded
demand after demand, but the strikers only upped the ante.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers confounded everyone who dealt with them, from
conciliatory university administrators to conservative
intellectuals to lifelong leftists. In the end, after the federal
police marched in on Feb. 6 and hauled the remaining strikers away
to jail, it seemed that the strike had been an end in itself, a
form of complete resistance against social and economic changes
they could never hope to control.
</P>
<P>
   The new leftism probably emerged in Mexico because this country
has led the charge in Latin America into the globalized age. Since
signing on to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico
has seen its international trade explode, its business middle class
rise like a phoenix and the country's northern half become an
industrial export powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the student strikers were also a product of globalization _
of two decades of policies that laid the foundations for Mexico's
recent leap into the global economy. The government has stimulated
growth by restraining inflation, mainly by depressing workers'
wages. Official figures show that the minimum wage today buys 48
percent of what it did in 1982. So, while export enclaves have
thrived, workers elsewhere have been drawn into a spiral of
downward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The national university, with 275,000 students, was once
Mexico's main avenue of social ascent. Today many students graduate
wondering if they will be able to earn a living. Alfonso Zarate, a
political analyst, said the strike revealed how much Mexico has
become ``a nation of winners and losers.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike was not radical at the start. It began last April, as
a protest against a plan to charge tuition _ about $150 a year _
for the first time in decades. The university president, Francisco
Barnes de Castro, cast the plan as an effort to get resources for a
critically underfunded institution. But in today's increasingly
impoverished urban working class, even small tuition costs can
break a family's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The new left gave the students a rationale for rejecting the
plan. It was a vast plot by the business-friendly government to
impose private sector logic on a public university, and deny
working class youth the education they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, a faction of strikers, dubbed ``ultras'' by their
companions because of their intolerance for dissent, gained the
upper hand through nasty purges. A central demand was for
face-to-face negotiations with the university president. But the
movement, once it was in the hands of the ultras, did not really
negotiate. The strikers never moved an inch from their original
demands. Administrators dropped the tuition plan, agreed to direct
talks, agreed even to hold a congress to reform how the whole
university was organized.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikers, true to their anarchist core and lacking
vision of an alternative, continued to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebellion is our only leader, our one true cause and the
reason for everything we do,'' read one banner.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Alvarez, an economics professor, at first supported
the strike but fell out with the ultras. ``They made distrust into
a form of politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the strike divided Mexico, which is in the midst of
a delicate move from authoritarianism to democracy. While the
general public applauded the police action to end the strike, many
intellectuals, journalists and democratic leaders saw it as an
extension of the bloody repression with which the student movement
of 1968 was broken. The result was some of the most vigorous street
protests Mexico has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to education and the division among Mexicans could
serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who thinks the changes that
globalization brings will only reinforce democratic institutions.

THE DEATH PENALTY: WHEN THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR

<P>
   When Gov. George Ryan of Illinois called last month for a
moratorium on executions in his state, he focused on the fact that
12 men on death row had recently been proven innocent. Sentencing
an innocent person to death was, the governor said, ``shameful,''
but he said little about how the legal representation these inmates
had received at trial may have contributed to justice gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune found, however, that 33 people who were
sentenced to die in Illinois had lawyers who were later disbarred
or suspended, and many more had lawyers with no experience in
capital cases. Death penalty experts say the situation is almost
certainly worse _ though not as well documented - in states where
capital punishment is more routine.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that in many capital cases the means to mount a
good defense, which often costs $250,000 or more, are lacking.
Elisabeth Semel, who runs an American Bar Association project
examining this question, describes the disparity in resources
available to the prosecution and the defense this way: ``It's like
a match between Mike Tyson and Martin Short, and the referee _ the
judge _ is on Tyson's payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, Connecticut and New York have attempted to address
these problems by creating a state funded central office of defense
lawyers who specialize in capital cases. David D. Wymore, chief
deputy public defender in Colorado, said: ``We found years ago that
we had to cultivate this expertise because capital law is very
complex and has all these traps. If you're inexperienced, you'll do
a poor job at trial and you'll fail to preserve your rights on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado is a Western state where the death penalty is popular,
yet prosecutors there seek the death penalty infrequently _ about
three times a year, on average _ in part, experts say, because they
believe that the Colorado Office of the Public Defender will defeat
all but the strongest cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Colorado office does an excellent job, and that greatly
reduces the chance of miscarriages of justice,'' said Stephen B.
Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta
and a professor at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous system for representing capital defendants not only
means fewer wrong verdicts, it also means fewer death sentences.
Experienced death penalty lawyers are adept at dissuading
prosecutors from seeking capital punishment, and juries from
applying it. In 52 capital trials in Colorado since 1975, five
people have been sentenced to death, and only one has been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason alone, few states will adopt this kind of
system,'' said Franklin E. Zimring, law professor and director of
the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``There is a great desire to have assembly-line
executions.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, like Colorado, has a capital defense team within
its public defender office, which is under contract to the state to
provide legal counsel to indigent defendants. As in most
Northeastern states, prosecutors seek the death penalty only
rarely. Still, in the 27 years since Connecticut reinstated capital
punishment, no one has been executed.
</P>
<P>
   New York's death penalty law, enacted in 1995, also created the
Capital Defender Office, rated by experts as the gold standard of
its kind. The office has a $15 million budget, provided by the
state. Its 21 trial lawyers and 17 investigators all receive
intensive training, and many have worked on capital cases in other
states. The Capital Defender Office joins a case as soon as a
defendant is charged with first-degree murder. Since 1995, there
have been 524 cases in which prosecutors either charged first
degree murder or went to court leaving open the possibility of that
charge. The Capital Defenders Office participated in the defense in
these cases as long as there was a possibility of a sentence of
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, prosecutors have sought the death penalty in 39
cases, winning it five times. The first execution is years away, as
all the cases are under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Doyle, New York's Capital Defender, says his office has
``a cultural advantage,'' in that New Yorkers are not as
enthusiastic about the death penalty as people in the South and
West. ``There's a moral ecology that says we're not just going to
pay lip service to constitutional rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are states like Texas, Alabama and Georgia, where the
death penalty is frequently imposed, and there is no public
defender system at all. Instead, judges appoint lawyepoor
defendants and set their compensation, often at low rates. Even
states like Illinois appoint lawyers this way when the caseload is
too large for the public defender offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a culture of habitually appointing courthouse
hangers-on,'' said David I. Bruck, a defense lawyer in South
Carolina who helps train lawyers in handling death penalty cases.
``They don't know capital law, they're cozy with the judges and
they're underpaid. It's not a good situation.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a photograph washed in sepia tones that lend
its scene _ the 1930 lynching of Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith and an
approving white mob _ an otherworldliness. Perhaps it was my father
who first showed it to me. Yet, growing up black in Kentucky, with
its not-so-distant past of lynching and other violent expressions
of racism, I knew that this picture depicted a hatred that was
embedded in my country. This lynching occurred in Marion, Ind., 24
years before I was born, but that gave me little comfort as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   I recently visited the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York City to
gaze again at that photograph, and 59 other images of lethal
brutality meted out to blacks by the vigilante's noose. For weeks,
thousands of visitors have crowded in for a glimpse of a dimly lit
chapter of American history.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, titled ``Witness,'' documents lynchings from
1883 through 1960 mostly with picture postcards from the collection
of James E. Allen and John Littlefield. Originally scheduled to
close Feb. 12, the show will move to larger quarters at the
New-York Historical Society in March.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Witness'' has dramatically renewed awareness of a
rite almost exclusively reserved for blacks, it only hints at why
lynching still haunts America's collective psyche. Although the
physical act has all but disappeared in this country, lynching
continues to be used as a stinging metaphor for profound injustice.
It represents, as Harlem-based author Albert Murray calls it,
``American terrorism'' at home.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At his troubled confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court,
Clarence Thomas effectively silenced his critics in the Senate,
accusing them of leading a ``high-tech lynching'' to derail his
nomination. The Ramsey family, white and wealthy, invoked the
L-word last fall to describe, perhaps too glibly, the unwanted
media attention since the unsolved murder of JonBenet Ramsey as a
``public lynching.'' Last December, when the New York City Board of
Education voted against extending Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's
contract, he stayed home because ``he prefers to be lynched in
absentia,'' his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lynch law, which owes its name to Charles Lynch, a Virginia
farmer who administered a rough justice to outlaws and Tories
during the Revolution, is a contradiction in a country grounded in
laws and rights. Unlike other outward spasms of racial, ethnic or
religious violence, the lynching of black people was not an
isolated incident to be blamed on an individual or a political
group. It was part of a culture in which those who upheld the law
looked the other way or, in many instances, participated.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of lynching brings Americans face to face with ``our
problematic history with due process and the rule of law,'' said
William Kornblum, sociologist at the City University of New York's
graduate school, ``Even today we can't face part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The faces of white men, women and children gathered at these
scenes express a certain satisfaction. What is more chilling is the
unmistakable air of celebration, evil posed as righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   And the white mobs did not stop at merely murdering their
victims. They often tortured and mutilated them, occasionally
burning them (``this is the barbecue we had last night,'' one
witness wrote). The victims, carrion left hanging from trees as a
warning, some castrated, were officially less than human. On the
other hand, the frontier hangings of white victims rarely included
castration or mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is one of atrocity,'' said Murray, who was born
near Mobile, Ala., in 1916. He cautioned blacks to be careful not
to get entangled in the act's accompanying messages of
powerlessness and victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up terrified of lynching,'' he said. ``I have no
scars from it that I know about. While I was growing up, I was
thinking about how to conquer the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Cameron, an 85-year-old writer and retired building
engineer in Milwaukee, Wis., disagrees. ``It is a part of history
that should be told,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron was almost part of the Horowitz exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   He, Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith, the two young men in that
photograph from my youth, were arrested for the robbery and murder
of a white man and the rape of a white woman in Marion. Whites
stormed the jail to lynch them. Cameron was beaten but released
when someone in the crowd vouched for his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that such a thing could happen,'' Cameron said.
``I was ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1882 to 1968, the Census Bureau counted the lynchings of
4,742 blacks. Historical references often include the victims'
alleged crimes, from rape to murder. But records also show blacks
hanged for little more than suspicion. In the act of lynching,
white women won respect, black men were emasculated and white men
made themselves omnipotent.
</P>
<P>
   The institution of lynching influenced men as dissimilar as
W.E.B. Du Bois, one of America's foremost equal rights activists,
and Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Sam Hose, a black farmer, killed a white man in an
argument over a debt. He was summarily hanged and then burned. Du
Bois, teaching at Atlanta University, was taking a letter of
protest to The Atlanta Constitution when he passed a downtown shop
window. In it was a trophy: the charred knuckles of Sam Hose. Du
Bois later helped found the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking with
the strategy of accommodation and demanding immediate rights for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in 1903, Elijah Muhammad was traumatized when a neatly
dressed white man approached him on the street, opened his palm and
showed him the ear of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   I knew these stories as a child. My father insisted that I
understand that such cruelties formed part of African-American
history. They were cautionary tales all too true, he would say.
</P>
<P>
   As I eagerly started out for my first newspaper job more than 20
years ago, I drove to a quiet and friendly town in northern
Indiana. Once settled in my apartment, I called a cousin who was
finishing college at an Indiana university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you tell me?'' I asked him about my new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said after a long pause, ``Marion is one of the
last places there was a public lynching of black folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a sudden confluence of memory and image. I drove to
the courthouse to remember how and where white justice was meted
out to two young black men and I wept. Most whites prefer to forget
lynching, seeing it as peculiar to another place and time. But most
blacks will continue to remember this ritual, in reality and
metaphor, until their own collective sense of vulnerability fades.

   The faces of white men, women and children gathered at these
scenes express a certain satisfaction. What is more chilling is the
unmistakable air of celebration, evil posed as righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   And the white mobs did not stop at merely murdering their
victims. They often tortured and mutilated them, occasionally
burning them (``this is the barbecue we had last night,'' one
witness wrote). The victims, carrion left hanging from trees as a
warning, some castrated, were officially less than human. On the
other hand, the frontier hangings of white victims rarely included
castration or mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is one of atrocity,'' said Murray, who was born
near Mobile, Ala., in 1916. He cautioned blacks to be careful not
to get entangled in the act's accompanying messages of
powerlessness and victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up terrified of lynching,'' he said. ``I have no
scars from it that I know about. While I was growing up, I was
thinking about how to conquer the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Cameron, an 85-year-old writer and retired building
engineer in Milwaukee, Wis., disagrees. ``It is a part of history
that should be told,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron was almost part of the Horowitz exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   He, Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith, the two young men in that
photograph from my youth, were arrested for the robbery and murder
of a white man and the rape of a white woman in Marion. Whites
stormed the jail to lynch them. Cameron was beaten but released
when someone in the crowd vouched for his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that such a thing could happen,'' Cameron said.
``I was ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1882 to 1968, the Census Bureau counted the lynchings of
4,742 blacks. Historical references often include the victims'
alleged crimes, from rape to murder. But records also show blacks
hanged for little more than suspicion. In the act of lynching,
white women won respect, black men were emasculated and white men
made themselves omnipotent.
</P>
<P>
   The institution of lynching influenced men as dissimilar as
W.E.B. Du Bois, one of America's foremost equal rights activists,
and Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Sam Hose, a black farmer, killed a white man in an
argument over a debt. He was summarily hanged and then burned. Du
Bois, teaching at Atlanta University, was taking a letter of
protest to The Atlanta Constitution when he passed a downtown shop
window. In it was a trophy: the charred knuckles of Sam Hose. Du
Bois later helped found the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking with
the strategy of accommodation and demanding immediate rights for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in 1903, Elijah Muhammad was traumatized when a neatly
dressed white man approached him on the street, opened his palm and
showed him the ear of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   I knew these stories as a child. My father insisted that I
understand that such cruelties formed part of African-American
history. They were cautionary tales all too true, he would say.
</P>
<P>
   As I eagerly started out for my first newspaper job more than 20
years ago, I drove to a quiet and friendly town in northern
Indiana. Once settled in my apartment, I called a cousin who was
finishing college at an Indiana university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you tell me?'' I asked him about my new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said after a long pause, ``Marion is one of the
last places there was a public lynching of black folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a sudden confluence of memory and image. I drove to
the courthouse to remember how and where white justice was meted
out to two young black men and I wept. Most whites prefer to forget
lynching, seeing it as peculiar to another place and time. But most
blacks will continue to remember this ritual, in reality and
metaphor, until their own collective sense of vulnerability fades.

INDONESIA'S PRESS: THE VICTOR IS A VICTIM IN LIBERTY'S TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the nearly two years since Indonesia's
strongman, Suharto, stepped down in May 1998, it is the press that
has been the most free, and the most tumultuous, of Indonesia's
institutions. It has been the fundamental underpinning for the
continuing move toward a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways today it is also a victim, not just a
protagonist, in the liberation _ and disorder _ it has helped
unleash.
</P>
<P>
   Its condition reveals a lot about the chaotic freedoms of the
new Indonesia, where the harsh hand of the dictator has often given
way to the unpredictable passions of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   In many arenas the rules that governed, and often stifled, the
nation have been eased or removed or simply ignored. As a result _
as in many newly liberated nations _ Indonesia's road from
repression to democracy is wild and uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the focus of change is on the military, with
President Abdurrahman Wahid returning Sunday from a foreign trip to
confront his most prominent general, Wiranto, who has so far
refused the president's demand to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The general, accused of human rights abuses, represents the old
guard that, under Suharto, saw itself as standard bearer and
enforcer of a top-down regime known for corruption, repression, and
the silencing of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Since Suharto's fall, the military has been retreating under the
pressure of a popular demand for civilian rule. But its new
weakness in the eyes of society comes with a social cost: It has
contributed to the uncertainties and instabilities the nation
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the present moment,'' said Susanto Pudjosumatono, chief
editor of the daily Jakarta Post, ``who cares about the law? Street
justice is the order of the day. Mobs deal with thieves and
burglars. Police are caught red-handed as burglars. Villagers loot
estates. Communal conflicts are flaring. People resort to violence
to settle disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the arena in which the press now operates.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of the fear of arrest or the closure of their newspapers,
editors no longer censor themselves to please authorities. But
self-censorship is alive among editors of newspapers both big and
small. It is the mob they fear.
</P>
<P>
   When Christian churches were burned on the island of Lombok
recently, one newspaper, sidestepping the religious conflict,
declined to identify them, calling them blandly ``houses of
worship.''
</P>
<P>
   When mobs demonstrated in the eastern Indonesian city of
Ujungpandang late last year, local editors said they refrained from
revealing the instigators for fear that the mobs would turn on them
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Javanese city of Solo, the most devastated city
in the huge riots of early 1998, armed thugs have threatened
reporters in their newsroom. Even in the capital, Jakarta, not long
ago, a mob protested outside the offices of Tempo, the nation's
leading magazine, vandalizing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Clear and professional reporting can be the most difficult in
the places where it is most needed, places like Ambon and Aceh
where separatist or communal conflicts threaten to touch off a
nationwide backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Bambang Harimukti, the editor of Tempo, said that to assure that
his reports are complete and unbiased he must consider sending in
non-local staff members who leave the area as soon as their
reporting is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the authorities wielding their power who are the
biggest threat anymore,'' Susanto said. ``Now the clear and present
danger comes from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In this unstable arena, the press has played a crucial role in
keeping the country's political and social evolution more or less
on course. As an independent institution, its reforms came quickly,
leading the way into a new atmosphere of openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the changes we've seen, the press is perhaps
Indonesia's most transformed institution,'' said Warief Djajanto,
an executive at the Indonesian news agency, Antara.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 18 months after Suharto stepped down, 1,500 press
licenses were issued by the liberal-minded new minister of
information, Yunus Yosfiah.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under a new press law passed last fall, the requirement
for licenses was abolished. Nobody knows now how many newspapers
and radio stations have joined the babble around the nation, but
they have contributed to a brand new sense that anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the newspapers offer serious political reporting and
analysis, investigations of corruption and military abuses,
high-stakes policy debates and fundamental explorations of new
directions for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many new outlets, the country suffers from a
crippling shortage of trained journalists and much of what is
printed and aired lacks fundamental elements of accuracy and
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   With so few resources, some small newspapers do not even pay
their reporters. They simply issue them press cards and leave them
to seek whatever fees and payoffs they can earn from their sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we organize training for young reporters, many lack
professionalism both in journalistic competence and in ethical
competence,'' Susanto said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono, in a recent interview,
complained of widespread tabloid journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a vigorous press but it is often a vigorous and
irresponsible press,'' he said. ``A lot of hopes have been placed
in the press but I don't think these hopes have been fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those hopes were too high at this early stage. Without
the free press, flawed as it is, Indonesia might have made far less
progress than it has.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto was president, just about every institution in
Indonesia had one thing in common: from the courts to the
bureaucracy to the military to the press, they were tailored to
serve his interests.
</P>
<P>
   When he departed, he left intact a venal and self-serving
legislature, a power-hungry military and a thoroughgoing culture of
corruption that, without the pressure of an overwhelming popular
will, might well have reverted to their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   They never had a chance. Suddenly, political talk shows filled
the airwaves, an unfiltered puree of wisdom and nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But at their heart was a powerful momentum for change.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pity the poor presidential campaign strategists.
With make-or-break primaries fast approaching, they're frantically
trying to cobble together winning strategies to appeal to an
electorate so diverse, cacophonous and in flux as to make the folks
trying to build the Tower of Babel sound like a harmonious glee
club. With no big issue like war, recession or incumbency to give
the 2000 race some shape, America looks more than ever like an
indistinct montage of contending groups _ some new, some old
standbys.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there are hero-admiring dads to take into
consideration along with angry white males, single moms along with
soccer moms. There are seniors whose politics are shifting ever
rightward and _ perhaps most important _ a growing number of
independents who, as their name suggests, are hardly a monolith.
Cutting across everything is a schizophrenic view of President
Clinton, who is both loved and loathed at the same time _ sometimes
by the same people.
</P>
<P>
   It's a niche marketer's dream, and a pundit's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on out there,'' said David Axelrod, a
Democratic political consultant in Chicago. ``There is no one thing
that was driving everything as there was in '92 or '80 or '84.
There are times when single issues overwhelm everything else. This
isn't one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the key electoral demographics is a tricky
business, but here goes anyway:
</P>
<P>
   THE GUY'S GUY. In some ways, the last few years have been tough
for white guys. Sure, they're making money, either through overtime
at the auto plant or overdrive in the stock market. They've got
SUVs and IPOs. But in the political arena, they've had nobody to
look up to. Four years ago, the thought of a Colin Powell candidacy
made many weak in the knees. But he took a hike on them. Now
they've suddenly got two straight-talking heroes _ John McCain and
Bill Bradley _ from the realms of war and sport.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the Los Angeles Times during the New
Hampshire primary illustrate what could be the makings of a gender
gap involving both McCain and Bradley. According to the polls, 50
percent of men voting in the Republican primary backed McCain while
only 29 percent went for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among men
voting Democratic, Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore among men by
about four points (while he trailed Gore by five points among
women).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all those guilty male boomers who didn't go to Nam,'' Lou
DiNatali, a senior fellow with the John W. McCormack Institute, a
Boston-based research organization, said of McCain's appeal to men.
``First, they went with Clinton, the anti-war guy. Now they go for
the POW.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gender gap has helped McCain more than Bradley.
That's because so many more men vote in Republican primaries than
in Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain win the Republican nomination, his male-based
appeal will probably widen the already cavernous gender gap between
the Republicans and Democrats, since Gore draws much of his
strength from women. That situation might favor the Democrat, since
there were 7 million more eligible female voters than eligible male
voters in 1998. And women tend to register and vote in higher
proportions than men.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENTS' DAY. In the New Hampshire primary, unaffiliated
voters helped power McCain to a 19-point victory over Bush, and
kept Bradley close enough to Gore to remain in the race. The
independents' role there has stirred interest in how much of a
force they will be in other primaries and the general election.
After all, they make up about 13 percent of the electorate
nationally, 25 percent in the Rocky Mountain states and 34 percent
of registered voters in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But the independents are hardly a bloc. There are so-called
``prosperity independents,'' affluent, generally white,
college-educated, Internet-savvy, stock-buying voters who tend to
be pro-environment and socially liberal yet fiscally conservative.
They were a hefty slice of McCain's support in New Hampshire, but
in national polls they also tend to like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also roped in his share of independents in New Hampshire
as well. But his independents, while also well educated, tended to
be less affluent, earning less than $50,000 annually, according to
polls conducted by RKM Researchers Inc. of Portsmouth, N.H. These
voters tend to be more liberal when it comes to government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third large group of independents: people who aren't
particularly interested in politics. More than 7.1 million people
were added to the voter rolls in 1997 and 1998, as a result of the
so-called ``motor voter'' law, which made it possible to register
to vote when renewing a driver's license, applying for welfare and
conducting business with other government agencies. Many of these
new voters have registered as independents. Who these disaffected
voters will vote for _ if they vote at all _ is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   BIFURCATED BLACKS. The black vote, as always, will be critical
for Democrats. But while 55 percent of blacks live in the South,
they tend to turn out in lower proportions than Northern blacks,
who tend to be more affluent and better educated and are less
likely to live in hard-to-organize rural areas. Indeed, except for
1992, Northern blacks have voted in higher proportions than
Southern blacks in every presidential election since the Voting
Rights Act was passed in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Some political strategists say that unless this changes, the
black vote may be more of a factor in closely fought states in the
industrial Midwest like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio than in Deep
South states like Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, where
Republicans have had a lock.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIANT SLEEPS TONIGHT. For years, Hispanics have been
described as the sleeping giant of U.S. politics, and George W.
Bush has trumpeted the fact that he can appeal to this group. Yet
when it comes to presidential races, there are no signs this giant
is stirring or that Hispanics will have much of an impact on the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up about 10 percent of the voting age population.
But half of that group is concentrated in two states _ California
and Texas. In 1996, Bill Clinton got 71 percent of the Hispanic
vote in California and won the state. He got 76 percent of that
vote in Texas and lost. Most strategists do not expect a markedly
different result this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-VOTING-GROUPS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: this year. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides, about 40 percent of Hispanics of voting age are not
U.S. citizens, and only 26 percent of those eligible to vote did so
in 1996 _ far fewer than non-Hispanic whites and blacks _ despite a
major effort by the Democratic Party and Hispanic leaders to get
out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The one state where Hispanics may be crucial is Florida. Four
years ago, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, won only
46 percent of the Hispanics who voted there, mainly conservative
Cuban-Americans. That was the lowest draw of any Republican
candidate in recent memory. Vowing not to let that happen again,
the Republicans _ particularly Bush, whose brother, Jeb, is the
governor _ are vigorously courting Cuban-American voters. But
Democrats, noting that the Cuban-American community is younger and
less vehemently anti-Castro, sense an opening.
</P>
<P>
   OLD STORY. It used to be that the band would strike up the
Roosevelt-era anthem ``Happy Days Are Here Again'' and elderly
voters would feel all nostalgic and troop off to vote Democratic.
No more. Quite simply, many of those seniors who remember the New
Deal have passed away, and many more of the voters now over 65 are
people who were swept up in the Reagan Revolution and have remained
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior vote today is a different group of people than it
was four years ago and eight years ago,'' said John Rother,
director of legislation and public policy for the American
Association of Retired Persons, who is not publicly supporting any
candidate. ``They didn't go through a life experience like the
Depression that brought everybody together and they don't have the
same view of government.''
</P>
<P>
   THE YOUNG AND THE LISTLESS. Despite efforts like MTV's ``Rock
the Vote,'' young people continue to be among the most politically
apathetic groups in the country. In 1996, only 32.4 percent of
people 18 to 24 years old cast a ballot _ the lowest level since
1972, when the voting age was lowered to 18.
</P>
<P>
   A close race and a maverick candidate like Bradley or McCain
might bring out more young voters. But it's unclear if anything can
break through this group's lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   STILL ANGRY AFTER ALL. The angry white males are still around.
They tend to be college grads, relatively affluent and over 50
years old. They are more likely married, living in the South and
are often ex-Democrats turned Republican. They hate Clinton with a
passion. According to Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center for
People and the Press, they make up about 10 percent of the
population and 12 percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   They had a moment in the sun in 1994, when they helped power the
Republicans to control of Congress. But even as their economic
status has improved and their influence has waned, their anger has
not diminished. ``Many still feel that the cultural winds are
blowing against them,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in
Atlanta. ``That creates the sense that the forces of political
correctness are working against them and what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   I DO, I DO. The gender gap has been a hardy perennial in
analyses of the electorate. But perhaps as important in determining
who is wed to which party is a voter's marital status. Exit polls
indicate that married men supported the Republican over the
Democrat in every presidential race since 1984, and that except for
1996, when they backed Clinton over Bob Dole, married women did the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarried men have a more checkered recent history, backing
Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George Bush in 1988, and flocking to
Clinton in 1992 and 1996. On the other hand, Democrats since 1984
have set single women's hearts aflutter. And in Kohut's survey,
60.7 percent of unmarried women with children _ so-called waitress
moms _ said they supported Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about soccer moms, but, really, for Clinton and
Gore, it's single moms,'' Kohut said.

   WASHINGTON _ Pity the poor presidential campaign strategists.
With make-or-break primaries fast approaching, they're frantically
trying to cobble together winning strategies to appeal to an
electorate so diverse, cacophonous and in flux as to make the folks
trying to build the Tower of Babel sound like a harmonious glee
club. With no big issue like war, recession or incumbency to give
the 2000 race some America looks more than ever like an
indistinct montage of contending groups _ some new, some old
standbys.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there are hero-admiring dads to take into
consideration along with angry white males, single moms along with
soccer moms. There are seniors whose politics are shifting ever
rightward and _ perhaps most important _ a growing number of
independents who, as their name suggests, are hardly a monolith.
Cutting across everything is a schizophrenic view of President
Clinton, who is both loved and loathed at the same time _ sometimes
by the same people.
</P>
<P>
   It's a niche marketer's dream, and a pundit's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on out there,'' said David Axelrod, a
Democratic political consultant in Chicago. ``There is no one thing
that was driving everything as there was in '92 or '80 or '84.
There are times when single issues overwhelm everything else. This
isn't one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the key electoral demographics is a tricky
business, but here goes anyway:
</P>
<P>
   THE GUY'S GUY. In some ways, the last few years have been tough
for white guys. Sure, they're making money, either through overtime
at the auto plant or overdrive in the stock market. They've got
SUVs and IPOs. But in the political arena, they've had nobody to
look up to. Four years ago, the thought of a Colin Powell candidacy
made many weak in the knees. But he took a hike on them. Now
they've suddenly got two straight-talking heroes _ John McCain and
Bill Bradley _ from the realms of war and sport.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the Los Angeles Times during the New
Hampshire primary illustrate what could be the makings of a gender
gap involving both McCain and Bradley. According to the polls, 50
percent of men voting in the Republican primary backed McCain while
only 29 percent went for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among men
voting Democratic, Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore among men by
about four points (while he trailed Gore by five points among
women).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all those guilty male boomers who didn't go to Nam,'' Lou
DiNatali, a senior fellow with the John W. McCormack Institute, a
Boston-based research organization, said of McCain's appeal to men.
``First, they went with Clinton, the anti-war guy. Now they go for
the POW.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gender gap has helped McCain more than Bradley.
That's because so many more men vote in Republican primaries than
in Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain win the Republican nomination, his male-based
appeal will probably widen the already cavernous gender gap between
the Republicans and Democrats, since Gore draws much of his
strength from women. That situation might favor the Democrat, since
there were 7 million more eligible female voters than eligible male
voters in 1998. And women tend to register and vote in higher
proportions than men.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENTS' DAY. In the New Hampshire primary, unaffiliated
voters helped power McCain to a 19-point victory over Bush, and
kept Bradley close enough to Gore to remain in the race. The
independents' role there has stirred interest in how much of a
force they will be in other primaries and the general election.
After all, they make up about 13 percent of the electorate
nationally, 25 percent in the Rocky Mountain states and 34 percent
of registered voters in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But the independents are hardly a bloc. There are so-called
``prosperity independents,'' affluent, generally white,
college-educated, Internet-savvy, stock-buying voters who tend to
be pro-environment and socially liberal yet fiscally conservative.
They were a hefty slice of McCain's support in New Hampshire, but
in national polls they also tend to like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also roped in his share of independents in New Hampshire
as well. But his independents, while also well educated, tended to
be less affluent, earning less than $50,000 annually, according to
polls conducted by RKM Researchers Inc. of Portsmouth, N.H. These
voters tend to be more liberal when it comes to government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third large group of independents: people who aren't
particularly interested in politics. More than 7.1 million people
were added to the voter rolls in 1997 and 1998, as a result of the
so-called ``motor voter'' law, which made it possible to register
to vote when renewing a driver's license, applying for welfare and
conducting business with other government agencies. Many of these
new voters have registered as independents. Who these disaffected
voters will vote for _ if they vote at all _ is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   BIFURCATED BLACKS. The black vote, as always, will be critical
for Democrats. But while 55 percent of blacks live in the South,
they tend to turn out in lower proportions than Northern blacks,
who tend to be more affluent and better educated and are less
likely to live in hard-to-organize rural areas. Indeed, except for
1992, Northern blacks have voted in higher proportions than
Southern blacks in every presidential election since the Voting
Rights Act was passed in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Some political strategists say that unless this changes, the
black vote may be more of a factor in closely fought states in the
industrial Midwest like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio than in Deep
South states like Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, where
Republicans have had a lock.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIANT SLEEPS TONIGHT. For years, Hispanics have been
described as the sleeping giant of U.S. politics, and George W.
Bush has trumpeted the fact that he can appeal to this group. Yet
when it comes to presidential races, there are no signs this giant
is stirring or that Hispanics will have much of an impact on the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up about 10 percent of the voting age population.
But half of that group is concentrated in two states _ California
and Texas. In 1996, Bill Clinton got 71 percent of the Hispanic
vote in California and won the state. He got 76 percent of that
vote in Texas and lost. Most strategists do not expect a markedly
different result this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-VOTING-GROUPS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: this year. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides, about 40 percent of Hispanics of voting age are not
U.S. citizens, and only 26 percent of those eligible to vote did so
in 1996 _ far fewer than non-Hispanic whites and blacks _ despite a
major effort by the Democratic Party and Hispanic leaders to get
out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The one state where Hispanics may be crucial is Florida. Four
years ago, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, won only
46 percent of the Hispanics who voted there, mainly conservative
Cuban-Americans. That was the lowest draw of any Republican
candidate in recent memory. Vowing not to let that happen again,
the Republicans _ particularly Bush, whose brother, Jeb, is the
governor _ are vigorously courting Cuban-American voters. But
Democrats, noting that the Cuban-American community is younger and
less vehemently anti-Castro, sense an opening.
</P>
<P>
   OLD STORY. It used to be that the band would strike up the
Roosevelt-era anthem ``Happy Days Are Here Again'' and elderly
voters would feel all nostalgic and troop off to vote Democratic.
No more. Quite simply, many of those seniors who remember the New
Deal have passed away, and many more of the voters now over 65 are
people who were swept up in the Reagan Revolution and have remained
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior vote today is a different group of people than it
was four years ago and eight years ago,'' said John Rother,
director of legislation and public policy for the American
Association of Retired Persons, who is not publicly supporting any
candidate. ``They didn't go through a life experience like the
Depression that brought everybody together and they don't have the
same view of government.''
</P>
<P>
   THE YOUNG AND THE LISTLESS. Despite efforts like MTV's ``Rock
the Vote,'' young people continue to be among the most politically
apathetic groups in the country. In 1996, only 32.4 percent of
people 18 to 24 years old cast a ballot _ the lowest level since
1972, when the voting age was lowered to 18.
</P>
<P>
   A close race and a maverick candidate like Bradley or McCain
might bring out more young voters. But it's unclear if anything can
break through this group's lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   STILL ANGRY AFTER ALL. The angry white males are still around.
They tend to be college grads, relatively affluent and over 50
years old. They are more likely married, living in the South and
are often ex-Democrats turned Republican. They hate Clinton with a
passion. According to Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center for
People and the Press, they make up about 10 percent of the
population and 12 percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   They had a moment in the sun in 1994, when they helped power the
Republicans to control of Congress. But even as their economic
status has improved and their influence has waned, their anger has
not diminished. ``Many still feel that the cultural winds are
blowing against them,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in
Atlanta. ``That creates the sense that the forces of political
correctness are working against them and what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   I DO, I DO. The gender gap has been a hardy perennial in

MISSION STATEMENTS: WORDS THAT CAN'T BE SET TO MUSIC

   Mission statements _ those distilled essences of corporate goals
_ will never be confused with works of Donne or Shakespeare. Yet
they have caught on like Britney Spears' latest hit, becoming
poetry to executives' ears, sonnets to shareholder value, so much
so that 86 percent of U.S. corporations have their own carefully
worded, neatly printed, widely disseminated statements.
</P>
<P>
   While this mass embrace of codified corporate goals seems part
hula hoop fad, part keeping up with the Joneses, many business
executives say they serve as a vital compass. Also called credos or
vision statements, they range from florid language to business
school argot, from snappy staccato to
I-need-No-Doz-to-finish-reading-this-thing.
</P>
<P>
   In its credo, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the pharmaceutical giant, says,
``Our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients,
to the mothers and all others who use our products.'' BankAmerica
boasts of its dedication to ``unselfish banking,'' while Celestial
Seasonings pledges to sell ``the best-tasting, 100 percent natural
hot and iced teas, packaged with Celestial art and philosophy,
creating the most valued tea experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Many executives hail their statements as magic potions that help
inspire corporate turnarounds. But others acknowledge that such
documents fall flat and end up forgotten just months after
corporate leaders trumpeted the statements, which were often
developed during lengthy retreats with high-priced consultants.
</P>
<P>
   When Christopher K. Bart, a business school professor at
McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, surveyed 88 corporations
about their statements, he came up with surprising results. For
some companies, the documents are the ``sex drive'' or ``libido''
of organizational life and inspire high performance and passion
toward the organization. But at other companies, they were an
assemblage of trite phrases that impress neither senior managers
nor low-level employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall conclusion is that, in any sample of mission
statements, the vast majority are not worth the paper that they are
written on and should not be taken with any degree of
seriousness,'' Bart said.
</P>
<P>
   This description could have been borrowed from a game, called
Mission Statement Generator, at the www.dilbertzone.com Website,
inspired by the I-don't-buy-the-company-line comic strip. This
Mission Statement Generator offers 17 interchangeable adverbs, 26
interchangeable verbs and 39 interchangeable adverbs that produce
bureaucratic gems like, ``It's our responsibility to
synergistically supply virtual leadership skills as well as to
continually build prospective paradigms for 100 percent customer
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements are no laughing matter to supporters. ``It's the
glue that holds this corporation together,'' said Michael J. Carey,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson's vice president for organizational planning and
development. ``The message is the ability to produce business
results, not at any cost, but within our value system.'' Johnson &AMP;
Johnson's credo, which dates from 1943, calls for maintaining
reasonable prices, paying employees adequately, being good citizens
and even bearing ``our fair share of taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Moore, the bane of Corporate America and author of
``Downsize This!'' (Crown, 1996), mocked credos that call employees
``team members'' as attempts at brainwashing. In an era when
corporations lay off thousands of workers at a time, he faulted
these statements for making believe that management's and labor's
interests were one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   Mission statements, which were far less prevalent in the 1970s,
became ubiquitous management tools after President Jimmy Carter
urged companies to adopt tougher ethical standards and after the
1982 best seller, ``In Pursuit of Excellence'' advised companies to
articulate clear goals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Johnson &AMP; Johnson's credo guided them through one
of its worst crises: the 1982 incident in which cyanide placed in a
bottle of Tylenol killed a consumer. The company recalled every
bottle at the cost of $75 million. After seeing the cookie-cutter
approach of many companies, Harvey Mackay, chairman of Mackay
Envelope Corp. in Minneapolis, adopted a statement that has raised
a lot of eyebrows: ``To be in business forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at a lot of these mission statements,'' he said,
``they are a total, unequivocal blur.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on staying in business forever tells employees to
focus on the long term, MacKay said, and not to push too hard a
bargain with customers or suppliers because customers might go to
other companies and suppliers might give the best new technologies
to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that some short statements, like the Marines' ``Semper
Fi,'' work splendidly, Mackay settled for brevity. ``I like to
shock people,'' he said. ``And this one just clicked.''

   Welcome to the ivory tower in the dot.com age, where commerce
and competition have set up shop.
</P>

   Several years ago, educators and entrepreneurs began to see that
millions of students and potential students might be reached, and
tens of millions of dollars earned, using the Internet to provide a
higher education. More than one-third of all colleges and
universities in the United States already offer distance learning,
as it is called; by 2002, four of every five are expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, now recognizes that the 14 million or so
students engaged in some form of higher education make up only a
small part of a much larger market.
</P>
<P>
   What if part-time students working toward a degree after work,
Chinese executives interested in Western management techniques,
European farmers studying advanced agronomy and American retirees
with the time to retake a favorite but forgotten Shakespeare course
_ paying customers all _ were just a modem away from class?
</P>
<P>
   It was and is an alluring prospect, but one thing the
universities didn't envision was how their professors would react
to it. Distance learning sells the knowledge inside a professor's
head directly to a global online audience. That means that, just by
doing what he does every day, a teacher potentially could grow rich
instructing a class consisting of a million students signed up by
the Internet-based educational firm that marketed the course and
handles the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faculty are dreaming of returns that are probably multiples of
their lifetime net worth,'' said Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard
Business School. ``They are doing things like saying, `This
technology allows someone who is used to teaching 100 students to
teach a million students.' And they are running numbers and
imagining, `Gee, what if everyone paid $10 to listen to my
lecture?'''
</P>
<P>
   Academics and their academies are already squaring off over who
owns the electronic rights to a professor's lectures and research.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable collision so far, as chronicled in The Wall
Street Journal in November, involved Arthur Miller, a celebrated
Harvard Law School professor and a pioneer legal analyst on
television. Miller says Harvard never objected to his work on
``Good Morning America'' or elsewhere, but he was rebuked by his
deans for videotaping a 10-hour lecture series last summer for
Concord, an online law school founded by Kaplan, the well-known
student preparatory company. Why the sudden change of heart? ``I
don't think it's undue cynicism to recognize that many of the
old-format educational productions _ books, monographs, articles _
produce no or very little revenue,'' Miller said in an interview.
``They were of no concern to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Today they are of great concern, and Harvard is rewriting its
policies on how professors may use course materials. So are a great
many other schools, large and small. But in doing so they are
exploring relatively uncharted legal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the general rule was that a professor was free to
write textbooks, even if based on his course work, and to keep all
royalties. Patented research conducted on campus was a different
matter, subject to various restrictions to which professors
typically had to agree as a condition of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The old contract no longer applies partly because of the number
of new outlets for academic expertise created by the Internet _
which can distribute material as text, sound, moving image or a
combination of the three. But powering the commercial growth of
this new technology are the huge sums of money the Internet has
attracted to distance education.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rosenfield, for example, is the chief executive of
Unext.com, a startup that plans to offer a full range of college
courses over the Internet. Rosenfield estimates his company will
spend nearly $100 million developing courses before it receives $1
of tuition. Unext is backed by Michael Milken, the former junk-bond
king, who was convicted of securities law violations in 1990. The
company has signed deals with Columbia, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon
University, and the University of Chicago, promising them revenue
from the course materials they develop, and granting them Unext
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Unext envisions a world where anyone can begin a course in, say,
basic finance, at any time of the year, from any location. Indeed,
to make a profit, the company will need to have thousands of people
engaged in a particular course at a time, Rosenfield said. But he
believes that the opportunity to take courses designed by elite
schools will attract such numbers. Company projections suggest
that, if he is correct, the University of Chicago could earn $20
million in royalties alone from the venture over the next five
years. (Payment to participating professors has not yet been set.)
No wonder, then, that Chicago's scholars must now seek the
university's permission before they engage in similar efforts on
their own.

   Williams College, the prestigious liberal arts college in
western Massachusetts, is reviewing another corporate offer. Global
Education Network, a company founded partly by Herb Allen, the
president of the venture-capital firm Allen &AMP; Co., has approached
Williams and Brown University, among others, with an invitation to
contribute course material to a proposed for-profit Web site
providing on line liberal arts education for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Williams have said that the venture could earn the
institution upwards of $250,000 per year, per course, for up to 10
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General, which owns Harcourt Brace, a major textbook
publishing company, is yet another firm entering the field.
Harcourt announced last summer that it would create an independent,
full-range, distance learning ``university,'' offering college
degrees in a variety of disciplines. And this spring, Kaplan will
introduce KaplanCollege.com, which will offer degree and
certificate programs in a number of fields including education,
real estate, financial services, paralegal studies and nursing, in
addition to law.
</P>
<P>
   Obscured by all this entrepreneurial activity lies a still more
fundamental issue: As distance learning enterprises start competing
with colleges and universities for students, tuition and faculty,
will they not also progressively marginalize ``brick and mortar''
institutions, perhaps even rendering them obsolete?
</P>
<P>
   Elite institutions like Williams are the ones least likely to be
displaced by technological innovation. But there are some 3,500
colleges and universities in the United States alone, and distance
education will certainly make a portion of them redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that really are going to get hurt by distance
learning are the smaller, independent institutions located in rural
areas,'' said James V. Koch, president of Old Dominion University,
in Virginia. Those schools generally charge high tuition, and
students will find it cheaper to take distance learning courses for
at least part of their degree program.
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning will also provide a simple credentialing
function _ certifying that someone has acquired a certain skill,
say, in computer programming or accounting, entirely bypassing
traditional institutions of higher learning and trade schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are going to be loads and loads of students who
want the traditional experience _ the football team and the junior
year abroad,'' Koch said. But will that traditional experience be
recognizable if colleges and universities begin behaving like
corporate profit centers?
</P>
<P>
   The advent of distance learning has turned everyone, from
trumpet teachers to professors of Japanese and statistics, into
potential entrepreneurs. And like relatives sharing a winning
lottery ticket, professors and their schools are elbowing each
other in pursuit of the same pot of gold. ``This set of
technologies, and the opportunities it presents, create potential
conflicts of commitment _ of the faculty's commitment to the
university, and of the university's commitment to the faculty and
to its core mission,'' said Clark of Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the institutions and the faculty don't reaffirm those
commitments,'' he added, ``the forces will actually tear places
apart.''

`PEANUTS' CARTOONIST A GENTLE MESSENGER TO THE END

   Good ol' Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Like Charlie Brown, the moon-faced and ill-fated cartoon
character he created half a century ago, Charles Monroe Schulz
persevered. When he died of a heart attack in his sleep on Saturday
night at the age of 77, it was just hours before Charlie and the
rest of the ``Peanuts'' crowd made their final original appearance
in print. It was as if Mr. Schulz, who was suffering from colon
cancer and had announced the retirement of both the comic strip and
himself in December, was waiting for Charlie, Linus, Schroeder, Pig
Pen, and Snoopy to depart so he could go with them.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when pop icons change with the click of a remote
control or a mouse, Mr. Schulz and ``Peanuts'' endured. One of the
major blessings of the strip _ the most widely read in history _
was that it didn't change to fit the times. Charlie Brown always
reacted to his misfortunes with a low-key ``Good grief!'' (Can you
imagine him saying ``Bummer?'' Please.) Lucy was seldom nice, even
when she was charging a nickel for advice. (Can you imagine her fee
being affected by inflation? Not likely.) Snoopy never upgraded his
aircraft from World War I vintage to supersonic jet. (Can you
imagine him traveling at the speed of sound? Not at all.)
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, no one could ever imagine Lucy actually leaving
the football on the ground and letting poor, hapless Charlie Brown
kick it. Not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schulz's contract reportedly ensures that no one else will
draw ``Peanuts.'' Good thing. He was, by all accounts, a true
gentleman who was able to imbue his characters with gentle souls
despite their anxiety, angst, and frustration. ``AACK! I can't
stand it!'' Charlie Brown would gripe, but it wasn't his style to
haul off and slug someone. Maybe that's why we haven't seen a
``Peanuts'' video game.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained early in Mr. Schulz's career that his
artistic style was too primitive, and he subsequently altered it
somewhat. Later he was chastised for the simplicity of ``Peanuts''
itself, something he didn't change. Good for him. After all, he
wove together a tapestry of psychology, philosophy, and theology
that was as rich as anything the comics field has ever seen.
Anybody who thought that ``Peanuts'' was about a boy falling down
while trying to kick a football was missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schulz arrived on the scene at a time when superheroes were
the comic rage, and he created a bunch of pre-adolescent
anti-heroes. But although ``Peanuts'' was supposedly about a gaggle
of kids, we knew better than that, even though there were no adults
in the strip. We knew that ``Peanuts'' was also about us grown-ups
who grew up after World War II and spent an inordinate amount of
time fretting about our insecurities. (Mr. Schulz may not have
invented the term ``security blanket,'' but he certainly
popularized it.) Like us, Charlie Brown struggled mightly just to
get through the day. He was Everyman, not Everyboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create humor out of happiness,'' Mr. Schulz once
wrote, adding: ``I'm astonished at the number of people who write
to me saying, `Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does
Charlie Brown always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the
football?' Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets
to kick the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mr. Schulz was no pessimist. Charlie Brown may have
struggled, but he never gave up. He was truly an American hero _ or
at least the kind of hero Americans admire _ repeatedly pulling
himself off the canvas after getting whacked around by the pitfalls
of life. ``You've just got to let things go along, ride them out,
and see how they turn out in the end,'' Mr. Schulz explained once.
``There's no use trying to solve all your problems in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schulz often compared himself to Charlie Brown, describing
himself as someone who tries to do the right thing but for whom
things often go wrong. And although his biographer, Rheta Grimsley
Johnson, wrote that he grappled with depression and anxiety, he was
an indefatigably decent person whose kindness and modesty were
unaltered by his success and the millions of dollars it fetched.
The cartoonist was known as ``Sparky,'' treated his fans with
outmost respect, and took only one vacation in his professional
life.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, Jeannie, and five children from
his first marriage. A private funeral is scheduled for this week.
</P>
<P>
   There's always been a tendency to do Mr. Schulz by the numbers:
2,600 newspapers in 76 countries, more than 1,400 books, some 40
animated television specials, 355 million readers. But that's not
the point.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schulz created a comic strip that did what it was
supposed to do: It was funny. Alas, that's not as common as it
sounds, and Mr. Schulz knew it. In an interview about five years
ago, he lamented the ``rollicking sense of humor that we don't
have'' in our comics and other media.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he had it, and so did the entire ``Peanuts'' crew. We
thought Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz would go on forever, and
now we've lost both in the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief is right.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Haiti a bad scene gone worse
 &HT;    (For release Feb. 16, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before a chilled, rain-soggy South Carolina picnic audience last
weekend, Republican presidential contender John McCain played his
military hand. He called for greater benefits for our veterans,
taking precise note that the veterans of World War II _ ``the last
great generation,'' he quoted Tom Brokaw's book _ were dying out
and were entitled to better treatment from our government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, staying on a military theme, he targeted the Clinton
administration's foreign policies, where it is quite vulnerable.
McCain wanted to know what has changed in Haiti since we sent
20,000 troops there in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   (Along the way, the Vietnam war hero slipped into a bit of
demagoguery when he commented that the current president, secretary
of defense and secretary of state have never worn a military
uniform. Neither did Franklin D. Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson or
Abraham Lincoln; so what?)
</P>
<P>
   It has been 5 1/2 years since Clinton sent troops into Haiti to
oust an unelected ruler and to relieve the chaos that was Haitian
politics, human rights and economy.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain rightly asks, what has changed?
</P>
<P>
   Presently, Haiti does not have a legislative body, it being
dissolved more than a year ago by President Rene Preval. Elections
to restore a parliament are scheduled for March and April, thus
prompting more chaos. Voter registrations have been hampered by the
inability of mny registration offices to even open their doors. In
some areas, political thuggery has returned.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's economy does not exist. Its forest lands stripped by
residents, its factories impeded by a lack of production and
acceptance in a global market, Haiti remains decades if not
centuries behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the last U.S. soldier left Haiti, taking with him
15,000 pounds of equipment. True, a U.N. mission remains there, but
someone tell me about a successful U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Haiti today? One need look no further than the Central
Intelligence Agency World Factbook for that answer: ``About 75
percent of the population lives in abject poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few, the times are good. Those are the ones who have gone
into the export business _ exporting drugs. The CIA World Factbook
says Haiti is a transshipment point for cocaine and marijuana en
route to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That is most evidenced by recent discoveries that small Haitian
freighters coming to South Florida are bringing in tons of illegal
drugs, squirreled into hard-to-find locations in the ships' hulls.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's other chief export is refugees. Desperate for economic
opportunities, Haitians regularly make the difficult voyage to
Florida, only to be interdicted by the U.S. Coast Guard and
immediately repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   So, back to McCain's criticism: What has been accomplished by
sending 20,000 American troops to Haiti in 1994? Could the money
spent on that and on their maintenance since then have been better
used to help Haiti with its economy, its agriculture, its
educational facilities?
</P>
<P>
   One only can imagine how much is being spent annually by the
U.S. to fight the drug traffic from Haiti and to patrol the seas
interdicting and returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti, with an unemployment rate of 60 percent, a life
expectancy average of but 51.6 years, an illiteracy rate of 55
percent and a birth rate of 32.5 births per 1,000 population, is a
pathetic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the answer to world matters is not easily solved by
the use of military troops. It didn't work in Haiti or Somalia, it
is not working in Kosovo, and even Grenada, which Ronald Reagan
supposedly saved from the clutches of Fidel Castro, is back
sleeping with the Cuban dictator.
</P>
<P>
   If there really is a Third World, then Haiti is in a Fourth

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Watch Austria carefully but don't overreact
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, we're all on record as thinking it thoroughly appalling and
a bit scary that the minority party in Austria's new governing
coalition is a right-wing hard case led by a man who is the next
thing to a neo-Nazi and maybe even the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   With the point made, we'd probably do best now to wait, before
making any more moves against Austria, to see if the resulting
government in fact misbehaves intolerably.
</P>
<P>
   European Union countries have, variously, downgraded their
diplomatic missions, canceled trade plans and pulled out of
international conferences in Austria to protest the decision of the
right-center People's Party to partner with the Freedom Party led
by the noxious Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Haider himself is not in the government, but he has parlayed his
party's 27 percent showing in October's election into six Cabinet
positions for his partisans.
</P>
<P>
   There's a painful conundrum here. Democratic values presume
respect for democratic outcomes, even unwelcome ones. But how do
you handle politicians who use democratic means to potentially
fascist ends?
</P>
<P>
   Europe's grandparents remember that Adolf Hitler leveraged an 18
percent showing in German elections into a dictatorship that led to
conquest, world war and holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's apology for his latest Nazi-sympathizing comment never
lasts longer than until his next similar utterance. Too, Austria,
unlike Germany, has little pondered or regretted its past
enthusiasm for Nazism _ and as recently as 1986 elected as
president the oily Kurt Waldheim despite evidence that as a German
officer in World War II he was at best indifferently proximate to
war crimes if not directly culpable.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freedom Party was elected for more reasons than Haider's
anti-immigrant demagoguery. It would free up much of Austria's
state-burdened economy and has posited itself as an alternative to
the winking deal by which for decades the country's two mainstream
parties have divvied up power and privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The unease of all democratic nations at Haider's involvement in
Austrian governance, even at arm's length, is heartfelt, but
Europe's has a bit of whistling-past-the-graveyard to it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every EU nation has a worrisome, similarly xenophobic
party _ Germany's People's Union, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National
Front in France. Italy's National Alliance is led by an actual
Musollini, his granddaughter Alessandra. Even the Scandinavian
countries, once famously tolerant, have new racist parties.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe experiencing unfamiliar immigration and inching
toward confederation _ a parliament of sorts, a multinational
bureaucracy, softening borders, common currency _ more such
reaction is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Can those emotions be managed, even reconciled, by the manners
and means of democracy? If not, can they be suppressed or would
they only be exacerbated by exclusion? The trick is to not harry
Austria into a defensive extremism but to be ready to act firmly if
it goes there on its own.

   JonBenet movies expose TV's ugliest side
</P>
<P>
   By Diane Holloway
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Just when you think commercial television can't
sink any lower, it does. Free falls past the gutter and down into
the sewer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of weeks, two TV movies will air on the
short life and brutal murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the tiny beauty
queen found dead in her home Christmas night 1996. The case remains
unsolved, although suspicion swirls around JonBenet's parents and
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this true story has no end doesn't seem to bother
the so-called ``creative'' people at the networks. Nor does it
bother them that they are seeking to capitalize on a 6-year-old
child's tragedy. The prospect of watching the horrors leading up to
the murder, as well as fleeting scenes of the murder itself, is
disgusting. It's tantamount to abusing this child all over again
and exploiting her in the grave.
</P>
<P>
   I'm slamming these movies sight unseen, something I've never
done in my 20-year career as a critic. I always felt it was
unprofessional to write about something without seeing it all the
way through. But I'm making an exception here for two reasons.
First, the concept is so awful that execution is almost beside the
point. Second, the networks, no doubt sensing that response would
not be favorable, did not provide preview tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fox drags out ``The JonBenet Ramsey
Story,'' a mini-movie that runs an hour instead of the usual two.
Press material touts it as ``form-breaking,'' but it may have been
cut short because even the producers were grossed out by it. The
Fox film claims to present the facts of the case provided by
investigating detectives and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is going all out with a four-hour miniseries, ``Perfect
Murder, Perfect Town,'' that's scheduled to air Feb. 27 and Mar. 1.
This one is based on the book by Lawrence Schiller. Viewers, we are
told, will have to draw their own conclusions about the killer's
identity from several theories that are posed.
</P>
<P>
   Titillation and exploitation sell, and not just on television.
JonBenet has become a cottage industry for the tabloids as well as
many legitimate publications. But television is the only medium
that's turning the story into entertainment with actors, sets,
cinematography, ominous music and dozens of commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that these two movies come during the
February rating period, when stations use the ratings to set their
ad rates. That's why murder stories dominate newsmagazines and
movies this time of year and why those revolting ``World's Worst
...'' specials do so well on Fox. They appeal to prurient
interests, and that's big business.
</P>
<P>
   People who watch these things get what they deserve. But the
networks ought to draw the line, no matter how much commercial gain
is at stake, when it comes to exploiting the murder of a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``What social good can possibly be served?'' wonders Ellen
Wartella, dean of the University of Texas's college of
communications and a long-time researcher into TV's content and
impact. ``It doesn't strike me, given that the case hasn't been
resolved, that there are any lessons to be learned here. All these
films can do is publicize the lurid aspects of a very sad case, and
I can say that without seeing the treatment. At the very least,
they're in very poor taste.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way we'll be able to get rid of this garbage is to stop
watching it. The networks aren't going to produce shows that don't
draw a crowd. No audience, no sordid stories. It's as simple as
that, so send these folks a message and stay away.

   ATLANTA _ ``African American Healers'' by Clinton Cox (John

made a difference in science and medicine. It highlights, among
others, Susie King Taylor, a Civil War nurse, and Charles Drew,
father of the blood bank. We wish there were more photographs and
that some of the pictures weren't so grainy (but hey, they're old).

 &HT;    Children who changed the world
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When 7-year-old Brittany Fuller told her mother that
she wanted to meet her idol, Ruby Bridges, it didn't click.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's mother, Kamala Burton, remembered the name vaguely
but couldn't put her finger on it. Was she a singer? An actress? A
WNBA player?
</P>
<P>
   The tiny second-grader reminded her mother that in 1960, at age
6, Bridges became the first black child to attend William Frantz
Public School in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   And because she was black, Bridges had to be escorted to school
every day by members of the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into the school, all of the white parents moved
their children out,'' Bridges said. ``They boycotted, and none of
the teachers would teach me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittany felt like she could relate to some of Bridges'
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the only African-American in my class,'' Brittany said.
``I think I could have done what she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges was in Atlanta recently to talk to young people about
what it was like to go to school under those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined by Ernest Green and Elizabeth Eckford. Green and
Eckford participated in the integration of Central High School in
Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   For many students today, it's hard to imagine what Eckford,
Green and Bridges went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to students,'' Eckford said, ``I have to paint a
picture because segregation is so alien to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law that said blacks
and whites could not ride in railroad cars together. It meant that
``separate but equal'' would be acceptable in keeping blacks and
whites apart in housing, jobs and education, too.
</P>
<P>
   But separate wasn't equal; blacks suffered in poor, unequipped
schools. So in 1954, another case, Brown versus Board of Education,
forced the desegregation of public schools. It meant blacks and
whites could go to school together.
</P>
<P>
   But in places like New Orleans and Little Rock, change took
time.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus refused to let black
students in the school, so President Dwight Eisenhower sent in
1,200 federal troops to guard the students.
</P>
<P>
   Eckford, who still lives in Little Rock and is a probation
officer, said the experience was so painful that she refused to
talk about it for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of pain, but I guess I have an obligation
now. If students can talk to older people, it makes what I am
trying to tell them more immediate and real,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Eckford's stories, it is easy to understand why she
refused to talk for so long. Imagine going to school every day and
getting called names by almost everybody. Eckford and Green were
spit on by other students. Eckford was pushed down the stairs once,
and her mother was fired from her job.
</P>
<P>
   At a book signing that featured Eckford, Green and Bridges,
Brittany waited patiently to meet her idol.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she made it to the front of the line. She hugged and
kissed Bridges, then sat in Bridges' lap as her mother took a
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are so overwhelmed by the story, and for me that is an
inspiration,'' Bridges said. ``It tells me there is hope and that
they are interested in things they should be interested in.''

 &HT;    Reform bill passes House
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia House of Representatives approved Gov. Roy
Barnes' education bill by an overwhelming margin last week. The
House voted 136 to 41 to pass the bill. The Georgia Senate also
must agree to the bill before it can become law.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's education bill calls for signing bonuses for
teachers in hard-to-fill schools, cash bonuses for teachers whose
students perform above expectation, and reductions in some class
sizes. The new law also would make it easier for teachers to be
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Many teacher groups are unhappy about the bill, because they
feel they are losing protection for their jobs. The bill is
expected to have some trouble passing the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   `BLUE'S CLUES' AND `BILL' MAY MOVE TO CBS
</P>
<P>
   Some of Nickelodeon's most popular children's shows soon may be
airing on CBS on Saturday mornings. It is one of the changes you'd
see if a merger between CBS and Viacom goes through as expected.
(Viacom owns Nickelodeon.) The merger would unite the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The networks haven't determined which shows would air on CBS,
but ``Blue's Clues'' and ``Little Bill'' are considered likely
bets.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would help both networks because Nickelodeon
would promote CBS' shows and CBS would do the same for Nick.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon's popular Saturday morning lineup shouldn't be
affected because it is geared toward a slightly older audience.
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFEY TRADED TO THE REDS
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. (above) is returning to the city where he played
Little League ball, starred for his high school baseball team and
watched his father play pro baseball: Cincinnati. The 10-time
All-Star wanted to leave the Seattle Mariners. He took less money
than other teams were willing to pay so he could play for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how much money you make. It's where you're
the happiest,'' said Griffey, wearing the jersey and cap of his new
team. ``I thought Cincinnati is the place I would be happiest.
Hopefully, I can have the same luck my father had here and win some
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, who played for the Reds, is now a coach for the
team. The Mariners received four players to give up Griffey.

 &HT;    A broad and fruitful field for gardeners
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's something especially appealing about mixing
the new with the old, whether it's in the garden or in life. Now
that it's time to start planning for spring, you have a chance to
use the newfangled Web to plan your old-fashioned garden.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is with two traditional seed and plant
catalogs that also have an impressive presence on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever planted a seed, surely you've heard of Burpee.
You'll find the online version of the venerable gardening catalog
at www.burpee.com/, at a page called Burpee Seeds Home Gardening.
Once there, you'll have a multitude of choices, including taking
the old-fashioned way out and ordering the company's print catalog.
You also may browse the online catalog, check out some recipes and
read the company's regional newsletter to learn about plants and
planting for your neck of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The other familiar name on today's garden tour is Gurney's.
You'll find Gurney's Seed &AMP; Nursery Co. nicely represented on the
Web at www.gurneys.com/. This site is not as elaborate as the one
run by Burpee. You can learn a little about the climate zone you
live in, order a print catalog or learn a little about the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the main purpose of this page is to allow you to order stuff
_ to literally take your print catalog, key in the product number
of what you want and order. Since garden catalogs _ both print and
online _ are such great dream books at this time of the year, this
site will mostly appeal to the hard-core Gurney's customer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dream books on the Web for gardeners _ places
where you can read descriptions and learn about your choices and
then either place an order or just use the data you learned to shop
at your local garden center.
</P>
<P>
   An example of a dream book online can be found at www
.chefsgarden.com/ and is called The Chef's Garden _ Herb Gardening
and Vegetable Gardening. For instance, if the unromantically named
506 Bush Tomato strikes your fancy, you can learn, just in the
ordering information, that it offers ``bright red fruit on vines
that only reach 18 inches tall. Plants are tolerant of sporadic
watering and yield very well. This is a good patio container plant.
Medium-large size tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. You'll get growing tips, learn about insects and
bugs (there's even a Bug of the Month) and get recipes here. If you
love plants, this is a good place to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Richter's Herbs _ Medicinal, Culinary and Aromatic _ Plants &AMP;
Seeds at www.richters.com/ is, as you would guess from the name, a
little out of the ordinary. It's also a little out of the United
States, located in Ontario, Canada. But it ships products all over
the world. Besides, the products that it offers are unusual and
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for organic seeds (obviously all are organic,
but these are grown to suit the specifications of organic
gardeners) or herbs, it's a good place to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a Web site that appeals to a specific type of
gardener, it's also rich in resources. For instance, you can take
online courses _ for free _ on the site. When last visited, the
topic was on how to make sure that your seeds germinate properly,
something that would interest gardeners of any type.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Heirloom Seeds and Rare Seeds at
www.Heirloom-Seeds.com/.
</P>
<P>
   As you would expect, this is the place to go to find seeds for
plant varieties that your grandparents would know and recognize.
There's a good selection.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because it's an old-fashioned joint, you will notice that
pages open very slowly here. But gardeners already know about
patience.

 &HT;    Despite snags, AirPort system good for wireless connections
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It almost sounds too good to be true. There's an easy
way to wirelessly connect two Macs for sharing or transferring
files or to connect several Macs from anywhere in a house through
one Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   But you can do this and more with Apple's new AirPort wireless
system. The bad news is that AirPort, as should be expected, is a
work in progress. The speed of connections is so-so, and there are
some glitches in the setup and ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   AirPort is the first wireless home system for personal
computers. It works through software, a base station, an antenna
and an installation card.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the AirPort has been incorporated in three models _
iBooks, G4s and iMac DVs. Each of these models has a special
built-in wireless antenna and special software.
</P>
<P>
   You still have to buy a $99 card that easily slips into each of
these models to enable AirPort.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of the system is a white-and-blue disc called the
AirPort base station. It serves as a wireless modem that lets up to
10 AirPort-equipped Macs connect to the Internet. And they can do
so from about 150 feet away. That means you can jump wirelessly
onto the Internet from just about anywhere in your house.
</P>
<P>
   Configuring the AirPort software is easy. There's an assistant
that walks you through the process. The software is intuitive
enough to import your existing online configuration, if you want.
</P>
<P>
   The software includes a separate control strip that runs along
the bottom of your screen. It monitors the strength of the AirPort
signal. It also lets you choose whether to connect via the base
station or with another Mac. You don't need the station to just
connect two Macs.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch is that AirPort won't work with America Online. That's
a big problem, given that AOL is the largest single provider of
Internet access. Hopefully, Apple will soon strike a deal with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that, while AirPort connections were highly
reliable, they were slow. That was especially true compared to the
standard connection, the 10BaseT Ethernet port built into most
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the connection slows even further if more than one
Mac is using the base station.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is transferring files among Macs through AirPort speedy. It
takes two to four times longer to transfer a file wirelessly than
through an Ethernet connection.
</P>
<P>
   And a final peeve. Apple has made it cumbersome to restore a
lost connection through AirPort's current setup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these drawbacks, AirPort is off to a good start. Surely
it will only get stronger with the inevitable upgrades. Indeed,
AirPort software upgrade 1.1 has just been released.

 &HT;    Discovery lures TV crowd to Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo is now, and probably will be for the foreseeable
future, the country's most popular Web site. It is one of the most
recognizable brands on the Web and offers users everything from
searches to auctions, fantasy baseball, online shopping and
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   But stand back Yahoo, traditional media are hot on your trail.
You've got serious competition from some pretty big names,
targeting an audience that may like Yahoo but really loves
television. One day, that could make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Discovery Networks, best known for its popular cable
channels, took its Web site and turned it into a full-fledged
portal for families and fans of the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The new site offers users information about programming on the
Discovery Channel, the Travel Channel, the Learning Network, Animal
Planet and Discovery Health Online. A second area called Web
Express is a well-designed portal site that will link users to a
variety of search engines (including Yahoo). Users can also check
stock prices, read horoscopes, chat or look up information on
everything from cars to careers or even visit a special area for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Michela English, who heads up Discovery's online ventures, said
the evolution from a Web site simply promoting TV shows to a unique
family/portal/TV/e-commerce site was a steady process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We launched our first Web site in 1995, in support of our TV
networks,'' she said. ``Now it's a set of tools, not necessarily
focused on Discovery. The launch marks an evolution of our strategy
and our company's commitment to make the Discovery brand an
Internet brand. We say we want to help people to explore their
world, but we want to also be relevant to everyday life. Using the
Discovery brand means we can throw the weight of the TV and retail
stores behind that brand to build a family of sites under the
Discovery gateway.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery.com wants to move the fans of the cable channels onto
the Web site, something NBC has been doing with its online
properties including the NBC Web site, the portal site Snap, the
community/home page site Xoom.com, and news and information site
MSNBC.com, a joint venture with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Media executives say the move to take a loyal TV audience and
turn it into a loyal Web audience is something at which traditional
media companies excel. They say the goal of a media company working
to establish a Web presence is to take the viewer, turn him into an
Internet user, then into a member, then a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Discover seems to be following that plan. It already has deals
with online retailers including Amazon.com., moviephone.com, CDNow
and others to add e-commerce to the site's revenue stream. The
Discovery Store online also offers a variety of gifts and goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC Interactive and Discovery.com have the right
demographics for online Web success. NBC television has a young,
hip audience that uses the Web either at home or at work and has
enough confidence in the network to check out its Web sites, which
are promoted both in programming and commercials for its various
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery also has the right demographics for Web success. Its
core audience includes everyone from hard-core science junkies to
kids looking for homework help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw really a broad audience,'' English says. ``We have the
hard-core science aficionados. When we follow space shots, we'll
get families and a traditional male audience that is interested in
that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   English says the revamped Discovery site isn't limited to
science lovers and students. She wants to attract the widest
audience possible. ``We think of ourselves as family-oriented,''
she said, adding that the new users coming online _ especially
women and kids _ will want to log on to familiar brands and find
what they want with a minimum of fuss. ``We want to meet that need
to offer general interest and offer them the opportunity to
transact business or subscribe to a service,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery has no illusions it's the next Yahoo, but if it can
bring its loyal TV audience to the Web and keep it there, the
company might be on to something.

 &HT;    PC World provides the lowdown on upgrading to Windows 2000
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Working
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're considering upgrading to Windows 2000,
Microsoft's latest operating system, check out the March issue of
PC World. The cover story tells how to install, as smoothly as
possible, this latest operating system, due out Thursday. The good
news is that the magazine says Windows 2000 is Microsoft's most
stable and capable operating system yet. It offers, for example,
vastly improved hardware and software compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the bad news: The magazine found that, depending on your
computer, upgrading to Windows 2000 is either a breeze or a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can explore the New World again as a band of Europeans in a
game called ``1602 A.D.'' You establish settlements, expanding them
through trade, diplomacy and war. The game lets you play against
the computer or against up to four people on a network. You can
also customize the world you want to explore and the campaign you
lead. Published by GT Interactive Software, ``1602 A.D.'' is
available only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Once you create a city, you can create the people who live in it
_ all part of the latest simulation game from Maxis. Called ``The
Sims,'' this game lets users create a character and move in it
through the world. Win friends by throwing pool parties. Go after a
well-paying job and buy a big house. ``The Sims'' is available only
for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Financial services are a large and growing presence on the
Internet. Some let you pay bills online. You pay a monthly fee, say
$9, and the service notifies you of when bills come in and even if
you have enough money to pay them. One of these services that has
gotten good reviews is Paymybills.com. Check out the review in the
March issue of PC World. You'll find the site at
www.paymybills.com/index.html.

 &HT;    Desktop Translator still not as good as it should be
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Desktop Translator, in its latest version, boasts
Internet capabilities and will not only attempt to translate your
writing but your spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the attempts at translation have not
significantly improved since the last time I looked at it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if one confines one's translating requirements to
international business, which is really what the publisher,
Transparent Language, intends the program for, it might be
acceptable. However, no one writes business letters to me in
anything but English, and they don't write them for long because I
don't answer them in any language.
</P>
<P>
   So in order to check out Desktop Translator, I must take to the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The program can be used in a window mode, in which one pastes
the copy to be translated into one window and the translation
appears below. In this mode, the translation can also be spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Other modes for accessing the program include a toolbar and a
place on the taskbar; in these configurations Desktop Translator
can be used to translate an entire Web page, no matter which
browser you're using. Still another mode is used when the user
wants to dictate to the program.
</P>
<P>
   The program can be used to translate between English and
Spanish, French and German, and from English to Portuguese and
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   I tried Spanish to English.
</P>
<P>
   From a Spanish Web page providing a brief biography of Pablo
Picasso, I excerpt one translated paragraph from the section on his
cubist period:
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspired by the processing volumEtrico of the forms pictUricas
of Paul CEzanne, Picasso and Georges Braque they painted in 1908 a
series of landscapes inside a style that a critic described later
as if had been based on facts 'small buckets', being imposed thus
the term cubismo. Among 1908 and 1911 they worked in narrow
contribution inside this line of disorder and analysis of the
forms, developing juntos the first phase of the cubism,
acquaintance as cubism analytic.''
</P>
<P>
   While anyone with a smattering of knowledge of Picasso's work
can muddle through that to a fair degree, I certainly wouldn't want
to risk having something I wrote put through that sort of mangler.
</P>
<P>
   On the same site with the Picasso biography there was a short
biography of Salvador Dali. But instead of quoting from a
translation of that text, I bring you something more surreal than
anything Dali ever painted. It is Desktop Translator's version of
the story of ``El Largarto de la Catedral,'' which DT entitled
``The Lizard of the Cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that in a section of the Cathedral of Seville one can
find hanging from the roof ``a crocodile of natural size, a bite of
horse and a cane of command.'' The genesis of this bizarre trio, it
is said, came in the year 1260, when ``the sultan of Egypt sent an
embassy to the King Alfonso X the Wise one to ask the hand of its
daughter Berenguela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embassy brought diverse presents, among them a beautiful
eyetooth of elephant, a crocodile of the Nile alive and a giraffe
domesticated with its setting and its brake and flanges.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso, it goes on to say, was loath to give the hand of his
daughter to this sultan, as well he should have been, I might add.
Anyone who sends me crocodiles alive and a giraffe with brake and
flanges is not apt to get my daughter's hand. Next thing you know
it might be hanging from his turret. At any rate, Alfonso sent back
gifts for the sultan, and, according to DT, ``here they remained
the crocodile and the giraffe. Past the time, and dead person the
crocodile, was dissected, and their skin fills of paja went hanging
of the Patio of the Nranjos together with the brake of the giraffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years later, hung like remembrance the stick of the Spanish
ambassador that returned from Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no further mention of the ``bite of horse.'' Perhaps a
bite of horse is synonymous with a giraffe flange. I don't know,
and I don't think Desktop Translator is going to tell me.

 &HT;    Take it from an old hacker: Recent fears are overblown
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the beginning of the computer age, there were
hackers. The word had a slightly different meaning back then. A
hacker was a computer hobbyist who didn't love computers because
they were useful, instead he loved them because they were
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of being a hacker was not, in those days, breaking
into computers and computer networks _ but don't let anyone kid
you, there was plenty of that going on.
</P>
<P>
   I know because I was a hacker. I wasn't a genius hacker; there
was no danger of my getting rich because of my computer knowledge.
I wasn't smart enough. Nor was there much danger that I'd someday
be the anti-hero of a movie because of my skill at breaking into
computer networks. When it came to skill and to breaking into
networks, I was no more than fair-to-middling.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's enough to make it easier to talk to you about
what's going on these days. It's difficult to pick up a newspaper
without finding a banner headline talking about hackers bringing
some Web site to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   When I talk to my friends, I keep hearing dark fears that
there's some sort of sophisticated international conspiracy
designed to bring the Internet down. In fact, a lot of what I hear
reminds me of the hysteria Y2K stirred. It was going to be the end
of the world as we know it, and it turned out to be less potent
than an old-fashioned ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   First, you need to know that in some ways _ despite the growth
of sophistication of security on the Net and the World Wide Web _
that hacking is easier than ever. Nowadays, a beginning hacker
doesn't have to write the computer code for a hacking program.
Instead, you can download these programs from the Web _ a nice
piece of irony in itself, since Web sites have been the primary
target. So while there are sophisticated hackers out there, the
majority are cookbook hackers, following directions found on Web
sites, using tools downloaded from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Second, keep in mind that the recent attacks on Yahoo, eBay and
CNN.com (by the time you read this there may be more _ I'll explain
why before I'm done) were denial-of-service attacks. In no case did
the hacker get secret information or break in and steal passwords
or personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they jammed up the system by trying to connect to it
from a variety of servers (computers connected to the Net). It's
really no different from a prankster tying up your phone line by
redialing it over and over. I'm not saying that hackers are
incapable of breaking into networks and performing some of the
feats that movies are written about. But that kind of hacking is
more difficult and requires entirely different skills.
</P>
<P>
   Third, despite what the experts say, I'm not sure that there is
a big and well-organized conspiracy here. Instead, that one hacking
exploit, say, bringing Yahoo to its knees, brings out the ``me,
too'' hackers who want to prove that they can do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   While there are big hacker organizations _ you can find many on
the Web by doing a search _ historically the best hackers, and the
best criminals in general, have worked alone and are as shy as a
15-year-old on a first date. These vandals want publicity; the
people you should fear most do not. But since this ``me, too''
mentality is a fact of life, you probably will see more incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, the smartest computer security experts I know are
getting rich because they are smart. They end up getting jobs with
computer networks and making a lot of money. A lot of them start
out as hackers. The good news is that the best and the brightest
generally go to work trying to stop the worst and the dullest.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not telling you that there is nothing to worry about when it
comes to hacking. But I am saying that _ when it comes to worrying
about criminal acts _ to worry about getting a good deadbolt lock
for the front door of your home and to make sure not to leave the
keys in your cars. The real world is still a more dangerous place
than cyberspace.

 &HT;    Despite snags, AirPort system good for wireless connections
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It almost sounds too good to be true. There's an easy
way to wirelessly connect two Macs for sharing or transferring
files or to connect several Macs from anywhere in a house through
one Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   But you can do this and more with Apple's new AirPort wireless
system. The bad news is that AirPort, as should be expected, is a
work in progress. The speed of connections is so-so, and there are
some glitches in the setup and ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   AirPort is the first wireless home system for personal
computers. It works through software, a base station, an antenna
and an installation card.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the AirPort has been incorporated in three models _

so from about 150 feet away. That means you can jump wirelessly

</P>
<P>
   Configuring the AirPort software is easy. There's an assistant
that walks you through the process. The software is intuitive
enough to import your existing online configuration, if you want.
</P>
<P>
   The software includes a separate control strip that runs along
the bottom of your screen. It monitors the strength of the AirPort
signal. It also lets you choose whether to connect via the base
station or with another Mac. You don't need the station to just
connect two Macs.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch is that AirPort won't work with America Online. That's
a big problem, given that AOL is the largest single provider of
Internet access. Hopefully, Apple will soon strike a deal with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that, while AirPort connections were highly

enough confidence in the network to check out its Web sites, which
are promoted both in programming and commercials for its various
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery also has the right demographics for Web success. Its
core audience includes everyone from hard-core science junkies to
kids looking for homework help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw really a broad audience,'' English says. ``We have the
hard-core science aficionados. When we follow space shots, we'll
get families and a traditional male audience that is interested in
that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   English says the revamped Discovery site isn't limited to
science lovers and students. She wants to attract the widest
audience possible. ``We think of ourselves as family-oriented,''
she said, adding that the new users coming online _ especially
women and kids _ will want to log on to familiar brands and find
what they want with a minimum of fuss. ``We want to meet that need
to offer general interest and offer them the opportunity to
transact business or subscribe to a service,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery has no illusions it's the next Yahoo, but if it can
bring its loyal TV audience to the Web and keep it there, the
company might be on to something.

 &HT;    Moms offered intellectualism
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Talk to women who left jobs to raise children, and
some say they miss the office camaraderie, the chance to talk to
someone not wearing diapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can bring the small talk and the big talk to your
home. Salon, an online magazine, has an online discussion group
called Mothers Who Think. The site, which can be reached from a
link off www.salon.com, offers several topics for discussion,
including: ``Why Marriage?,'' ``Mommy or Joseph Stalin,'' and ``Dr.
Laura is a despicable, guilt-mongering hypocrite; why would anyone
seek her opinion on anything?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular topics is called ``How long are you
going to do that? And other breast-feeding topics.'' A person with
the screen name of Jody2ms started the discussion in August 1998
with this post:
</P>
<P>
   ``My father in-law asked me, `When are you going to stop that
nonsense?' I replied, while nursing my 4-month-old, `I hope to have
him weaned by the time he starts college, because we would like him
to attend out of state if he wants.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Steele started this discussion thread in January:
``Stay-At-Home Moms: How do you have an intellectual life with
other women?
</P>
<P>
   ``When most of the women you meet in mothers' groups want to
talk about kids and consuming? I mean, I take care of her and
that's enough, I don't want to talk about it as well. I need to
discuss adult things when I'm around other adults. I miss the
discussion of ideas and culture I used to have with my old
co-workers ... sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent posts dealt with a book, ``The Playgroup,''
by Nina Barrett. Such as this one, from RobinM:
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I have been telling all my friends, the other moms in my
play group, and here about this book, and finally someone actually
reads it too ... I was struck by finding women who were just as
ambitious as I was/am, but rattled by how much good mothering is
important to me and how hard it is to define it. I was/am (unhappy)
that my husband didn't have to deal with the same self-doubts
regarding his work and his fatherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon is a free online magazine. Participation in the discussion
groups requires registration, which is also free.

   RAY LEWIS' STORY, RIGHT FROM THE START
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is an interesting place.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jan. 31, Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray
Lewis is jailed in connection with the slaying of two men. Three
days later, two Ravens fans in suburban Baltimore start the process
of setting up a Web site designed to get the word out to people
interested in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.freeraylewis.com, offers Free Ray Lewis T-shirts,
a brief biography of Lewis, links to news Web sites that carry
stories on the slayings and a place for people to talk about the
issue. The site also features a poll. Last Wednesday, 550 of the
612 votes were from Ravens fans. Of those, 60 percent, 367, don't
think Lewis did it.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Silberg, the 27-year-old who started the site with friend
Michael Snyder, said the meaning of the Web site address
(freeraylewis.com) is not a statement of innocence but simply a
desire that Lewis be freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that you can only judge a person on what they've
done up to this point,'' said Silberg. ``And up to this point, he's
showed an amazing amount of determination, not only as a player but
in his personal life. We know that from hearing his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if he is found guilty, all bets are off. We're just trying
to create a forum so when people sit down and have a conversation
about this, they do it on facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silberg and Snyder are selling T-shirts but only to recover the
few thousand dollars they paid to have the site built, Silberg
said.

 &HT;    Desktop Translator still not as good as it should be
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Desktop Translator, in its latest version, boasts
Internet capabilities and will not only attempt to translate your
writing but your spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the attempts at translation have not
significantly improved since the last time I looked at it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if one confines one's translating requirements to
international business, which is really what the publisher,
Transparent Language, intends the program for, it might be
acceptable. However, no one writes business letters to me in
anything but English, and they don't write them for long because I
don't answer them in any language.
</P>
<P>
   So in order to check out Desktop Translator, I must take to the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The program can be used in a window mode, in which one pastes
the copy to be translated into one window and the translation
appears below. In this mode, the translation can also be spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Other modes for accessing the program include a toolbar and a
place on the taskbar; in these configurations Desktop Translator
can be used to translate an entire Web page, no matter which
browser you're using. Still another mode is used when the user
wants to dictate to the program.
</P>
<P>
   The program can be used to translate between English and
Spanish, French and German, and from English to Portuguese and
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   I tried Spanish to English.
</P>
<P>
   From a Spanish Web page providing a brief biography of Pablo
Picasso, I excerpt one translated paragraph from the section on his
cubist period:
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspired by the processing volumEtrico of the forms pictUricas
of Paul CEzanne, Picasso and Georges Braque they painted in 1908 a
series of landscapes inside a style that a critic described later
as if had been based on facts 'small buckets', being imposed thus
the term cubismo. Among 1908 and 1911 they worked in narrow
contribution inside this line of disorder and analysis of the
forms, developing juntos the first phase of the cubism,
acquaintance as cubism analytic.''
</P>
<P>
   While anyone with a smattering of knowledge of Picasso's work
can muddle through that to a fair degree, I certainly wouldn't want
to risk having something I wrote put through that sort of mangler.
</P>
<P>
   On the same site with the Picasso biography there was a short
biography of Salvador Dali. But instead of quoting from a
translation of that text, I bring you something more surreal than
anything Dali ever painted. It is Desktop Translator's version of
the story of ``El Largarto de la Catedral,'' which DT entitled
``The Lizard of the Cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that in a section of the Cathedral of Seville one can
find hanging from the roof ``a crocodile of natural size, a bite of
horse and a cane of command.'' The genesis of this bizarre trio, it
is said, came in the year 1260, when ``the sultan of Egypt sent an
embassy to the King Alfonso X the Wise one to ask the hand of its
daughter Berenguela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embassy brought diverse presents, among them a beautiful
eyetooth of elephant, a crocodile of the Nile alive and a giraffe
domesticated with its setting and its brake and flanges.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso, it goes on to say, was loath to give the hand of his
daughter to this sultan, as well he should have been, I might add.
Anyone who sends me crocodiles alive and a giraffe with brake and
flanges is not apt to get my daughter's hand. Next thing you know
it might be hanging from his turret. At any rate, Alfonso sent back
gifts for the sultan, and, according to DT, ``here they remained
the crocodile and the giraffe. Past the time, and dead person the
crocodile, was dissected, and their skin fills of paja went hanging
of the Patio of the Nranjos together with the brake of the giraffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years later, hung like remembrance the stick of the Spanish
ambassador that returned from Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no further mention of the ``bite of horse.'' Perhaps a
bite of horse is synonymous with a giraffe flange. I don't know,
and I don't think Desktop Translator is going to tell me.

 &HT;    A broad and fruitful field for gardeners
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's something especially appealing about mixing
the new with the old, whether it's in the garden or in life. Now
that it's time to start planning for spring, you have a chance to
use the newfangled Web to plan your old-fashioned garden.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is with two traditional seed and plant
catalogs that also have an impressive presence on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever planted a seed, surely you've heard of Burpee.
You'll find the online version of the venerable gardening catalog
at www.burpee.com/, at a page called Burpee Seeds Home Gardening.
Once there, you'll have a multitude of choices, including taking
the old-fashioned way out and ordering the company's print catalog.
You also may browse the online catalog, check out some recipes and
read the company's regional newsletter to learn about plants and
planting for your neck of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The other familiar name on today's garden tour is Gurney's.
You'll find Gurney's Seed &AMP; Nursery Co. nicely represented on the
Web at www.gurneys.com/. This site is not as elaborate as the one
run by Burpee. You can learn a little about the climate zone you
live in, order a print catalog or learn a little about the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the main purpose of this page is to allow you to order stuff
_ to literally take your print catalog, key in the product number
of what you want and order. Since garden catalogs _ both print and
online _ are such great dream books at this time of the year, this
site will mostly appeal to the hard-core Gurney's customer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dream books on the Web for gardeners _ places
where you can read descriptions and learn about your choices and
then either place an order or just use the data you learned to shop
at your local garden center.
</P>
<P>
   An example of a dream book online can be found at www
.chefsgarden.com/ and is called The Chef's Garden _ Herb Gardening
and Vegetable Gardening. For instance, if the unromantically named
506 Bush Tomato strikes your fancy, you can learn, just in the
ordering information, that it offers ``bright red fruit on vines
that only reach 18 inches tall. Plants are tolerant of sporadic
watering and yield very well. This is a good patio container plant.
Medium-large size tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. You'll get growing tips, learn about insects and
bugs (there's even a Bug of the Month) and get recipes here. If you
love plants, this is a good place to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Richter's Herbs _ Medicinal, Culinary and Aromatic _ Plants &AMP;
Seeds at www.richters.com/ is, as you would guess from the name, a
little out of the ordinary. It's also a little out of the United
States, located in Ontario, Canada. But it ships products all over
the world. Besides, the products that it offers are unusual and
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for organic seeds (obviously all are organic,
but these are grown to suit the specifications of organic
gardeners) or herbs, it's a good place to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a Web site that appeals to a specific type of
gardener, it's also rich in resources. For instance, you can take
online courses _ for free _ on the site. When last visited, the
topic was on how to make sure that your seeds germinate properly,
something that would interest gardeners of any type.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Heirloom Seeds and Rare Seeds at
www.Heirloom-Seeds.com/.
</P>
<P>
   As you would expect, this is the place to go to find seeds for
plant varieties that your grandparents would know and recognize.
There's a good selection.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because it's an old-fashioned joint, you will notice that
pages open very slowly here. But gardeners already know about
patience.

 &HT;    PC World provides the lowdown on upgrading to Windows 2000
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Working
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're considering upgrading to Windows 2000,
Microsoft's latest operating system, check out the March issue of
PC World. The cover story tells how to install, as smoothly as
possible, this latest operating system, due out Thursday. The good
news is that the magazine says Windows 2000 is Microsoft's most
stable and capable operating system yet. It offers, for example,
vastly improved hardware and software compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the bad news: The magazine found that, depending on your
computer, upgrading to Windows 2000 is either a breeze or a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can explore the New World again as a band of Europeans in a
game called ``1602 A.D.'' You establish settlements, expanding them
through trade, diplomacy and war. The game lets you play against
the computer or against up to four people on a network. You can
also customize the world you want to explore and the campaign you
lead. Published by GT Interactive Software, ``1602 A.D.'' is
available only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Once you create a city, you can create the people who live in it
_ all part of the latest simulation game from Maxis. Called ``The
Sims,'' this game lets users create a character and move in it
through the world. Win friends by throwing pool parties. Go after a
well-paying job and buy a big house. ``The Sims'' is available only
for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Financial services are a large and growing presence on the
Internet. Some let you pay bills online. You pay a monthly fee, say
$9, and the service notifies you of when bills come in and even if
you have enough money to pay them. One of these services that has
gotten good reviews is Paymybills.com. Check out the review in the
March issue of PC World. You'll find the site at
www.paymybills.com/index.html.

 &HT;    Take it from an old hacker: Recent fears are overblown
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the beginning of the computer age, there were
hackers. The word had a slightly different meaning back then. A
hacker was a computer hobbyist who didn't love computers because
they were useful, instead he loved them because they were
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of being a hacker was not, in those days, breaking
into computers and computer networks _ but don't let anyone kid
you, there was plenty of that going on.
</P>
<P>
   I know because I was a hacker. I wasn't a genius hacker; there
was no danger of my getting rich because of my computer knowledge.
I wasn't smart enough. Nor was there much danger that I'd someday
be the anti-hero of a movie because of my skill at breaking into
computer networks. When it came to skill and to breaking into
networks, I was no more than fair-to-middling.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's enough to make it easier to talk to you about
what's going on these days. It's difficult to pick up a newspaper
without finding a banner headline talking about hackers bringing
some Web site to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   When I talk to my friends, I keep hearing dark fears that
there's some sort of sophisticated international conspiracy
designed to bring the Internet down. In fact, a lot of what I hear
reminds me of the hysteria Y2K stirred. It was going to be the end
of the world as we know it, and it turned out to be less potent
than an old-fashioned ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   First, you need to know that in some ways _ despite the growth
of sophistication of security on the Net and the World Wide Web _
that hacking is easier than ever. Nowadays, a beginning hacker
doesn't have to write the computer code for a hacking program.
Instead, you can download these programs from the Web _ a nice
piece of irony in itself, since Web sites have been the primary
target. So while there are sophisticated hackers out there, the
majority are cookbook hackers, following directions found on Web
sites, using tools downloaded from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Second, keep in mind that the recent attacks on Yahoo, eBay and
CNN.com (by the time you read this there may be more _ I'll explain
why before I'm done) were denial-of-service attacks. In no case did
the hacker get secret information or break in and steal passwords
or personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they jammed up the system by trying to connect to it
from a variety of servers (computers connected to the Net). It's
really no different from a prankster tying up your phone line by
redialing it over and over. I'm not saying that hackers are
incapable of breaking into networks and performing some of the
feats that movies are written about. But that kind of hacking is
more difficult and requires entirely different skills.
</P>
<P>
   Third, despite what the experts say, I'm not sure that there is
a big and well-organized conspiracy here. Instead, that one hacking
exploit, say, bringing Yahoo to its knees, brings out the ``me,
too'' hackers who want to prove that they can do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   While there are big hacker organizations _ you can find many on
the Web by doing a search _ historically the best hackers, and the
best criminals in general, have worked alone and are as shy as a
15-year-old on a first date. These vandals want publicity; the
people you should fear most do not. But since this ``me, too''
mentality is a fact of life, you probably will see more incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, the smartest computer security experts I know are
getting rich because they are smart. They end up getting jobs with
computer networks and making a lot of money. A lot of them start
out as hackers. The good news is that the best and the brightest
generally go to work trying to stop the worst and the dullest.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not telling you that there is nothing to worry about when it
comes to hacking. But I am saying that _ when it comes to worrying
about criminal acts _ to worry about getting a good deadbolt lock
for the front door of your home and to make sure not to leave the
keys in your cars. The real world is still a more dangerous place
than cyberspace.

 &HT;    Fast 50: Woods seek return to glory
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Va. _ When Eddie Wood saw David Pearson walk into the
Wood Brothers' shop to help start the team's 50th year in NASCAR,
the afternoon of Feb. 15, 1976, seemed like only yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Pearson outran Richard Petty to give the Woods one
of their most memorable victories and one of NASCAR's most exciting
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Wood is the son of team founder Glen Wood and the nephew
of Leonard Wood, who was the mechanical genius behind the team that
has won 96 races and 112 pole positions. Their 80 superspeedway
victories are a NASCAR record, as are their 53 500-mile race
victories, 87 superspeedway poles and 26 superspeedway races won
from the pole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the Woods were dominant on the big tracks. While
driving their No. 21, Pearson won 43 times, finished second 29
times and won 51 poles.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, most teams had only one crew member in contact
with the driver; today, numerous team members have radios. Eddie
Wood had on the headset to talk to Pearson for the '76 Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember every word that was said on that last lap,''
Wood said. ``When they got the white flag, David was behind
Richard. They went into turn one, and he hasn't said anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off turn two, he said, `I'm going to try him here.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They get into turn three. We can't see from the pit area, but
we're watching the crowd standing up, so you know he's doing
something. (Pearson) said, ``I got him.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then (Pearson) goes up the track a little bit, and Richard
goes to the bottom and gets back under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go all the way to the exit of turn four, and (Pearson)
said, 'He's under me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That lasted for a second or two, and then he said, `The
(expletive) hit me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd is up, and the car's spinning backward, and he said,
`Where's Richard?', just as calm as we're sitting here talking,
maybe calmer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I come back and say, `He's up here. He stopped.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And (Pearson) said, `Well, I'm coming.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had any emotion in his voice as far as excitement or
being mad. That's why they called him the Silver Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's wrecked Mercury limping past Petty's crumpled Dodge to
take the checkered flag has been shown over and over through the
years. For the Woods, it was one of their two best days at Daytona;
the other was in 1963 when the late Tiny Lund drove their car to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lund was a last-minute substitute. He earned the ride after he
helped pull Woods' driver Marvin Panch from a burning sports car
during a race at the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson and the Woods continued to win races, but they split up
after an unfortunate incident on pit road during a race at
Darlington. Pearson didn't know the team planned to change four
tires and drove off when the crew, after changing right-side tires,
dropped the car. It came to rest on pit road when the left-side
tires fell off.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson was released as the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Wood said he waited nearly 30 years before he told
Pearson that he and Glen wanted to back out of firing him but were
pressured into going ahead with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already making plans for what we were going to go to
Martinsville (the next race), but the sponsor wanted to go through
with (the firing),'' Leonard Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said he harbors no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gotten to where we didn't agree on things, so a break-up
was coming,'' Pearson said. ``But we've always been friends, and we
always will be. These people are like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson ran a limited schedule before retiring. His best
post-Wood Brothers run came as a substitute for the injured Dale
Earnhardt, then a Winston Cup rookie. Pearson won the Southern 500
at Darlington in Earnhardt's car.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods, without Pearson, lost their stranglehold on the
superspeedways. The highlights since Pearson, the Woods say, have
been putting Kyle Petty and Dale Jarrett in Victory Lane for the
first time in their careers. The Woods last win came at Atlanta
Motor Speedway in 1993, with Morgan Shepherd at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Today their driver is fellow Virginian Elliott Sadler, who hopes
to return the No. 21 Ford to the glory days. Sadler had a slow
start in 1999, his rookie year, but he improved as the circuit made
its second-round stops at the major tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caliber of the team was always there, but the driver had
to learn and go through some bumps and bruises,'' Sadler said.
``We're looking forward to the 2000 season and hope the 50th
anniversary gives us some momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woods aren't expecting a win just yet, but a few top-five
fiand a pole would be satisfying, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods will commemorate their 50th year by having five
different paint schemes _ one for each decade the team has
competed. The first special look will come at AMS in March when the
car's paint scheme will flash back to Shepherd's win in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The second special paint job will be for the April race at
Talladega. That car will carry the same colors as the one driven by
the late Neil Bonnett in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   For the World 600 at Lowe's Speedway in May, the car will look
like the one Pearson drove from 1974-1979, a time in which he won
12 consecutive poles and three races at the Charlotte track.
</P>
<P>
   For the Daytona race in July, Lund's colors will be on the car,
and when the circuit travels to the Woods' home track,
Martinsville, in October, the No. 21 Ford will be painted like the
car that team founder Glen Wood drove in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Glen started racing by chance. He was part owner of a car, and
the driver didn't show up for the race, so Glen filled in.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I never thought it would have been like this 50 years
later.''

 &HT;    Waiting for the sound of disaster
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The voices.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cash is in his small, windowless laboratory on the sixth
floor of the nondescript Washington office building where the
National Transportation Safety Board is headquartered. Cash is the
NTSB man who listens to the cockpit voice recorder _ one of two
``black boxes'' that collect voice and mechanical data on
commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   He's surrounded by reel-to-reel tape recorders and punctured,
gouged and crumpled steel alloy boxes. They're red, not black. The
boxes held the recorder that made the tapes that carry the last
words of airline crews _ ValuJet Flight 592, TWA Flight 800, a
California commuter jet brought down by a gun-wielding passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Cash will soon listen to the pilots' last words as Alaskan
Airlines Flight 261 fell toward the Pacific Ocean on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard more than 500 cockpit recorder tapes since joining
the safety board in 1982. He's heard screams, pops, thumps,
mysterious bangs, pilots grunting as they pull on the stick.
Gunshots. And always, silence _ sudden and final silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to me once, the voices,'' Cash says. ``That was the
first tape, a commuter plane. Prop flew off. I can't let the voices
get to me. I have to let them talk to me, let them tell me what
happened, but I can't let them get to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes speak.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall from Cash's lab, in another windowless room,
information from flight data recorders is downloaded by NTSB
technicians. The data recorder is the other black box on civilian
aircraft. It records anywhere from 11 to more than 300 data
parameters, including engine oil pressure, airspeed, altitude,
cockpit controls and heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal minimum for older planes is 11 parameters, 28 on new
planes,'' says Cash. ``European planes can monitor hundreds of
systems. But our fleet ... usually the minimum. Eleven is often
enough to get an idea of what happened to a plane. But if we
monitored 200 to 300 parameters, the planes could really talk to
us. Every time a recorder comes in I think, `Please, let it have
more than 11.' But if it's a U.S. plane, it's usually 11.'' The
flight data recorder on Alaska Airlines 261 monitored 48 systems.
The rear horizontal stabilizer _ thought to have been instrumental
in bringing the plane down _ was one of the 48. Monitoring the
stabilizer is not required, and Alaska Airlines had told the safety
board it did not know if Flight 261's box monitored the stabilizer.
Investigators are now examining the data for clues to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Broken metal sometimes speaks loudest of all, a lexicon of metal
fatigue, stress, microscopic imperfections and hairline fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wildey, head NTSB metallurgist, transcribes the metallic
messages with electronic scanning microscopes. He examined the
crumpled fuselage of TWA 800, charred fragments from the forward
cargo hold on ValuJet 592. His job boils down to determining
whether burns, fractures and cracks in metal occurred before,
during or after an airline accident. Or caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A report Wildey's now working on will form the technical
backbone of a safety board investigation that began on Sept. 12 in
West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   On that Sunday morning, Continental Airlines Flight 1933 _ bound
for Houston with 84 passengers and five crew members _ took off to
the east from Palm Beach International Airport. About 20 seconds
after takeoff, as the Boeing 737 was climbing through 800 feet at a
speed of about 190 mph, a turbine seal in the left engine
fractured, and the engine blew apart. The pilot took the plane
safely back to PBIA. Engine parts rained down into the neighborhood
below. Nobody on the ground or on board the plane was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, Jeff Kennedy, one of six NTSB investigators
based in Miami, was on the scene and in charge of the
investigation. The safety board is the lead agency in air crashes,
unless a crime has been committed. In that case, the FBI takes
over.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy knew that Jim Wildey and his metallurgical skills would
come into play.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a big investigation, but it's important. They're all
important, says Wildey.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the NTSB's job _ as spelled out by Congress _ is
to solve transportation accidents _ civil aviation, buses,
interstate trucks, trains, even gas pipeline mishaps. Once it
solves a case, the board makes safety recommendations to regulatory
agencies, the FAA in the case of air transport.
</P>
<P>
   BEST IN THE BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   It's a small agency, fewer than 400 employees, a budget of less
than $55 million _ or about 18 cents per U.S. citizen. It has
solved almost all of the country's 110,000 civilian aviation
accidents and incidents since 1967. Its investigators are the best
in the business, according to pilots, aviation engineers and a
recent audit conducted by the RAND Corporation at the request of
the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   But changes may be in the air at the agency. Political, social
and scientific forces and theories _ some untried and perhaps
untrue _ may push the board in new directions:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, Congress made the NTSB the lead agency in meeting the
needs of families and victims of an air crash, including
translation services, family counseling and victim identification.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward family services is seen by some as a move away
from the board's primary mission of investigating crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the cancer in the NTSB,'' says William Langewiesche, a
former commercial pilot, Atlantic correspondent and author of
numerous essays and ``Inside the Sky,'' a book on air safety,
flying and aviation accident investigation. ``It may sound cold,
but unless a body has some bearing on the cause of a crash _ powder
burns or a bullet hole _ it's not relevant to the investigation.
I'm sorry about the victims, but I want the NTSB to find the cause
in order to prevent future accidents, future victims. Safety, not
solace, is their job.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The party system of investigating crashes, which can include
carriers, manufacturers and pilot unions and can result in
conflicting agendas, should be changed, according to the RAND
audit.
</P>
<P>
   _ The complexity of modern aircraft has outstripped traditional
investigative methods. The board should engage in less reactive and
more ``pro-active'' research, the audit said, and seek the help of
research labs at universities and the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board's job is to react,'' says Langewiesche. ``To
accidents. The government already has an aviation research branch:
NASA. And it has an aviation regulatory branch: the FAA. These
investigators are not academics. They don't conduct research
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the investigation of the West Palm Beach accident
brings some of those concerns and suggestions into focus.
</P>
<P>
   The Continental engine failure contains no compelling elements
of human drama or mystery, as with TWA 800 and ValuJet 592. The
cause was quickly found.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a senior NTSB official said, ``We were really very
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not hyperbole. Safety board officials avoid speculation
like pilots avoid thunder clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The engine that blew up on Sept. 12 was a General Electric model
CFM56-3, one of more than 4,000 built since the mid-1970s and one
of 2,000 still in use on Boeing 737 aircraft. It suffered an
``uncontained failure'' over West Palm Beach, according to the
NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   Uncontained failure is engineering jargon that means it
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Past uncontained failures have led to chains of events that
brought down airplanes. In the mid-1970s, aircraft companies
estimated the odds of an engine failure leading to loss of control
at more than a billion-to-one. Yet within 12 years, five
uncontained engine failures led to loss of control and four
crashes, including the crash in July 1989 of a United DC-10 that
lost all hydraulic controls. The crash, in Sioux City, Iowa, killed
111 of the 286 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Uncontained engine failure is of particular interest to the
NTSB, said a senior investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Planes are made to fly after an engine loss. They are made to
fly with some damage to the controls, flaps, slats, stabilizer and
rudder, all the systems that keep a plane flying. Back-up systems _
multiple hydraulic lines _ lead to control surfaces so that failure
in one line won't endanger the pilot's ability to fly the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an unpredictable series of events can lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft may be the most complex part of such a sequence, so
complex, says RAND, that the safety board may not be able to figure
out what went wrong when something does: ``When a complex system
fails, the number of potential scenarios rises proportionally.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``The crash of a single airplane, killing hundreds of
passengers, would all but consume the NTSB staff.''
</P>
<P>
   COMPLEX SYSTEMS THEORY QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   Complex systems theory is a current high fashion in academia. At
its core is a thesis _ a belief, really _ that engineers can build
technologies that no single engineer understands, systems so
complex they invite accidents by defying the best efforts of humans
to keep them safe. RAND includes big passenger jets in that
category and cites TWA 800 as an example of the failure of a
complex technology that stumped the safety board.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds reasonable to the layman, but some experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is highly questionable think-tank blather,'' says
Langewiesche. ``Big does not necessarily mean more complex. Modern
jets are simpler from the pilots' standpoint, easier to fly. Flight
data recorders can monitor hundreds of factors in the aircraft. The
mystery of the spark in the fuel tank of TWA 800 was buried in the
fireball, not buried in the engineering of a 747. The lack of a
final answer has nothing to do with so-called complex systems. The
evidence burned.''
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence needed to investigate Continental Flight 1933's
engine failure fell to the ground in chunks, shards and slivers.
The parts gave the safety board an opportunity to take a clean look
at an uncontained failure and recommend changes, if necessary, to
engine maintenance procedures. Enough metal was found to give
General Electric and board investigators their answer.
</P>
<P>
   The parts in question underwent about 48 man-hours of
microscopic examination carried out over two or three weeks,
including a week at GE.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case like this, we look for pre-existing cracks,'' said
Wildey. ``Possible material defects, fractures that can lead to
failure, where they're located, how long they may have been there.
Discoloration can tell us the age of a fracture. We want to put it
all into the right sequence. I think we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The GE engine component that flew apart is called the forward
turbine air seal, a metal alloy disc that keeps high-velocity and
super-heated air from bleeding back from the rear of the engine
into the forward, compressor part of the engine. It is a rotating
part, vs. all those engine parts that are subject to pressures and
stress yet do not spin.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating parts hold special interest for the NTSB. The Sioux
City crash sequence began when a rotating part flew out of the
engine _ an uncontained failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see more regular inspections by the aviation
industry of rotating parts,'' says Bob MacIntosh, 12 years with the
safety board, 22 years with the Air Force and aircraft
manufacturers _ and chief investigator of the Sioux City crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say that only in the context of my role as an
investigator,'' he says. ``More inspections mean more data for me
to analyze. But you could force the industry to go broke by
demanding too many inspections. The industry is safe. Our job is to
make it safer. We start with an accident, not with an idea. We kick
tin, ask questions, get answers. That's how we approach safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The CFM56-3 engine is one of the safest ever built. More than
4,000 have flown more than 82 million hours without a catastrophic
failure. The West Palm Beach incident was the first uncontained
failure of that model in 25 years of operation. The engines have
been subject to hundreds of oil leaks, bird strikes and other
routine glitches over the years, resulting in some engine shutdowns
and unscheduled landings _ but no uncontained failures, according
to Service Difficulty Reports kept by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Because the final safety board report has not been released on
Continental 1933, Wildey and the board won't say what caused the
air seal to fail.
</P>
<P>
   GE did say, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to determine that a crack had developed,'' said
GE spokesman, Rick Kennedy, on Nov. 29. He also said the failure
was a ``random event'' and ``the part had aged badly.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a comment the NTSB may take exception with. Parties to
investigations are prohibited from making probable-cause statements
before the board issues its final report.
</P>
<P>
   And, the turbine seal in question was a ``life-limit'' part,
that is, a part replaced at regular intervals but not necessarily
inspected at regular intervals. Many aircraft systems _ such as
flaps, rivets, controls, electronics _ are inspected regularly and
replaced or repaired when necessary. That leaves a maintenance
trail for investigators to follow, as with the stabilizer on Alaska
Airlines 261.
</P>
<P>
   But GE could deduce the part had aged badly only after it had
fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, GE could make its claims with certainty
because the safety board structures its accident inquiries in a
fashion unique to investigatory agencies: the party system. The
party system brings subjects of NTSB investigations on board as
parties to the investigations, as participants in the
investigation. GE laboratory technicians working at the company's
Cincinnati jet engine plant did much of the research into the
engine failure, under Wildey's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a major crash _ like Alaska Airlines 261 _ the
NTSB will set up as many as 15 working groups, each dedicated to a
facet of the airplane and the overall investigation, including
fuselage, systems, pilots and weather. NTSB group leaders select
experts _ not lawyers or marketing people _ from unions, carriers
and manufacturers to sit on those committees.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY SYSTEM `WORKS, AND WORKS WELL'
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the GE engine failure was focused solely
on the engine. That's why GE engineers examined the engine parts.
They then gave Wildey their version of how and why the explosion
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the party system lets the fox in the chicken
coop, but it works, and works well,'' says Langewiesche. ``The NTSB
is one of the few government agencies that does exactly what it's
supposed to do. It's a saintly agency. They want the facts and
don't care what the legal or public relations fallout might be for
carriers or manufacturers or pilot unions. Sure, the NTSB knows
parties to the investigation have their own agenda. They're not
naive. Does it make sense for GE or Boeing or Pratt to take part in
an investigation of their products? You bet. These are the best
technicians in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildey agrees: ``The NTSB has 400 employees. GE has some
stunning equipment and 400 technicians in that factory alone. We
need their input.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a random event, says GE. That led the company to issue a
service advisory to its customers: When next inspecting CFM56-3
engines, use a more advanced electronic scanning process to look
for imperfections in the forward turbine seal.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines declined to comment when asked whether it
had since inspected the right engine on the plane that departed
from PBIA on Sept. 12, but said the airline operates in strict
compliance with all FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers have up to two years to do the inspection, according to
the GE advisory.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board may recommend a shorter inspection timetable
when its final report is issued.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``probable cause'' statement will be the final word on the
accident, the ``ball game'' for lawyers and manufacturers. When the
board speaks, everybody listens.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA may approve any recommendations made by the safety
board. Eighty-two percent of the agency's recommendations are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   But one word will probably not appear in the final NTSB report:
random.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random implies an event is not connected to anything, out of
the blue,'' said MacIntosh, the senior investigator. ``It's not our
type of word. An event may be rare, but there's always a cause.
Somewhere there's a cause. We find the cause.''

 &HT;    Healthy marriages need constant TLC
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Is your Valentine your spouse? If so, the
following information might enrich or improve your marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Judith S. Wallerstein, Ph.D., co-author of the book ``The Good
Marriage: How and Why Love Lasts,'' listed nine components for a
healthy marriage:
</P>
<P>
   _ The couple is able to separate emotionally from their family
of origin to invest fully in their marriage. This necessitates
redefining commitments and communication patterns with the family
of one's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Developing togetherness, which includes sharing interests,
values, dreams for the future, etc. This togetherness is based on
mutual identification and shared intimacy, but does not exclude the
need for each partner to set boundaries to protect each other's
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Development of a healthy sexual relationship, which requires
protection from intrusion, such as other family commitments and
work-related issues. Couples display care and effort in their
physical appearance, strive for mutually pleasurable activities and
endeavor to please one another.
</P>
<P>
   _ If and when children arrive in the marriage, protecting and
preserving the relationship by absorbing the impact of the baby's
entrance into the marriage in a healthy way. Pre-planning and
flexible thinking can make this work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Developing strategies to deal with inevitable crises that
arise. Death, financial problems, career changes and illness are
all examples of issues that require extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maintaining the strength of the marital relationship in the
face of adversity. Partners must have the ability to express
differences, conflict and anger without destroying the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using humor to keep a healthy perspective and avoid boredom.
Humor can help smooth out a lot of rough times in a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing empathy, validation and comfort in a nurturing
environment that offers continuing encouragement and support. Being
best friends really helps with these tasks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, striving to keep the romantic spark alive that
characterizes the early years of marriage. The little things
(flowers, love notes, special ``I love you'' surprises) can all
help in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Wallerstein emphasizes that for the marriage to be happy and
complete, these nine elements need to be a natural, ongoing and
interrelated set of variables rather than a ``checklist'' assigned
to the marriage from outside the marital relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Valentine's Day on this first Valentine's Day of the new
century.
</P>

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Vultures congregated to feed on a deer carcass in the woods
near our house. One large, prehistoric-looking bird perched on the
porch railing and eyed our cat. It easily could have attacked the
cat, so I scared the bird off. Now I'm uncomfortable letting the
cat out. Do vultures pose a hazard to small pets? _ M.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: They are not really a threat to household domestic animals,
says Chris Shackelford of the Texas Parks and Wildlife. Vultures
are carrion eaters (they clean up our land of dead animals). It is
pretty impressive that vultures can consume rotting meat with no
ill effect. If the vultures were very hungry, a wounded living
animal or very defenseless one (a newborn gerbil, for example)
might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you identify the narrator of the movie ``My Dog Skip''? I
watched the credits, but I must have missed it _ it sounds like
Bruce Willis. _Pat A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like Bruce Willis, but it's not. The crooning tone
belongs to musician and actor Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When my father-in-law was in town recently, he noticed that
on some Texas license plates the flag was on the left side, on
others the right side of the plate and on others there was not a
flag at all. We thought you might be able to help clear up this
mystery. _David Triplett
</P>
<P>
   A: Plates issued before December 1998 have the flag on the left
and sport letter, letter, letter, number, number, letter. When this
series was exhausted, ``we converted to a new alphanumeric scheme,
which is letter, number, number, letter, letter, letter and shifted
the flag to the right,'' says Texas Department of Transportation's
Mike Viesca. The not-so-popular plates celebrating 150 years of
statehood do not have a Lone Star flag at all. Q: Are you supposed
to acknowledge sympathy cards? _M.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Personal letters along with flowers, donations or other
assistance should be recognized with a handwritten note. No one
expects the acknowledgement to be timely or lengthy. If the
condolence card was printed, adds the doyenne of etiquette, Emily
Post, with no personal message added, you are not obliged to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently moved into a house with sliding glass doors as
the only source of access to our back yard. With a dog alone inside
our home all day, and no standard wood door in which to install a
dog door, we are in a bind! I have been running home on my lunch
break, but I can't keep this up forever. Is there such thing as a
dog door that attaches to a sliding glass door? _G.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep. These glass panels come in small, medium, large and
extra large. Order one through Bark N Purr, 4604 Burnet Road, and
your pooch will enjoy new freedom in a couple of days. Armchair
shopper? Order from Pet Expo at (888) PET EXPO or online from Pet
Doors at dogdoors.com. Be prepared to pay more than $100, but the
lunchtime freedom will be well worth it.Q: My husband never washes
chicken before cooking. He unpacks it from the containers and
throws it straight into a pot or marinates and grills it. I can
hardly stand that. He says the cooking will kill whatever's on it.
Can you ask your experts their opinion on the matter? (The funny
thing is, he is totally paranoid about uncooked chicken touching
anything in the kitchen!)
</P>
<P>
   _ Margarita F.
</P>
<P>
   A: The ultimate poultry source is the USDA Meat and Poultry
Hotline at (800) 535-4555. To wash or not to wash? The hotline
experts said it does not make any difference from a health
standpoint. Caveats? The chicken must be in its original wrap and
fresh (no more than two or three days in the refrigerator) and
never been left more than two hours at room temperature. Q:
Recently, I paid a station clerk inside for my gasoline, but when
my bill arrived, a $50 charge in addition to the gas price had been
added to my bill. Can this happen when a credit card is used at the
pump instead of paying inside? _ Robbie L.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to CreditComm, gas stations do not have access to
card numbers or expiration dates when a card is used at the pump
(wait for your receipt). When a credit card is used inside a
station, the information is available to the clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The negative about a card at a pump? No way to verify you are
the card's owner. Inside? The account number could be accessed.
Bottom line? Keep track of your card, read your statements and
immediately challenge any discrepancies
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several times a year blue wasps seem to hatch, and for a
couple of weeks I kill six to 10 per day, usually around bathroom
lights and a window in the master bedroom. I have searched for
their nest but cannot find it. I have sealed all noticeable cracks,
bathroom vents and have added screens at the heat/air conditioning
vents. All to no avail. Pest exterminators have nothing to offer.
How can I get rid of these pests?
</P>
<P>
   _ David Waugh
</P>
<P>
   A: These are probably not wasps but dirt daubers _ beneficial
because they eat spiders and other insects (yum, yum). Daubers make
long cigar-shaped nests. They are probably in the crevices of the
attic rafters, says bee and wasp remover Al Kinser. Hardware cloth
does not keep them from getting in and nesting in odd holes. Check
the tops of recessed lights and attic vent holes. Remove the nests
with a paint scraper (nests contain dead spiders and eggs only).
You may have to do this several times until they get the idea to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Turns out Valentine's Day is not just about lovebirds. The
``Giant Book of Superstitions'' notes the first bird you see on
this day of love portends your future mate. Check out these birds
and prophecies. See a blackbird, marry a member of the clergy;
goldfinch, marry a millionaire; yellowbird, marry a reasonably rich
spouse; a bluebird, poverty; a sparrow, love in a cottage; a
redbreast, marry a sailor; and a flock of doves, good luck in
marriage.

 &HT;    Locals' thoughts on presidential primary
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's business as usual this morning at the
local cafe. My retired farmer buddies are talking politics over
their first cup of decaf. As is also usual, nobody's agreeing on
anything other than they'd all sooner vote for Tiny Hodelman than
for Al Gore or ``Little George.'' ``If the rest of Ohio feels the
way you guys do,'' I warn them, ``the upcoming primary is going to
knock the pollsters for a loop...and who's Tiny Hodelman?''
</P>
<P>
   Amos has to laugh just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiny was an okay guy,'' he says, ``just not real blessed in
the brains department. Once he loaded a couple of pigs in the back
of his pickup and headed for the fairgrounds. Then he got to
thinking about how dirty the pigs were and how much better they'd
look clean, so he drove 'em through the carwash. The pigs came out
clean but scared. They wouldn't quit squealing and Tiny had to
drive 'em back home so they'd shut up. Missed the whole fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Benny says we can't vote for Tiny anyway because he's been dead
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   I tell him that shouldn't make much difference. Back where I
lived in Georgia, dead folks voted all the time. Whenever a liquor
referendum came up, they crawled out of the cemeteries to vote it
down. If dead folks can vote,
</P>
<P>
   they sure ought to be able to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   Cal brings up the Reform party and chuckles. Says there isn't
much left of it since they had that brawl in Nashville and dumped
their chairman. Amos asks where he thinks that leaves Ventura and
Trump, and Cal's answer is: OUT! he hopes. ``Guys like that make us
look sillier than we already are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think'd happen if Trump got elected?'' Cal
asks. We can't guess, so he tells us. ``First thing he'd probably
do is mortgage the whole dang country to finance some real estate
scheme. Then he'd lose us in the next
</P>
<P>
   market slump and that'd leave the country up for grabs. We'd
probably end up the property of some third-world country that can't
even keep the buses running on time.''
</P>
<P>
   While we're thinking that one over, Benny tells us how he was
never against the notion of Trump running, but thought he ought to
get married first because it just wouldn't be dignified for our
country to have a ``Model of the Week'' instead of a First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder out loud how anybody in his right mind would consider
forking over tax money to a guy who brags about being $900 million
in debt and sells $100,000 memberships in his vacation home
(Mar-a-Lago, formerly Marjorie
</P>
<P>
   Merriweather Post's Palm Beach castle) to keep his creditors
from foreclosing. No way this guy could make it on a measly
$400,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   What does bother Benny though is Hillary in New York. Amos
reminds him she's running for the Senate, not for President.
</P>
<P>
   Benny storks his neck out at us and jabs an index finger on the
table a few times just to make sure we're paying attention. ``Oh
yeah. That's this year. Give her time. She wants Bill's old job -
wants to rub his nose in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal whispers something to Amos and they both cackle. When I ask
what's so funny they brush me off saying it's an Oval office thing.
I tell them their smutty geezer minds are working overtime. They
tell me they like it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Amos says McCain's okay with him, both of them being veterans.
Benny kind of likes Bradley, and Cal says he's real sorry Forbes
dropped out because, ``He was the only guy running who wasn't any
better looking than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it, folks. It may not be official, but
believe me, this is how elections are made. Forget the polls and
get over the hype. New Hampshire and South Carolina mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, California, and New York? They're up for grabs,
but come March 7, Super Tuesday, I can tell you how Ohio will be
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for Tiny Hodelman!
</P>

 &HT;    But officer, I only dabbed it behind my ears
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg

   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's a flashlight! It's a breath analyzer! It's
annoying! It's the cops' newest weapon, the P.A.S. III! The P.A.S.
III, otherwise known as ``the sniffer,'' is a flashlight that
registers alcohol on the breath of whomever the light is pointed
at. It also can detect if anyone in a car has been drinking. It's
not annoying for what it does. We totally condone getting all the
drunks off the road. The P.A.S. III irks because it already has a
strong track record of false positives. Police in Richardson,
Texas, have reported positive results from people with mouthwash on
their breath and from people wearing strong cologne or perfume.
While the Austin Police Department won't confirm or deny it is
using the P.A.S. III, let this be a warning to Listerine users
driving around on the weekend.

 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Rockstar Games is back, and the winter lineup of Playstation
games totally kicks. To start, Grand Theft Auto has
beenreincarnated as GTA2 ($50; www.gta2.com). If you played the
controversial first one, you know the drill. You play a criminal
intent on stealing cars and killing people. In the sequel, the
purpose is to endear yourself to one of three street gangs by
``offing'' members of other street gangs and doing ``errands.'' You
perform these tasks to a rocking soundtrack and smooth game play.
This overhead driver/shooter game is irreverent and violent, but
it's totally fun and worth the flak you might get from an
anti-violence group. Rockstar's other title is Thrasher: Skate and
Destroy ($50; www.skateanddestroy.com). This skating game is good
enough to brandish the name of Thrasher, the ultimate skater's mag.
In the game, you are an up and comer armed only with a skateboard
and a couple of tricks. Through the levels, you join competitions
and kickflip, nollie and tailgrab your way into other competitions
and sponsorships. This game is addictive and will make you set
aside Activision's ``Tony Hawk: Pro Skater.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's only fair to judge a game by what it hopes to accomplish,
so criticizing Slave Zero (Infogrames, $30) for a lack of depth
would be like criticizing Pokemon for being unrealistic. That's the
point. Zero is about living the universal childhood temper-tantrum
fantasy of being an invincible 100-foot-tall monster who stomps
mightily through an endless cityscape, crushing and smashing
anything in its way. In Zero, you're a rampaging robot with a
mission. Cars on endless interstates swerve to avoid you or smash
into 20-car pileups as tiny frightened citizens scream and cower or
run. Helicopters and buildings are shattered with one blow from
your mighty fist or a blast from your rocket launcher. On the
downside, too few weapons options, an initially confusing control
setup and maddening ammunition shortages slow the game needlessly.
And it has no multiplayer option. But once you get up to speed, the
anime-style hero, fluid movement, beautiful cityscape and furious
pace add up to tons and tons of rampaging excitement. Which is all
``Slave Zero'' ever wanted. Stomp on with your bad self.

 &HT;    Simon &AMP; Schuster encyclopedia both helpful and hard to use
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are things to like about the Simon &AMP;
Schuster New Millennium Children's Encyclopedia and Home Reference
Library (Deluxe 2000 Edition; $21; www.simonandschuster.com), but
its giggly rainbow of typography and ``For Ages 8-12 Years'' on the
cover belie its hard-to-fathom interface and a dizzying array of
options that will daunt most adults and overwhelm its target
audience. The program lets the user download books and updates from
the Internet (at additional cost), organize content in dozens of
ways or study books in several languages, among many customizing
tools. Other pluses include a built-in dictionary, atlas, animal
encyclopedia and book of world cultures, all well-illustrated. But
even the handy voice-over tour of scrollbars and options can't hide
the giant learning curve required to master the interface. The
articles are written in clear, kid-friendly language and
accompanied by a fairly generous selection of illustrations, short
films and audio recordings. It's not a bad tool for kids' research
projects, but the bottom line is that without the dedicated
supervision of a librarian or other adult, this complex program
will probably just drive most children bonkers.

 &HT;    Super sci-fi fare, and shedding a little light on the subject
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every now and then you run across a piece of
science fiction that ascends the piles of books about aliens and
space travel, stands atop and calls attention to itself. Charles
Clotfelter's We Aquatus ($27, www. area51pub.com) is such a book.
Clotfelter is a taxi driver in Las Vegas and an author on the side.
His book details a race of aliens who have been living on Earth for
thousands of years and have recently decided to announce
themselves. The book, which blends philosophy and history into a
seamless tome, is fresh, lively and thought-provoking. Especially
satisfying is the exciting denouement. This is a great fireside,
weekend read for these few days of winter we experience in Austin.
And to help you see your books while reading by the fire, might I
suggest the newest in book lights. The Fliplite Junior ($10, www.
BarnesandNoble.com) is a compact, folding book light you can take
just about anywhere. The light clips onto the back of the book and
works well with hardbacks and paperbacks. You'll also look
up-to-the-minute when you use the light: It comes in a fashionable
salmon color with a yellow plastic cover for the light.

 &HT;    Web team gets whiff of future
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It won't be long before your computer is
stinking up the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The iSmell _ no kidding, that's its name _ is a boxy gizmo that
looks like a pencil sharpener and attaches to your computer like a
printer. Inside is a tray of scent materials, called a scent
palate, that can produce thousands of smells on command.
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll soon be able to tool the information
superhighway and stop and smell the roses, say Joel Bellenson and
Dexster Smith, founders of Oakland, Fla.-based DigiScents and
makers of the iSmell.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson and Smith predict an entire e-world teeming with
scents: Smelly Web sites and e-mail, stinky movies, music and
advertising, and some really rank games. According to Scentworld,
DigiScents online guide to the world of smells, playing a
shoot-em-up might soon include an experience like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel helpless, and then it hits you ... a slight stream of
warm air, saturated with the stench of death and decay, drifts into
your nostrils.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson said racing games could use the smells of the terrain
and the vehicles to help pull users into the experience; adventure
games could use smell cues to tip a player off that a creature has
entered the room, and Web sites and e-mail could include just about
any smells you care _ or fear _ to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Movies could use smell the way they currently use soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding scent to movies will be like adding color to movies,''
Bellenson said, and despite the failure of the cruder attempts of
Smell-O-Vision, Bellenson is sure DigiScents will succeed. ``The
first movie with sound was `Jazz Singer' and it was basically a
piece of crap that people hated, but that didn't doom sound in
movies.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's a flashlight! It's a breath analyzer! It's
annoying! It's the cops' newest weapon, the P.A.S. III! The P.A.S.
III, otherwise known as ``the sniffer,'' is a flashlight that
registers alcohol on the breath of whomever the light is pointed
at. It also can detect if anyone in a car has been drinking. It's
not annoying for what it does. We totally condone getting all the
drunks off the road. The P.A.S. III irks because it already has a
strong track record of false positives. Police in Richardson,
Texas, have reported positive results from people with mouthwash on
their breath and from people wearing strong cologne or perfume.
While the Austin Police Department won't confirm or deny it is
using the P.A.S. III, let this be a warning to Listerine users
driving around on the weekend.

 &HT;    Super sci-fi fare, and shedding a little light on the subject
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every now and then you run across a piece of
science fiction that ascends the piles of books about aliens and
space travel, stands atop and calls attention to itself. Charles
Clotfelter's We Aquatus ($27, www. area51pub.com) is such a book.
Clotfelter is a taxi driver in Las Vegas and an author on the side.
His book details a race of aliens who have been living on Earth for
thousands of years and have recently decided to announce
themselves. The book, which blends philosophy and history into a
seamless tome, is fresh, lively and thought-provoking. Especially
satisfying is the exciting denouement. This is a great fireside,
weekend read for these few days of winter we experience in Austin.
And to help you see your books while reading by the fire, might I
suggest the newest in book lights. The Fliplite Junior ($10, www.
BarnesandNoble.com) is a compact, folding book light you can take
just about anywhere. The light clips onto the back of the book and
works well with hardbacks and paperbacks. You'll also look
up-to-the-minute when you use the light: It comes in a fashionable
salmon color with a yellow plastic cover for the light.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Rockstar Games is back, and the winter lineup of Playstation
games totally kicks. To start, Grand Theft Auto has
beenreincarnated as GTA2 ($50; www.gta2.com). If you played the
controversial first one, you know the drill. You play a criminal
intent on stealing cars and killing people. In the sequel, the
purpose is to endear yourself to one of three street gangs by
``offing'' members of other street gangs and doing ``errands.'' You
perform these tasks to a rocking soundtrack and smooth game play.
This overhead driver/shooter game is irreverent and violent, but
it's totally fun and worth the flak you might get from an
anti-violence group. Rockstar's other title is Thrasher: Skate and
Destroy ($50; www.skateanddestroy.com). This skating game is good
enough to brandish the name of Thrasher, the ultimate skater's mag.
In the game, you are an up and comer armed only with a skateboard
and a couple of tricks. Through the levels, you join competitions
and kickflip, nollie and tailgrab your way into other competitions
and sponsorships. This game is addictive and will make you set
aside Activision's ``Tony Hawk: Pro Skater.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's only fair to judge a game by what it hopes to accomplish,
so criticizing Slave Zero (Infogrames, $30) for a lack of depth
would be like criticizing Pokemon for being unrealistic. That's the
point. Zero is about living the universal childhood temper-tantrum
fantasy of being an invincible 100-foot-tall monster who stomps
mightily through an endless cityscape, crushing and smashing
anything in its way. In Zero, you're a rampaging robot with a
mission. Cars on endless interstates swerve to avoid you or smash
into 20-car pileups as tiny frightened citizens scream and cower or
run. Helicopters and buildings are shattered with one blow from
your mighty fist or a blast from your rocket launcher. On the
downside, too few weapons options, an initially confusing control
setup and maddening ammunition shortages slow the game needlessly.
And it has no multiplayer option. But once you get up to speed, the
anime-style hero, fluid movement, beautiful cityscape and furious
pace add up to tons and tons of rampaging excitement. Which is all
``Slave Zero'' ever wanted. Stomp on with your bad self.

 &HT;    Web team gets whiff of future
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It won't be long before your computer is
stinking up the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The iSmell _ no kidding, that's its name _ is a boxy gizmo that
looks like a pencil sharpener and attaches to your computer like a
printer. Inside is a tray of scent materials, called a scent
palate, that can produce thousands of smells on command.
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll soon be able to tool the information
superhighway and stop and smell the roses, say Joel Bellenson and
Dexster Smith, founders of Oakland, Fla.-based DigiScents and
makers of the iSmell.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson and Smith predict an entire e-world teeming with
scents: Smelly Web sites and e-mail, stinky movies, music and
advertising, and some really rank games. According to Scentworld,
DigiScents online guide to the world of smells, playing a
shoot-em-up might soon include an experience like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel helpless, and then it hits you ... a slight stream of
warm air, saturated with the stench of death and decay, drifts into
your nostrils.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson said racing games could use the smells of the terrain
and the vehicles to help pull users into the experience; adventure
games could use smell cues to tip a player off that a creature has
entered the room, and Web sites and e-mail could include just about
any smells you care _ or fear _ to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Movies could use smell the way they currently use soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding scent to movies will be like adding color to movies,''
Bellenson said, and despite the failure of the cruder attempts of
Smell-O-Vision, Bellenson is sure DigiScents will succeed. ``The
first movie with sound was `Jazz Singer' and it was basically a
piece of crap that people hated, but that didn't doom sound in
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Bellenson and Smith founded Pangea Systems, Inc., a
tremendously successful biotech company that is working to unravel
the mysteries of DNA. They left early retirement to found
DigiScents in February 1999. When they discovered a way to digitize
and transmit the ``language of smell'' through a computer, the
iSmell was born. The company plans to start testing it by early
spring and have it on store shelves by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson said the company is also developing software that will
allow scentographers to create smell-laden art and invent their own
scents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope our tools will give rise to a large body of people who
will try to be creative,'' he said. ``I'm sure there will be
legions of young people trying to create their own scent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the whole world might soon smell like teen spirit.

 &HT;    Simon &AMP; Schuster encyclopedia both helpful and hard to use
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are things to like about the Simon &AMP;
Schuster New Millennium Children's Encyclopedia and Home Reference
Library (Deluxe 2000 Edition; $21; www.simonandschuster.com), but
its giggly rainbow of typography and ``For Ages 8-12 Years'' on the
cover belie its hard-to-fathom interface and a dizzying array of
options that will daunt most adults and overwhelm its target
audience. The program lets the user download books and updates from
the Internet (at additional cost), organize content in dozens of
ways or study books in several languages, among many customizing
tools. Other pluses include a built-in dictionary, atlas, animal
encyclopedia and book of world cultures, all well-illustrated. But
even the handy voice-over tour of scrollbars and options can't hide
the giant learning curve required to master the interface. The
articles are written in clear, kid-friendly language and
accompanied by a fairly generous selection of illustrations, short
films and audio recordings. It's not a bad tool for kids' research
projects, but the bottom line is that without the dedicated
supervision of a librarian or other adult, this complex program
will probably just drive most children bonkers.

LIFE WITH ONE KIDNEY

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Karee White, standing up to turn off the television before
bed one night was the beginning of months of fear.
</P>
<P>
   The Lee's Summit, Mo., resident felt nausea and chest pain so
intense she thought she was having a heart attack. Much to her
relief, doctors at the hospital told her it was only a stress
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, White felt the same pain. Thinking it was
another stress attack, she just stayed home this time. But the pain
continued into the next day.
</P>
<P>
   After friends speculated she might have gallbladder problems,
White called the doctor and set up an ultrasound. Her friends were
partly right. White did need her gallbladder removed.
</P>
<P>
   She also needed her kidney removed.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had discovered a malignant tumor on her kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Last week film director Steven Spielberg also had a kidney
removed. Though his doctors would say only that they discovered an
``irregularity'' on the kidney, other doctors have speculated that
the most likely reason for Spielberg's kidney removal, also called
a nephrectomy, was a mass on the organ. Masses, often cancerous,
are the most common cause for removal, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time a kidney is removed because they find a spot
on the kidney or an abnormal mass on a kidney X-ray,'' said Kirk
Duncan, a Kansas City area nephrologist. ``The concern is that it
could possibly represent a tumor or a malignancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys also can be removed due to serious infections, abscesses
or accidents that damage the kidney, doctors say. When both kidneys
stop functioning, dialysis or transplantation usually is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the kidney is needed to clear the body of waste, people
can live normally with less than one kidney. The remaining kidney
usually enlarges and picks up much of the work load. Typically, the
remaining kidney works hard enough to achieve about 80 percent of
the functioning of two normal kidneys, Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the body still can function with about one-third of one
kidney, said J. Brantley Thrasher, chief of urology at the
University of Kansas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors do recommend, however, that people who have a kidney
removed make a few changes in their lives. Because they don't have
a kidney on reserve, they must be extra careful.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors advise that those with only one kidney drink lots
of fluids to prevent kidney stones, decrease their protein
consumption and monitor their blood pressure. They also warn that
contact sports can lead to kidney damage and possible need for
removal.
</P>
<P>
   Kidney problems come as a surprise to most people. Noticeable
symptoms include blood in the urine, difficulty urinating, more
frequent urination _ especially at night _ and pain in the back,
according to Teresa Pavia, health information manager for the
National Kidney Foundation in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But many times a kidney problem goes unnoticed. Problems often
are detected by doctors during a routine physical exam (as was the
case with Spielberg) or through an X-ray or other tests done to
examine an unrelated concern.
</P>
<P>
   Of the masses detected on kidneys, about 90 percent are
cancerous, said Thrasher, a urologic oncologist. Because the
symptoms often are unnoticeable he calls kidney cancer ``a silent
killer.'' The American Cancer Society estimates that this year
there will be 31,200 new kidney and renal pelvis cancer cases
diagnosed. And 11,900 people are expected to die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, Thrasher said, is that the causes of kidney cancer
are unknown. But some studies have listed family history of cancer
and exposure to cigarette smoking, cigars and pipes as risk
factors. In addition, radiation and chemotherapy don't kill kidney
cancer, he said. The most effective cure is to remove part or all
of the kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgical therapy early is the best chance for a long-term
cure,'' Thrasher said. ``Once it spreads outside the kidney, it's
very difficult to cure and long-term survival is rare.''
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer does spread outside the kidney, it spreads to the
lungs 55 percent to 60 percent of the time, to the bone or
lymphnodes about 30 percent of the time, and to the brain about 10
percent of the time, Thrasher said.
</P>
<P>
   White, who had her kidney removed by Thrasher last November,
lives daily with the fear the cancer will return. After her
surgery, doctors told her they had removed all the cancer, but she
still has to go for checkups every six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that they said they got it all, but there's a big
doubt there,'' said the 33-year-old White, personnel manager at a
Lee's Summit Hy-Vee.
</P>
<P>
   White said she's trying to forget about the surgery, but the
emotions are hard to escape. She remembers clearly the day the
doctor told her she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first meeting, he told me it was malignant,'' White
said. ``And I said, `That's the good kind?' And he said `No.' So I
freaked out. I thought instantaneously I was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   White said she became an emotional recluse after learning she
had a cancerous tumor. She remembered the pain her parents went
through when her grandmother died of cancer about 13 years ago, and
she didn't want them to have to go through that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept praying,'' she said. ``I just wanted to live. I
thought, `I'll go through any anguish between now and the surgery
as long as I can live.' It just wasn't time for me to die. I just
wanted to let everyone know what they meant to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the surgery, White feels healthy physically,
but mentally she has changed. She is more careful to tell family
and friends what they mean to her and she doesn't worry about ``all
the stupid little things'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Lolita White (no relation to Karee) was also startled when
doctors told her she had cancer. White, of Kansas City, Kan., was
having tests done to examine a hormone problem when doctors found a
malignant mass on her kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just kind of surprised,'' said White, now 78. ``I never
thought of myself as having cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   But White began to research her family medical history and
discovered cancer ran in her family. Knowing she didn't have
another choice, White had her kidney removed in January.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery has made her a little weak, but White said she's
working hard in physical therapy to regain her strength. She's
staying with her son Marcellus Hughes while she recuperates and has
taken up the card game solitaire to keep her busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this age, each day is a blessing,'' she said.

THIS TERMITE COULD BE HEADED YOUR WAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   If termites come chewing at your doorframes this year, just
thank your lucky stars they aren't Formosan termites.
</P>
<P>
   You know about killer bees, but have you heard about this
hyperactive brand of wood munchers?
</P>
<P>
   An ecologist, writing in an issue of the ``Bulletin of the Royal
Entomological Society,'' recently labeled the Formosan termite the
``most important'' structural pest of the new millennium _ as if
you needed one.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, ``important'' means ``bad.'' Formosan termites are
eating their way up and down the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida.
They've made tracks into Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and
California, said Mark Hunter, an ecologist and associate professor
at the University of Georgia in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   While they currently are going gangbusters mostly in moist
climates, Formosan termites could theoretically survive farther
north, including Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the worry?
</P>
<P>
   Formosan termites have several endearing characteristics. They
are champions at adaptation _ they can use the condensation around
a pipe as a water source rather than the soil _ and they create
enormous colonies. Eradicating them is a serious challenge.
Chemical barriers in the soil are no match.
</P>
<P>
   ``This termite can set up house in your attic,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   While most termites feed on dead trees and wood, Formosan
termites will attack living plants. About 30 percent of the famed
live oak trees around New Orleans are infested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry is that they will attack other hosts and perhaps
even crop plants,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Already the United States is spending $1 billion a year trying
to control Formosan termites and prevent their spread. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture is engaged in a major research project to
rein in the species.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that they haven't staked a claim to Missouri or
Kansas _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness,'' said Steve Ashe, entomology professor at the
University of Kansas. ``They're really aggressive. They have such
huge colonies they can render a house virtually unlivable in just a
few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Formosan termites have been in the United States at least since
the 1960s, by way of Asia and the Pacific islands. Humans are
responsible for their introduction here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get transported around when people move wood,'' Ashe
said. ``Apparently old railroad ties are good for transporting
these termites.''

 &HT;    'A roar, woo-woo-woo,' then disaster in Southwest Georgia
 &HT;    WITH STORMS-GEORGIA
 &HT;    FOR MONDAY PMs
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    and Mike Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Vox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terrified residents described deafening thunder, continuous
lightning that lit the sky and roaring winds as tornadoes swept
through Southwest Georgia shortly after midnight, killing at least
12 people.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest hit area was in Mitchell County, south of Albany,
where a twister cut a five-mile path through a residential area of
mostly mobile homes about 12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary,'' said Ron Gilliard, Mitchell County
hospital administrator, whose home was damaged shortly after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliard, his parents, his brother and a cousin live in an area
south of Camilla devastated by the tornados. ``My wife and I ran to
the bathroom, held each other and prayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliard said his first cousin suffered lacerations when his
mobile home was destroyed. ``It was in a pecan grove, where every
tree was uprooted,'' he said. ``He was bleeding profusely. I put
him in my car and drove him to the hospital. It took us 45 minutes
to go the three miles because of downed trees and power lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The small, 33-bed hospital quickly became ``a war zone,'' he
said, as more than 120 injured people poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallway was lined with patients; we took mattresses off
older beds and put them on the floor; we had patients in chairs, on
cots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what hospitals do; we triaged the most seriously
injured first,'' he said. ``My entire medical staff responded,
including off-duty people, and a lot of our folks have damaged
homes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Trees were blown down, a brick house was lifted off its
foundation and witnesses said a tractor-trailer was flipped on its
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you heard was a roar, woo-woo-woo,'' said Johnny Jones,
whose mobile home about two miles south of Camilla was lifted by
winds and landed on its side.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was able to free his 14-year-old son, who was
pinned under a washing machine, and they crawled out a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could see was that everything was demolished. People
were hollering and crying 'Where's my child?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He took four of his neighbors to the hospital in his car. ``They
were skinned up, cut up and one guy got his leg broke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like somebody took a bulldozer and leveled it,'' said
Mikie Newsome, a volunteer firefighter who rushed to the scene to
help search through the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his father watched as lightning lit the sky and a
large dark funnel cloud dipped down about three miles from their
house.
</P>
<P>
   Perlist Wallace, 38, lives about a block from the devastated
area. ``I saw trees on top of house trailers. Everything was just
torn apart,'' he said.

BEN THERE, DONE THAT: BEN AFFLECK ON FILMS, FAME AND `REINDEER
GAMES'

entertainment package.)

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Ben Affleck with Charlize Theron in a
scene from ``Reindeer Games.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Ben Affleck's beefcake photos had been carefully clipped out and
taped onto the wall, occupying a place of honor above Matt Damon
and below Leonardo DiCaprio.
 &HT;    Somehow, though, Affleck wasn't pleased.
 &HT;    The actor wasn't visiting the bedroom of some teen-age fan,
after all, but touring the cells in a maximum-security Canadian
prison, researching his role as a convict in his latest film, John
Frankenheimer's ``Reindeer Games.''
 &HT;    ``Let's just say that, going through a cellblock, I began to
regret every single hunky pose,'' Affleck says with a laugh. ``I
couldn't believe it when I saw my cover of GQ up on a few walls.
 &HT;    ``I kept thinking about how my friend Matt Damon wore that green
Speedo in `The Talented Mr. Ripley' _ I thought, `If the positions
were reversed, he'd be in real trouble!'''
 &HT;    He'd planned to spend the night in the prison, the better to
grasp a convict's point of view, but he changed his mind.
 &HT;    ``The warden called me over and said, `Ben, a lot of these guys
really liked you in ``Good Will Hunting.'' We're worried that, if
you stay over, you might be taken hostage,''' he recalls. ``I said,
`Yes, thank you, I'll be sleeping at home.'''
 &HT;    Relaxing in a gray sweater and blue jeans for an interview at
Manhattan's Essex House, Affleck is a long way from the hoosegow,
but he says it doesn't seem all that far.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' he says, ``when I was in jail, most of the inmates
had two questions, `Did you sleep with Liv Tyler during
``Armageddon?'' Are you still dating Gwyneth?'''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``You know, prisoners and celebrity journalists have a lot in
common!''
 &HT;    Affleck has never been hotter, with two films about to be
released: ``Boiler Room,'' which will open on Feb. 18, casts him as
a fast-talking corporate recruiter at a shady stockbrokerage, while
he stars in ``Reindeer Games,'' due a week later, as an ex-convict
who, in a case of mistaken identity, is taken hostage by a band of
thugs.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have work,'' he says. ``But the real question you want
to ask is, `Are you happy, Ben?'''
 &HT;    Actually, he says, that depends.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm lucky,'' he concedes, ``but I'm not always happy.
As far as fame and fortune go, I generally believe one should
understand that none of it is deserved.
 &HT;    ``Look, the phone has stopped ringing for better actors than
me.''
 &HT;    Even after he and Damon won a screenwriting Oscar for ``Good
Will Hunting'' (1997), Affleck says, things still didn't sit right
with him.
 &HT;    ``I've found it difficult to enjoy success,'' Affleck admits.
``It's strange, because when you're a young, struggling actor you
have to convince yourself that someday, when you get to the point
where you have money and roles, you'll relax and be happy.
 &HT;    ``But I've got those things,'' he says, ``and now I've found out
something depressing: The struggle is more satisfying than getting
what you want _ it's the struggle that makes you happy.''
 &HT;    For now, the struggle is definitely over. Affleck is not only in
demand with top directors and producers, but he's a certifiable
Hollywood hunk _ a status not likely to be diminished by ``Reindeer
Games,'' in which he shares an explicit sex scene with co-star
Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    ``I did not use a butt double,'' the actor swears. ``That's a
point of pride with me _ it will always be my own butt. Although I
do have a flat a--. It was one time when an actor was glad the
camera puts on 10 pounds.''
 &HT;    Affleck began acting at an early age, as a child growing up in
Central Square, the non-affluent part of Cambridge, Mass. His
parents divorced when he was a small boy, and for support he turned
to his best friend, Matt, who lived a block away.
 &HT;    Though Affleck was the first to get an agent and find work on
PBS and in local television, his agent eventually signed Damon as
well. Soon the two high-school students were taking the train to
auditions in New York.
 &HT;    For a while, things didn't go well. Affleck landed small roles
in ``School Ties'' (1992) and ``Dazed and Confused'' (1993), but
college stints in Vermont and California led nowhere and, after
breaking up with his girlfriend, he found himself homeless.
 &HT;    He headed for Los Angeles, where he crashed with Damon in a
small, two-bedroom house they shared with another friend. In their
spare time, they wrote ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997) _ and the rest
is history.
 &HT;    But not history Hollywood-style, Affleck insists.
 &HT;    ``I can't imagine myself getting to the point where I'm saying
things like, `This bleeping limo had better be a stretch!''' he
says, laughing. ``In fact, Matt and I are constantly saying, `Let's
scale things down.'
 &HT;    ``We look at each other and say, `Man, I don't care if it's a
limo _ I'm just glad I have a ride.'''
 &HT;    It's sometimes been a bumpy ride, though, especially when it
comes to his private life. All a woman has to do is say hello to
him, it seems, to start the tabloid rumors swirling.
 &HT;    ``I swear there is some guy in L.A. who looks like me,'' Affleck
says. ``And he's dating all these beautiful women.''
 &HT;    The most prominent beautiful woman in his life is Gwyneth
Paltrow, the on-again/off-again girlfriend about whom Affleck will
say nothing more than ``she's a wonderful actress'' and ``we're
very close.''
 &HT;    That may be an understatement, according to ``Reindeer Games''
co-star Clarence Williams III.
 &HT;    ``Ben's lady Gwyneth flew in to see him all the time on the
set,'' Williams says in a separate interview. ``They would be
standing in the snow and tundra, holding hands. People would gasp,
because it was like the Golden Couple had arrived.
 &HT;    ``Standing there were two Oscar winners,'' he adds. ``They're
gorgeous. They have lots of money and fame. You almost wanted to
bow to them!''
 &HT;    The speculation is bound to continue, because Affleck's next
movie is ``Bounce,'' a love story about survivors of a plane crash
due to open this summer. His co-star: Paltrow.
 &HT;    Plane crash notwithstanding, Affleck says that the worst part of
the shoot was the makeup: Because he spends much of the movie
shirtless, he had to have extensive work done to cover the multiple
tattoos that are souvenirs of his restless youth.
 &HT;    ``They have this huge, flesh-colored spray paint,'' he says.
``You just stand there, and they sandblast you for 10 minutes. The
tattoo thing was a good lesson in decisions that have long-lasting
repercussions!''
 &HT;    ``Long-lasting'' is actually a key word for Affleck, who aspires
to a long career.
 &HT;    ``I don't think you've really made it until you can say you've
had career longevity,'' he says. ``I want decades.''
 &HT;    He wouldn't mind a few more awards, too. Unlike many actors, he
admits that he cherishes his Oscar.
 &HT;    ``My Oscar is on a bookshelf in my apartment in L.A.,'' he says.
``I was going to slap it on the dash in my '69 Cadillac under the
fuzzy dice, but I figured it would probably get ripped off. I could
imagine getting carjacked.''
 &HT;    In fact, he speculates, he might even know the carjacker from
his tour behind bars.
 &HT;    ``I would be like, `Buddy, it's me _ your friend, Benny! Take
the car. Take Matt. But could I please keep my Oscar?'''

NEW DAWN OF THE JUDDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singers Naomi and Wynonna Judd.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Ask Wynonna Judd if she ever again expected to sing with her
mother, Naomi, and she doesn't say no.
 &HT;    ``Not no, but hell no,'' the 36-year-old singer says. ``That's
my answer for everything when it comes to the Judds being back. I
am absolutely somewhere between in awe and `God, you certainly have
a sense of humor' to `I can't believe this is happening.'''
 &HT;    She isn't the only one surprised. So is the country-music
industry, not to mention the legion of fans who scooped up more
than 20 million copies of Judds albums during the 1980s and early
1990s.
 &HT;    As far as the Judds themselves knew, however, the duo was
history after Naomi was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1990. She
retired from music, expecting to die within a few years, while
Wynonna launched a successful solo career.
 &HT;    But then something unexpected happened: Naomi, relying mostly on
holistic- and alternative-healing methods, staged a miraculous
recovery. Today, her doctors can find no trace of the disease.
 &HT;    ``I'm just enjoying this medical miracle that I am,'' the
54-year-old Naomi says, ``and everything came all of a sudden into
a confluence from that.''
 &HT;    ``Everything'' includes a Judds reunion performance last New
Year's Eve in Phoenix, hosted by Wynonna's younger sister, actress
Ashley Judd. Exhilarated, the Judds decided to mount a full
reunion, the two-month ``Power to Change'' tour, and also returned
to the studio to record four new songs that are included as a bonus
on Wynonna's new album, ``New Day Dawning'' (Universal Music,
2000).
 &HT;    The whole chain of events has left her reeling, Wynonna admits.
 &HT;    ``I'm really, quite frankly, just now starting to get used to
it, because it's taken me almost a year to sort of process and
filter the different emotions I've been experiencing through all of
this,'' the singer says. ``She's not supposed to be here _ people
forget about that.
 &HT;    ``For whatever reason, people think we have a perfect formula
for everything,'' Wynonna says. ``But I remember when she didn't
get out of bed for days _ I used to have to go visit her, and she'd
be in her pajamas and I'd be like, `Mom, don't you want to put
clothes on?' and she'd be, `No, I don't feel like it.'
 &HT;    ``Now I'm looking at her onstage, singing and dancing around,''
Wynonna says with a shrug. ``Go figure. It doesn't make any sense
to me _ I'm just happy with the way it's all turned out.''
 &HT;    The intervening years have brought about a much better
relationship between the two singers, she adds. Naomi's drive is
legendary _ she left her husband while her children were young and
struggled to raise them on a nurse's salary while fostering their
artistic interests, then joined Wynonna to form a singing act
which, after years of lean times, broke through to stardom in the
1980s _ but she was never the easiest person to live or work with.
 &HT;    ``We are, as you know, very emotional and very spiritual,'' says
Wynonna, who admits to having resented her mother's relentless
ambition throughout their early career, ``and we can sometimes suck
the energy out of a room pretty fast. It's like, bring your own
oxygen when you're with the Judds.''
 &HT;    By her own account, Naomi found it hard to combine show-business
professionalism with raising an ambivalent, depressive teen as both
daughter and co-star.
 &HT;    ``In one sense it was actually maddening,'' she says, ``because
if she was late _ which 99 percent of the time she was _ it just
sent me to the moon, because I'm the organized, prepared, punctual
one, and I just wanted everybody to love her. So I had to make
excuses for her, and then I'd jerk her on the bus and threaten to
pull her hair out.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, however, Naomi says ``it's just a lot more fun.''
 &HT;    The two women cut what she calls ``that psychological umbilical
chord'' following their 1991 farewell tour, a 10-month trek that
grossed more than $21 million. Now Wynonna is an established star
in her own right, with more than 9 million albums sold, six No. 1
hits and four Grammys of her own.
 &HT;    And in a role reversal, it's Wynonna who's now the working
mother of two _ divorced, she's currently dating her longtime
bodyguard, Dan Roach. She's also the one who now controls the
collaboration, having co-produced the four Judds songs that appear
on ``New Day Dawning.''
 &HT;    ``I'm looking at my kid, going `What do you think about this
harmony part, boss?''' Naomi says with a laugh. ``I love it. I'm in
awe of Wynonna Judd _ she's the voice of her generation, and for me
to get to stand next to her, to even be on the same stage and lend
harmony to her, just blows my mind.''
 &HT;    Her daughter laughs.
 &HT;    ``I love it,'' Wynonna says, ``because we're communicating now
as a family, and it's pretty awesome. I have a new appreciation for
my mother that I didn't have when I was 18 and trying to get off
the bus.''
 &HT;    Which means goodbye to the flamboyant Judd-vs.-Judd rumor mill,
she adds.
 &HT;    ``We work so well together and we get along so well that, quite
frankly, it's pretty boring for the tabloids and the people out
there who want some juicy story,'' Wynonna says. ``Though we're
talking about getting her a little hair extension, so that next
time we're on TV we can get into a fight and I can pull it out,
just to get people talking!''
 &HT;    Their fans shouldn't count on a long-term professional reunion
between Wynonna and Naomi _ who live, along with Ashley, on farms
in an area outside Nashville they refer to as Peaceful Valley. Both
see their current collaboration as a short-term thing.
 &HT;    Having established her own star, Wynonna no longer wants to
sublimate her identity in a team, while Naomi, who made her acting
debut last fall in the television movie ``A Holiday Romance,'' has
a crowded slate of projects that includes writing books, hosting a
weekly self-help radio show, ``Heart to Heart,'' and working to
bring about a cure for hepatitis C.
 &HT;    ``I am so fiercely committed to that, I can't go back into music
full time,'' Naomi says. ``I've been freed of a virus, but I'm not
going to feel free til we lick this whole thing.''
 &HT;    Wynonna, meanwhile, says that she's satisfied to enjoy working
with her mother in the present, without worrying about the future.
 &HT;    ``This is a vacation for me,'' she says. ``People think that I'm
taking this back step or that I'm sitting back and relaxing with
Mom again. They think I'm doing this for professional reasons.
 &HT;    ``Uh-uh _ I'm doing this because I want to, and because I can,''
she says. ``She's my mother. I've been on the road half my life
with this woman, and I wanted to take time out to say `Thank you'
and to celebrate the Judds' music.
 &HT;    ``And I don't think anybody believes me,'' Wynonna admits.
``They think we have to stay separate. I don't see it that way _ as
long as I keep myself intact about who I am, with and without her,
I'll be OK.
 &HT;    ``I don't get lost in her anymore, and I don't feel like the
Judds are taking over,'' she says. ``But they're a heck of a lot of
fun to be with, lemme tell ya.''

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Leon as Little Richard in a scene from
``Little Richard.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Little Richard is rocking, rolling and practically screaming
into the telephone.
 &HT;    ``I am the architect of rock 'n' roll!'' he says. ``When I came
on the scene there wasn't no rock 'n' roll _ it was swing and sway
with Sammy Kaye! There were `Pennies from Heaven,' but they weren't
falling in my neighborhood!
 &HT;    ``So I a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-wop-bam-boomed with `Tutti
Frutti.'''
 &HT;    Richard laughs.
 &HT;    ``See, there really is no such thing as rock 'n' roll,'' he
says. ``Rhythm and blues had a baby, and somebody named it rock 'n'
roll. I came out with all this wailing and hollering and banging on
the piano. There wasn't nobody else doing it _ there's wasn't no
Bill Haley, there wasn't no Jerry Lee Lewis, there wasn't no Elvis.
There was nobody when I started.
 &HT;    ``I am the originator,'' he exults. ``I am the emancipator! I am
the architect, the true architect of rock 'n' roll! Without any
doubt!''
 &HT;    At 67, Richard still has the outsized personality that made him
a music legend, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and,
now, the subject of a television biopic, ``Little Richard,'' set to
air Feb. 20 on NBC.
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from somewhere on the road, the Artist
Formerly Known as Richard Wayne Penniman says that the movie comes
at a good time.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to see it while I was still here,'' he says,
laughing. ``You know, they had started to do the movie without me.
They were doing an unauthorized version, then I came in on it.''
 &HT;    Leon, star of the miniseries ``The Temptations'' and the films
``Cool Runnings'' (1993) and ``Bats'' (1999), not to mention
Madonna's controversial music video ``Like a Prayer,'' plays the
title role in ``Little Richard.'' The original admits that he had
another candidate in mind.
 &HT;    ``Prince said he wanted to do it,'' Richard says. ``He came to
me two weeks after the deal came together with NBC, but it was too
late.
 &HT;    ``I think Leon did a good job of (playing) me in that period,''
the singer concedes. ``He's a very good actor. I wasn't on the set
a lot because I was on tour, but it was hard to watch someone play
me.''
 &HT;    Directed by Robert Townsend, the film covers Richard's
childhood, his tortured relationship with his father (Carl Lumbly),
the emergence of the brash, daring, gender-bending Little Richard
look, his early successes and, ultimately, his 1962 decision to
retire and devote his life to God.
 &HT;    On one set visit, the singer found himself watching a
re-creation of his father's funeral.
 &HT;    ``That was really touching,'' he says. ``It was strange to go
back to that time, but I would like for the audience to see the
struggle I went through.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' he adds, ``Robert could have made the struggle a
little more prominent. My daddy used to whup me and draw blood out
of me when I was a child. He used to beat me so bad _ he couldn't
stand me.''
 &HT;    Richard stops for a moment, his customary bravado fading almost
to a whisper.
 &HT;    ``Through all of the odds I still came through,'' he says. ``It
was very hard for me, but I still came out OK.''
 &HT;    For his own part, Leon says he nearly turned down the role.
 &HT;    ``At first I wasn't at all interested,'' he says, speaking by
telephone from a friend's New York apartment. ``I thought, `Why
would I want to play Little Richard? He's still around. He's so
flamboyant, and everybody thinks they know him already. Why would I
put myself up against that scrutiny?'
 &HT;    ``But once I realized the story ends 38 years ago, once I
realized that the young guy I play became Little Richard, it became
quite interesting to me,'' he says. ``Also, I got to sing, dance,
cry, wear a bra, have a pompadour and be totally outrageous. I
could put all of my talents on display in one movie, which is very
rare.''
 &HT;    The actor didn't spend much time with Little Richard, he says,
to avoid feeling too pressured to imitate him. Instead he plastered
vintage photos in his trailer, listened to the old records and went
with the flow.
 &HT;    ``I think Richard's most important accomplishment is the music
he gave the world, and more important was the time at which he gave
it,'' Leon says. ``His music brought people, black and white,
together, and it opened the doors for so many other people.
 &HT;    ``What intrigued me most about the film, though, was that it's a
family story,'' the actor adds. ``It's about someone who cared
deeply about his family and religion, and gave up everything at the
height of his career for religion.
 &HT;    ``That's a bit of a unique story, especially among rock 'n' roll
legends,'' Leon says. ``Usually they fall prey to drugs or hook up
with the wrong women, rather than give it up over a deep feeling
for God.''
 &HT;    After quitting the business, Little Richard preached at the
church of his youth in Macon, Ga. A few years later, however, he
was tricked into appearing at a rock concert. The old fever struck,
and ever since he has sought to strike a balance between music and
religion.
 &HT;    ``God is still as important to me today,'' the singer says. ``He
still works through me. It was very troubling at first, though _ it
took a while for me to learn the difference between my work and my
religion, to learn that there's a price for everything.''
 &HT;    As for the possibility of a sequel to ``Little Richard,'' the
title character is all for it.
 &HT;    ``Without any doubt!'' he shouts. ``The story in the second half
would pick up where this one leaves off. The first half doesn't go
far enough because they couldn't go far enough _ they were so
limited with time.
 &HT;    ``The hardships came again in my life,'' he says. ``Things were
hard. Then `Down and Out in Beverly Hills' brought me back from
that.''
 &HT;    Paul Mazursky's 1986 comedy thrust Little Richard into the
spotlight again. Not only did he act in the film, but he hit the
pop charts for the first time in nearly two decades with a
soundtrack song, ``Great Gosh A-Mighty.''
 &HT;    ``Paul got all these people with hardships like myself, Bette
Midler, Nick Nolte and Richard Dreyfuss,'' he says. ``We were all
down and out until that film came out.''
 &HT;    Since then Richard has been on the road almost constantly,
pausing only to make an occasional television guest appearance or
to film a commercial. He doesn't record, however, and doubts that
he will again any time soon. The record market, he says, has turned
to younger artists.
 &HT;    ``I am still the architect,'' he says. ``There's just a lot of
new people out here now. This is a new day and a new way _ what can
I say?''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, all he needs to do to regain his self-confidence is
to step onto the concert stage.
 &HT;    ``Everywhere we go the crowds are still there,'' he says.
``People still like the old music. I think they like it better than
the new stuff. If you notice, even the rappers use old music _
there's nowhere else to go.''
 &HT;    And, in case anyone was wondering, he insists that he's still
the prettiest man in rock 'n' roll.
 &HT;    ``Without any doubt!'' he says, turning it on one more time.
``Without any doubt, I sing and shout!''

 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before Feb. 20. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rob Lowe is used to life in the public eye. Actually, few people
have known the pluses and minuses of fame more thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   But even he admits to being amazed at the reaction to his role
on NBC's hit series, ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Lowe knew the show was hot, but he was surprised to find
that even jaded Tinseltown types can't get enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has truly been wild,'' Lowe says with a smile, nursing a
giant cappuccino in the cafeteria adjacent to the ``West Wing''
set. ``I've felt the momentum just from running into people. I went
to the premiere of `The Talented Mr. Ripley' a while back, and I
was just staggered with the amount of people coming up and telling
me they watch the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey love it,'' he says,
grinning. ``People want me to tell them what's going to happen
next. And I know a lot of these people aren't necessarily watching
every new TV show. It's quite exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lowe, who is making his maiden voyage in television after
more than a decade of film stardom, the speed with which ``The West
Wing'' has connected with its audience is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's one of the most unique things about our show _
it reaches people,'' he says. ``Viewers are investing in the show
emotionally. They can only do that when a TV series or a movie is
very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distancing in film _ and I speak from experience
here _ but on TV there's a sort of mesh with viewers,'' he adds.
``That's the beauty of television, that's what makes it special.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its September launch, ``The West Wing'' _ the
behind-the-scenes saga of a White House administration headed by
strong-willed President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen) _ has become
a smash hit, regularly rating in the top five shows.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe plays Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn, a slick
political animal with an eye for the ladies, based loosely on
former Clinton advisor George Stephanopolous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the pilot, I was drawn to it because it was
exactly like a movie,'' Lowe recalls. ``Ironically, on any given
week we're more like a movie than some movies _ and if you watch a
lot of movies today, they're like MTV videos now.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our show, there're very long scenes _ we'll do five pages
of dialogue in one take!''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected on a hit series with such a high-octane
cast, the tabloids are already buzzing with rumors that Lowe is
unhappy with his amount of camera time and has threatened to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says writer/executive producer Aaron Sorkin, the
playwright and screenwriter _ best known for ``A Few Good Men''
(1992) and ``The American President'' (1996) _ who co-created ``The
West Wing'' with television kingpin John Wells of ``ER'' and
``Third Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a single conversation about that,'' Sorkin
says. ``Rob hasn't come to us, he hasn't said that. Those
conversations haven't happened. That shouldn't be reported, because
we haven't talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's new status as a television star marks a full-circle
turnaround from where his career stood a decade ago. In fact, the
actor has virtually reinvented himself.
</P>
<P>
   To backtrack, he was a star from his film debut in the 1983
drama ``The Outsiders,'' which also featured future stars Tom
Cruise, Matt Dillon and Patrick Swayze. He was a founding member of
what the media dubbed ``the Brat Pack,'' which also included Ally
Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe continued to turn out solid film work in movies such as
``The Hotel New Hampshire'' (1984), ``St. Elmo's Fire'' (1985) and
``About Last Night'' (1986). But things took a weird turn in 1989,
when a videotape surfaced, shot by Lowe himself and showing him
having sex with an underage girl while attending, of all things,
the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother pressed statutory-rape charges, and Lowe was
ultimately sentenced to probation and 20 hours of community service
_ a light sentence, but his career suffered from the public
perception that he was a sex maniac.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the actor has continued to work steadily, albeit in
less high-profile roles. He's also settled down considerably after
marrying makeup artist Sheryl Berkoff in 1991. Today they have two
sons, 7-year-old Matthew and 5-year-old John Owen.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Lowe has been seen mostly in comedies, including
``Wayne's World'' (1992), ``Tommy Boy'' (1995) and ``Austin Powers
2: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' (1999), generally cast as a klutzy bad
guy.
</P>
<P>
   That's another reason the 36-year-old actor signed on for ``The
West Wing'': He relished the chance to play a more mature
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show definitely skews a lot older than the people who've
been watching me in, say, `Austin Powers,''' he says. ``Sam is a
very interesting guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that, Sorkin gradually has been delving deeper into
Lowe's character over the past few months. Viewers have learned,
for example, that Sam had an affair with a pricey call girl _
although he didn't know she was a hooker.
</P>
<P>
   We've also learned that Sam is fiercely protective, which he
demonstrated when he attended a subpoena hearing to defend his
co-worker and friend, Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley
Whitford).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is a back-room brawler,'' Lowe says gleefully. ``You can
see that in the scene where I took the guy and put him against the
wall and said, `I'll break you like a pinata.' There's shades in
him of what people used to say about Bobby Kennedy _ that he was
this nice guy, then the doors would close and he would just frost
you. That's a fun flavor to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what Lowe enjoys most these days is the chance to get in
there and mix it up on a daily basis. He insists that making ``The
West Wing'' is a lot more satisfying than sitting in his trailer on
a film set, waiting for his call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a major film actor,'' he says, ``you might get to
really act _ I mean, really get down to the words and emotions _
maybe 15 days out of the year, if you're lucky. On this show, you
act every single day, five days a week, 22 weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, there are no freebies here,'' Lowe says cheerfully.
``This isn't an action movie. And my acting muscles, not
surprisingly, are stronger now than they've ever been _ because I'm
in that gym every day.''

 (Includes a color slide of Ben Affleck with Charlize Theron in a
scene from ``Reindeer Games.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Ben Affleck's beefcake photos had been carefully clipped out and
taped onto the wall, occupying a place of honor above Matt Damon
and below Leonardo DiCaprio.
 &HT;    Somehow, though, Affleck wasn't pleased.
 &HT;    The actor wasn't visiting the bedroom of some teen-age fan,
after all, but touring the cells in a maximum-security Canadian
prison, researching his role as a convict in his latest film, John
Frankenheimer's ``Reindeer Games.''
 &HT;    ``Let's just say that, going through a cellblock, I began to
regret every single hunky pose,'' Affleck says with a laugh. ``I
couldn't believe it when I saw my cover of GQ up on a few walls.
 &HT;    ``I kept thinking about how my friend Matt Damon wore that green
Speedo in `The Talented Mr. Ripley' _ I thought, `If the positions
were reversed, he'd be in real trouble!'''
 &HT;    He'd planned to spend the night in the prison, the better to
grasp a convict's point of view, but he changed his mind.
 &HT;    ``The warden called me over and said, `Ben, a lot of these guys
really liked you in ``Good Will Hunting.'' We're worried that, if
you stay over, you might be taken hostage,''' he recalls. ``I said,
`Yes, thank you, I'll be sleeping at home.'''
 &HT;    Relaxing in a gray sweater and blue jeans for an interview at
Manhattan's Essex House, Affleck is a long way from the hoosegow,
but he says it doesn't seem all that far.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' he says, ``when I was in jail, most of the inmates
had two questions, `Did you sleep with Liv Tyler during
``Armageddon?'' Are you still dating Gwyneth?'''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``You know, prisoners and celebrity journalists have a lot in
common!''
 &HT;    Affleck has never been hotter, with two films about to be
released: ``Boiler Room,'' which will open on Feb. 18, casts him as
a fast-talking corporate recruiter at a shady stockbrokerage, while
he stars in ``Reindeer Games,'' due a week later, as an ex-convict
who, in a case of mistaken identity, is taken hostage by a band of
thugs.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have work,'' he says. ``But the real question you want
to ask is, `Are you happy, Ben?'''
 &HT;    Actually, he says, that depends.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm lucky,'' he concedes, ``but I'm not always happy.
As far as fame and fortune go, I generally believe one should
understand that none of it is deserved.
 &HT;    ``Look, the phone has stopped ringing for better actors than
me.''
 &HT;    Even after he and Damon won a screenwriting Oscar for ``Good
Will Hunting'' (1997), Affleck says, things still didn't sit right
with him.
 &HT;    ``I've found it difficult to enjoy success,'' Affleck admits.
``It's strange, because when you're a young, struggling actor you
have to convince yourself that someday, when you get to the point
where you have money and roles, you'll relax and be happy.
 &HT;    ``But I've got those things,'' he says, ``and now I've found out
something depressing: The struggle is more satisfying than getting
what you want _ it's the struggle that makes you happy.''
 &HT;    For now, the struggle is definitely over. Affleck is not only in
demand with top directors and producers, but he's a certifiable
Hollywood hunk _ a status not likely to be diminished by ``Reindeer
Games,'' in which he shares an explicit sex scene with co-star
Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    ``I did not use a butt double,'' the actor swears. ``That's a
point of pride with me _ it will always be my own butt. Although I
do have a flat a--. It was one time when an actor was glad the
camera puts on 10 pounds.''
 &HT;    Affleck began acting at an early age, as a child growing up in
Central Square, the non-affluent part of Cambridge, Mass. His
parents divorced when he was a small boy, and for support he turned
to his best friend, Matt, who lived a block away.
 &HT;    Though Affleck was the first to get an agent and find work on
PBS and in local television, his agent eventually signed Damon as
well. Soon the two high-school students were taking the train to
auditions in New York.
 &HT;    For a while, things didn't go well. Affleck landed small roles
in ``School Ties'' (1992) and ``Dazed and Confused'' (1993), but
college stints in Vermont and California led nowhere and, after
breaking up with his girlfriend, he found himself homeless.
 &HT;    He headed for Los Angeles, where he crashed with Damon in a
small, two-bedroom house they shared with another friend. In their
spare time, they wrote ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997) _ and the rest
is history.
 &HT;    But not history Hollywood-style, Affleck insists.
 &HT;    ``I can't imagine myself getting to the point where I'm saying
things like, `This bleeping limo had better be a stretch!''' he
says, laughing. ``In fact, Matt and I are constantly saying, `Let's
scale things down.'
 &HT;    ``We look at each other and say, `Man, I don't care if it's a
limo _ I'm just glad I have a ride.'''
 &HT;    It's sometimes been a bumpy ride, though, especially when it
comes to his private life. All a woman has to do is say hello to
him, it seems, to start the tabloid rumors swirling.
 &HT;    ``I swear there is some guy in L.A. who looks like me,'' Affleck
says. ``And he's dating all these beautiful women.''
 &HT;    The most prominent beautiful woman in his life is Gwyneth
Paltrow, the on-again/off-again girlfriend about whom Affleck will
say nothing more than ``she's a wonderful actress'' and ``we're
very close.''
 &HT;    That may be an understatement, according to ``Reindeer Games''
co-star Clarence Williams III.
 &HT;    ``Ben's lady Gwyneth flew in to see him all the time on the
set,'' Williams says in a separate interview. ``They would be
standing in the snow and tundra, holding hands. People would gasp,
because it was like the Golden Couple had arrived.
 &HT;    ``Standing there were two Oscar winners,'' he adds. ``They're
gorgeous. They have lots of money and fame. You almost wanted to
bow to them!''
 &HT;    The speculation is bound to continue, because Affleck's next
movie is ``Bounce,'' a love story about survivors of a plane crash
due to open this summer. His co-star: Paltrow.
 &HT;    Plane crash notwithstanding, Affleck says that the worst part of
the shoot was the makeup: Because he spends much of the movie
shirtless, he had to have extensive work done to cover the multiple
tattoos that are souvenirs of his restless youth.
 &HT;    ``They have this huge, flesh-colored spray paint,'' he says.
``You just stand there, and they sandblast you for 10 minutes. The
tattoo thing was a good lesson in decisions that have long-lasting
repercussions!''
 &HT;    ``Long-lasting'' is actually a key word for Affleck, who aspires
to a long career.
 &HT;    ``I don't think you've really made it until you can say you've
had career longevity,'' he says. ``I want decades.''
 &HT;    He wouldn't mind a few more awards, too. Unlike many actors, he
admits that he cherishes his Oscar.
 &HT;    ``My Oscar is on a bookshelf in my apartment in L.A.,'' he says.
``I was going to slap it on the dash in my '69 Cadillac under the
fuzzy dice, but I figured it would probably get ripped off. I could
imagine getting carjacked.''
 &HT;    In fact, he speculates, he might even know the carjacker from
his tour behind bars.
 &HT;    ``I would be like, `Buddy, it's me _ your friend, Benny! Take
the car. Take Matt. But could I please keep my Oscar?'''

 (Includes a color slide of singers Naomi and Wynonna Judd.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Ask Wynonna Judd if she ever again expected to sing with her
mother, Naomi, and she doesn't say no.
 &HT;    ``Not no, but hell no,'' the 36-year-old singer says. ``That's
my answer for everything when it comes to the Judds being back. I
am absolutely somewhere between in awe and `God, you certainly have
a sense of humor' to `I can't believe this is happening.'''
 &HT;    She isn't the only one surprised. So is the country-music
industry, not to mention the legion of fans who scooped up more
than 20 million copies of Judds albums during the 1980s and early
1990s.
 &HT;    As far as the Judds themselves knew, however, the duo was
history after Naomi was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1990. She
retired from music, expecting to die within a few years, while
Wynonna launched a successful solo career.
 &HT;    But then something unexpected happened: Naomi, relying mostly on
holistic- and alternative-healing methods, staged a miraculous
recovery. Today, her doctors can find no trace of the disease.
 &HT;    ``I'm just enjoying this medical miracle that I am,'' the
54-year-old Naomi says, ``and everything came all of a sudden into
a confluence from that.''
 &HT;    ``Everything'' includes a Judds reunion performance last New
Year's Eve in Phoenix, hosted by Wynonna's younger sister, actress
Ashley Judd. Exhilarated, the Judds decided to mount a full
reunion, the two-month ``Power to Change'' tour, and also returned
to the studio to record four new songs that are included as a bonus
on Wynonna's new album, ``New Day Dawning'' (Universal Music,
2000).
 &HT;    The whole chain of events has left her reeling, Wynonna admits.
 &HT;    ``I'm really, quite frankly, just now starting to get used to
it, because it's taken me almost a year to sort of process and
filter the different emotions I've been experiencing through all of
this,'' the singer says. ``She's not supposed to be here _ people
forget about that.
 &HT;    ``For whatever reason, people think we have a perfect formula
for everything,'' Wynonna says. ``But I remember when she didn't
get out of bed for days _ I used to have to go visit her, and she'd
be in her pajamas and I'd be like, `Mom, don't you want to put
clothes on?' and she'd be, `No, I don't feel like it.'
 &HT;    ``Now I'm looking at her onstage, singing and dancing around,''
Wynonna says with a shrug. ``Go figure. It doesn't make any sense
to me _ I'm just happy with the way it's all turned out.''
 &HT;    The intervening years have brought about a much better
relationship between the two singers, she adds. Naomi's drive is
legendary _ she left her husband while her children were young and
struggled to raise them on a nurse's salary while fostering their
artistic interests, then joined Wynonna to form a singing act
which, after years of lean times, broke through to stardom in the
1980s _ but she was never the easiest person to live or work with.
 &HT;    ``We are, as you know, very emotional and very spiritual,'' says
Wynonna, who admits to having resented her mother's relentless
ambition throughout their early career, ``and we can sometimes suck
the energy out of a room pretty fast. It's like, bring your own
oxygen when you're with the Judds.''
 &HT;    By her own account, Naomi found it hard to combine show-business
professionalism with raising an ambivalent, depressive teen as both
daughter and co-star.
 &HT;    ``In one sense it was actually maddening,'' she says, ``because
if she was late _ which 99 percent of the time she was _ it just
sent me to the moon, because I'm the organized, prepared, punctual
one, and I just wanted everybody to love her. So I had to make
excuses for her, and then I'd jerk her on the bus and threaten to
pull her hair out.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, however, Naomi says ``it's just a lot more fun.''
 &HT;    The two women cut what she calls ``that psychological umbilical
chord'' following their 1991 farewell tour, a 10-month trek that
grossed more than $21 million. Now Wynonna is an established star
in her own right, with more than 9 million albums sold, six No. 1
hits and four Grammys of her own.
 &HT;    And in a role reversal, it's Wynonna who's now the working
mother of two _ divorced, she's currently dating her longtime
bodyguard, Dan Roach. She's also the one who now controls the
collaboration, having co-produced the four Judds songs that appear
on ``New Day Dawning.''
 &HT;    ``I'm looking at my kid, going `What do you think about this
harmony part, boss?''' Naomi says with a laugh. ``I love it. I'm in
awe of Wynonna Judd _ she's the voice of her generation, and for me
to get to stand next to her, to even be on the same stage and lend
harmony to her, just blows my mind.''
 &HT;    Her daughter laughs.
 &HT;    ``I love it,'' Wynonna says, ``because we're communicating now
as a family, and it's pretty awesome. I have a new appreciation for
my mother that I didn't have when I was 18 and trying to get off
the bus.''
 &HT;    Which means goodbye to the flamboyant Judd-vs.-Judd rumor mill,
she adds.
 &HT;    ``We work so well together and we get along so well that, quite
frankly, it's pretty boring for the tabloids and the people out
there who want some juicy story,'' Wynonna says. ``Though we're
talking about getting her a little hair extension, so that next
time we're on TV we can get into a fight and I can pull it out,
just to get people talking!''
 &HT;    Their fans shouldn't count on a long-term professional reunion
between Wynonna and Naomi _ who live, along with Ashley, on farms
in an area outside Nashville they refer to as Peaceful Valley. Both
see their current collaboration as a short-term thing.
 &HT;    Having established her own star, Wynonna no longer wants to
sublimate her identity in a team, while Naomi, who made her acting
debut last fall in the television movie ``A Holiday Romance,'' has
a crowded slate of projects that includes writing books, hosting a
weekly self-help radio show, ``Heart to Heart,'' and working to
bring about a cure for hepatitis C.
 &HT;    ``I am so fiercely committed to that, I can't go back into music
full time,'' Naomi says. ``I've been freed of a virus, but I'm not
going to feel free til we lick this whole thing.''
 &HT;    Wynonna, meanwhile, says that she's satisfied to enjoy working
with her mother in the present, without worrying about the future.
 &HT;    ``This is a vacation for me,'' she says. ``People think that I'm
taking this back step or that I'm sitting back and relaxing with
Mom again. They think I'm doing this for professional reasons.
 &HT;    ``Uh-uh _ I'm doing this because I want to, and because I can,''
she says. ``She's my mother. I've been on the road half my life
with this woman, and I wanted to take time out to say `Thank you'
and to celebrate the Judds' music.
 &HT;    ``And I don't think anybody believes me,'' Wynonna admits.
``They think we have to stay separate. I don't see it that way _ as
long as I keep myself intact about who I am, with and without her,
I'll be OK.
 &HT;    ``I don't get lost in her anymore, and I don't feel like the
Judds are taking over,'' she says. ``But they're a heck of a lot of
fun to be with, lemme tell ya.''

 (Includes a color slide of Leon as Little Richard in a scene from
``Little Richard.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Little Richard is rocking, rolling and practically screaming
into the telephone.
 &HT;    ``I am the architect of rock 'n' roll!'' he says. ``When I came
on the scene there wasn't no rock 'n' roll _ it was swing and sway
with Sammy Kaye! There were `Pennies from Heaven,' but they weren't
falling in my neighborhood!
 &HT;    ``So I a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-wop-bam-boomed with `Tutti
Frutti.'''
 &HT;    Richard laughs.
 &HT;    ``See, there really is no such thing as rock 'n' roll,'' he
says. ``Rhythm and blues had a baby, and somebody named it rock 'n'
roll. I came out with all this wailing and hollering and banging on
the piano. There wasn't nobody else doing it _ there's wasn't no
Bill Haley, there wasn't no Jerry Lee Lewis, there wasn't no Elvis.
There was nobody when I started.
 &HT;    ``I am the originator,'' he exults. ``I am the emancipator! I am
the architect, the true architect of rock 'n' roll! Without any
doubt!''
 &HT;    At 67, Richard still has the outsized personality that made him
a music legend, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and,
now, the subject of a television biopic, ``Little Richard,'' set to
air Feb. 20 on NBC.
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from somewhere on the road, the Artist
Formerly Known as Richard Wayne Penniman says that the movie comes
at a good time.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to see it while I was still here,'' he says,
laughing. ``You know, they had started to do the movie without me.
They were doing an unauthorized version, then I came in on it.''
 &HT;    Leon, star of the miniseries ``The Temptations'' and the films
``Cool Runnings'' (1993) and ``Bats'' (1999), not to mention
Madonna's controversial music video ``Like a Prayer,'' plays the
title role in ``Little Richard.'' The original admits that he had
another candidate in mind.
 &HT;    ``Prince said he wanted to do it,'' Richard says. ``He came to
me two weeks after the deal came together with NBC, but it was too
late.
 &HT;    ``I think Leon did a good job of (playing) me in that period,''
the singer concedes. ``He's a very good actor. I wasn't on the set
a lot because I was on tour, but it was hard to watch someone play
me.''
 &HT;    Directed by Robert Townsend, the film covers Richard's
childhood, his tortured relationship with his father (Carl Lumbly),
the emergence of the brash, daring, gender-bending Little Richard
look, his early successes and, ultimately, his 1962 decision to
retire and devote his life to God.
 &HT;    On one set visit, the singer found himself watching a
re-creation of his father's funeral.
 &HT;    ``That was really touching,'' he says. ``It was strange to go
back to that time, but I would like for the audience to see the
struggle I went through.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' he adds, ``Robert could have made the struggle a
little more prominent. My daddy used to whup me and draw blood out
of me when I was a child. He used to beat me so bad _ he couldn't
stand me.''
 &HT;    Richard stops for a moment, his customary bravado fading almost
to a whisper.
 &HT;    ``Through all of the odds I still came through,'' he says. ``It
was very hard for me, but I still came out OK.''
 &HT;    For his own part, Leon says he nearly turned down the role.
 &HT;    ``At first I wasn't at all interested,'' he says, speaking by
telephone from a friend's New York apartment. ``I thought, `Why
would I want to play Little Richard? He's still around. He's so
flamboyant, and everybody thinks they know him already. Why would I
put myself up against that scrutiny?'
 &HT;    ``But once I realized the story ends 38 years ago, once I
realized that the young guy I play became Little Richard, it became
quite interesting to me,'' he says. ``Also, I got to sing, dance,
cry, wear a bra, have a pompadour and be totally outrageous. I
could put all of my talents on display in one movie, which is very
rare.''
 &HT;    The actor didn't spend much time with Little Richard, he says,
to avoid feeling too pressured to imitate him. Instead he plastered
vintage photos in his trailer, listened to the old records and went
with the flow.
 &HT;    ``I think Richard's most important accomplishment is the music
he gave the world, and more important was the time at which he gave
it,'' Leon says. ``His music brought people, black and white,
together, and it opened the doors for so many other people.
 &HT;    ``What intrigued me most about the film, though, was that it's a
family story,'' the actor adds. ``It's about someone who cared
deeply about his family and religion, and gave up everything at the
height of his career for religion.
 &HT;    ``That's a bit of a unique story, especially among rock 'n' roll
legends,'' Leon says. ``Usually they fall prey to drugs or hook up
with the wrong women, rather than give it up over a deep feeling
for God.''
 &HT;    After quitting the business, Little Richard preached at the
church of his youth in Macon, Ga. A few years later, however, he
was tricked into appearing at a rock concert. The old fever struck,
and ever since he has sought to strike a balance between music and
religion.
 &HT;    ``God is still as important to me today,'' the singer says. ``He
still works through me. It was very troubling at first, though _ it
took a while for me to learn the difference between my work and my
religion, to learn that there's a price for everything.''
 &HT;    As for the possibility of a sequel to ``Little Richard,'' the
title character is all for it.
 &HT;    ``Without any doubt!'' he shouts. ``The story in the second half
would pick up where this one leaves off. The first half doesn't go
far enough because they couldn't go far enough _ they were so
limited with time.
 &HT;    ``The hardships came again in my life,'' he says. ``Things were
hard. Then `Down and Out in Beverly Hills' brought me back from
that.''
 &HT;    Paul Mazursky's 1986 comedy thrust Little Richard into the
spotlight again. Not only did he act in the film, but he hit the
pop charts for the first time in nearly two decades with a
soundtrack song, ``Great Gosh A-Mighty.''
 &HT;    ``Paul got all these people with hardships like myself, Bette
Midler, Nick Nolte and Richard Dreyfuss,'' he says. ``We were all
down and out until that film came out.''
 &HT;    Since then Richard has been on the road almost constantly,
pausing only to make an occasional television guest appearance or
to film a commercial. He doesn't record, however, and doubts that
he will again any time soon. The record market, he says, has turned
to younger artists.
 &HT;    ``I am still the architect,'' he says. ``There's just a lot of
new people out here now. This is a new day and a new way _ what can
I say?''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, all he needs to do to regain his self-confidence is
to step onto the concert stage.
 &HT;    ``Everywhere we go the crowds are still there,'' he says.
``People still like the old music. I think they like it better than
the new stuff. If you notice, even the rappers use old music _
there's nowhere else to go.''
 &HT;    And, in case anyone was wondering, he insists that he's still
the prettiest man in rock 'n' roll.
 &HT;    ``Without any doubt!'' he says, turning it on one more time.
``Without any doubt, I sing and shout!''

 (Includes a color slide of Rob Lowe in a scene from ``The West
Wing.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before Feb. 20. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rob Lowe is used to life in the public eye. Actually, few people
have known the pluses and minuses of fame more thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   But even he admits to being amazed at the reaction to his role
on NBC's hit series, ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Lowe knew the show was hot, but he was surprised to find
that even jaded Tinseltown types can't get enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has truly been wild,'' Lowe says with a smile, nursing a
giant cappuccino in the cafeteria adjacent to the ``West Wing''
set. ``I've felt the momentum just from running into people. I went
to the premiere of `The Talented Mr. Ripley' a while back, and I
was just staggered with the amount of people coming up and telling
me they watch the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey love it,'' he says,
grinning. ``People want me to tell them what's going to happen
next. And I know a lot of these people aren't necessarily watching
every new TV show. It's quite exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lowe, who is making his maiden voyage in television after
more than a decade of film stardom, the speed with which ``The West
Wing'' has connected with its audience is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's one of the most unique things about our show _
it reaches people,'' he says. ``Viewers are investing in the show
emotionally. They can only do that when a TV series or a movie is
very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distancing in film _ and I speak from experience
here _ but on TV there's a sort of mesh with viewers,'' he adds.
``That's the beauty of television, that's what makes it special.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its September launch, ``The West Wing'' _ the
behind-the-scenes saga of a White House administration headed by
strong-willed President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen) _ has become
a smash hit, regularly rating in the top five shows.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe plays Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn, a slick
political animal with an eye for the ladies, based loosely on
former Clinton advisor George Stephanopolous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the pilot, I was drawn to it because it was
exactly like a movie,'' Lowe recalls. ``Ironically, on any given
week we're more like a movie than some movies _ and if you watch a
lot of movies today, they're like MTV videos now.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our show, there're very long scenes _ we'll do five pages
of dialogue in one take!''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected on a hit series with such a high-octane
cast, the tabloids are already buzzing with rumors that Lowe is
unhappy with his amount of camera time and has threatened to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says writer/executive producer Aaron Sorkin, the
playwright and screenwriter _ best known for ``A Few Good Men''
(1992) and ``The American President'' (1996) _ who co-created ``The
West Wing'' with television kingpin John Wells of ``ER'' and
``Third Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a single conversation about that,'' Sorkin
says. ``Rob hasn't come to us, he hasn't said that. Those
conversations haven't happened. That shouldn't be reported, because
we haven't talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's new status as a television star marks a full-circle
turnaround from where his career stood a decade ago. In fact, the
actor has virtually reinvented himself.
</P>
<P>
   To backtrack, he was a star from his film debut in the 1983
drama ``The Outsiders,'' which also featured future stars Tom
Cruise, Matt Dillon and Patrick Swayze. He was a founding member of
what the media dubbed ``the Brat Pack,'' which also included Ally
Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe continued to turn out solid film work in movies such as
``The Hotel New Hampshire'' (1984), ``St. Elmo's Fire'' (1985) and
``About Last Night'' (1986). But things took a weird turn in 1989,
when a videotape surfaced, shot by Lowe himself and showing him
having sex with an underage girl while attending, of all things,
the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother pressed statutory-rape charges, and Lowe was
ultimately sentenced to probation and 20 hours of community service
_ a light sentence, but his career suffered from the public
perception that he was a sex maniac.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the actor has continued to work steadily, albeit in
less high-profile roles. He's also settled down considerably after
marrying makeup artist Sheryl Berkoff in 1991. Today they have two
sons, 7-year-old Matthew and 5-year-old John Owen.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Lowe has been seen mostly in comedies, including
``Wayne's World'' (1992), ``Tommy Boy'' (1995) and ``Austin Powers
2: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' (1999), generally cast as a klutzy bad
guy.
</P>
<P>
   That's another reason the 36-year-old actor signed on for ``The
West Wing'': He relished the chance to play a more mature
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show definitely skews a lot older than the people who've
been watching me in, say, `Austin Powers,''' he says. ``Sam is a
very interesting guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that, Sorkin gradually has been delving deeper into
Lowe's character over the past few months. Viewers have learned,
for example, that Sam had an affair with a pricey call girl _
although he didn't know she was a hooker.
</P>
<P>
   We've also learned that Sam is fiercely protective, which he
demonstrated when he attended a subpoena hearing to defend his
co-worker and friend, Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley
Whitford).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is a back-room brawler,'' Lowe says gleefully. ``You can
see that in the scene where I took the guy and put him against the
wall and said, `I'll break you like a pinata.' There's shades in
him of what people used to say about Bobby Kennedy _ that he was
this nice guy, then the doors would close and he would just frost
you. That's a fun flavor to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what Lowe enjoys most these days is the chance to get in
there and mix it up on a daily basis. He insists that making ``The
West Wing'' is a lot more satisfying than sitting in his trailer on
a film set, waiting for his call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a major film actor,'' he says, ``you might get to
really act _ I mean, really get down to the words and emotions _
maybe 15 days out of the year, if you're lucky. On this show, you
act every single day, five days a week, 22 weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, there are no freebies here,'' Lowe says cheerfully.
``This isn't an action movie. And my acting muscles, not
surprisingly, are stronger now than they've ever been _ because I'm
in that gym every day.''

   The Texas cattlemen's lawsuit against Oprah Winfrey is over. The
cattlemen lost the legal battle _ as they should have. But their
lawsuit sent a warning to the news media and members of the public:
Don't criticize agricultural products or you may find yourself in
an expensive legal wrangle that can continue for years.

   In April 1996, the ``Oprah Winfrey Show'' aired a program
focusing on the hidden dangers in food. The discussion with the
television show's guests turned to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a
fatal brain disease diagnosed in England, and attributed to beef
infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or Mad Cow
Disease. Scientists in England determined that BSE is caused by
feeding cattle parts of dead cattle and sheep.

   A few days after the ``Oprah Winfrey Show'' aired on local TV
stations, cattle prices temporarily plunged. It didn't take long
for a group of Texas cattlemen to sue Oprah Winfrey and the show's
producer, Harpo Productions Inc., under the Texas food
disparagement act. The cattlemen claimed they had lost millions of
dollars because of statements made on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Although in March 1996, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had
put a voluntary ban on the practice in our country, some cattle
operations continued to feed cows to cows. Many months after the
``Oprah Winfrey Show'' aired, the USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration finally ordered a total halt to feeding cattle the
bone and ground-up scraps of sheep and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Lyman, a former rancher, was a guest on the ``Oprah
Winfrey Show.'' At the time, he was working for the Humane Society
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from Winfrey, Lyman talked about the
potential for Americans being struck with the brain disease from
infected U.S. cattle. He was also named in the cattlemen's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 26, 1998, after a six-week trial, the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled against the
cattlemen. An Amarillo jury, steeped in a cattle and ranching
culture, found that Winfrey, Lyman and the show's producer did not
libel cattle. Under the Texas food disparagement act, a person
bringing the libel lawsuit must prove that the defendant knowingly
disseminated false information about a food product. The cattlemen
could not prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was no way for them to prove it. The statements
critical of cattle feeding practices in the United States made on
the ``Oprah Winfrey Show'' were based upon factual information.
</P>
<P>
   The cattlemen appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit. They lost again. On Feb. 9, the appellate court
affirmed the lower court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither court's decision reached the
constitutional free speech question involved because the case was
decided on statutory law.
</P>
<P>
   However, both federal courts indicated that the First Amendment
would have protected Winfrey and her guests even if they had
violated the Texas disparagement law.
</P>
<P>
   The cattlemen could petition the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
for a rehearing before all the Fifth Circuit judges. Petitions for
en banc hearings are rarely granted.
</P>
<P>
   The cattlemen could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. However,
less than one-half of 1 percent of requested appeals are granted by
the high court each year. It is safe to say that the lawsuit has
come to the end of its long and expensive road.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Texas Legislature, the president of
Harpo Productions said the lawsuit had already cost his company
over $1 million. In an interview on Feb. 11, Lyman said that one
would ``need to have close to a million dollars in pocket'' to
fight such a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In our interview, Lyman said, ``This was not about food
disparagement. This was about the Golden Rule. This was about
people with a lot of gold who thought they could go and make the
rules. All I can say is, thank God that Oprah Winfrey didn't just
turn around and write them a check and had the nerve and the guts
to stand up for all the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyman, who was a rancher in Montana for 45 years, said of the
trial, ``I've been in some stressful situations in my life, but
nothing reaches this plateau. When you end up with a thousand head
of cows that are calving and you're in the middle of a blizzard and
then the sun starts shining and you end up with sunburned bags and
the cows start kicking the calves off, that's stress. But it
doesn't reach the level of being in that courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Babcock, the attorney for Winfrey in this lawsuit, said in
an interview, ``I can't imagine that anybody is going to try to go
through what these cattlemen went through to rely upon this (food
disparagement) statute. It's a very hard thing to prove, as they
found out. I just doubt there's going to be much appetite for using
this statute in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed a
long-standing legal principle: ``People in this country, including
Oprah Winfrey, have the right to express their opinions about
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One might add, if they have the money to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   By any reckoning, the cattlemen must have spent nearly $2
million in the lawsuit in order to attempt to recoup the $4 million
they claimed to have lost when cattle prices fell. Bad strategy _
if that were the real intent.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Collins, head of the FoodSpeak Project of the Center for
Science in Public Interest in Washington, D.C., makes sense of the
cattlemen's expensive strategy. He sees the result of the lawsuit
differently than Babcock.
</P>
<P>
   Collins claims the cattlemen sent a message to the American
public: ``If anyone wants to say anything critical about our
product in the future, they better be prepared to litigate for 45
months, better be prepared to spend untold amounts of money in
attorney fees, better be prepared for a lot of courtroom
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins added that even if one wins, ``It's the kind of winning
that would bankrupt most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states have passed food disparagement laws since 1991.
However, agricultural interests have not won a single case in the
courts under these statutes. Obviously, the laws do not help
farmers or ranchers recoup losses from statements damaging to their
products.
</P>
<P>
   These food libel laws were created for one purpose: to
intimidate critics, to shut them up. And the Oprah Winfrey lawsuit
only accentuates that point. This nation's cherished tradition of
free speech isn't only for those wealthy enough to defend their use
of that right. It's for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Food disparagement laws are undemocratic and clash with the
bedrock concept this nation's founders gave us concerning the
people's right to govern themselves. We, the people, must be able
to debate any public issue without fear of legal repercussions.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Terrified residents described deafening thunder,
continuous lightning that lit the sky and roaring winds as
tornadoes swept through Southwest Georgia shortly after midnight,
killing at least 11 people.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest hit area was in Mitchell County, south of Albany,
where a twister cut a five-mile path through a residential area of
mostly mobile homes about 12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were killed in Mitchell County, said Buzz Weiss of
the Georgia Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Another four were killed in Grady County, and one died in
Colquitt County, Weiss said. He said there were unconfirmed reports
of another person dead in Grady County. The Associated Press
reported 13 dead in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In Grady County, the four died in three different homes, said
Toby Roland, the county's emergency management director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tornado hit in the northeast corner of the county, in an
area that's mostly farmland,'' he said. ``Our preliminary count
indicates at least 15 homes were damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said at least 100 people were injured by the storms. Gov.
Roy Barnes and Gary McConnell, GEMA director, flew down this
morning to assess the damage and the governor was expected to ask
for a federal disaster declaration for the four counties _ Grady,
Mitchell, Colquitt and Tift _ where the worst damage occurred,
according to Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross opened shelters in Moultrie and Camilla, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 people were treated during the early morning hours
at the 33-bed Mitchell County Hospital, which sent dozens of
seriously injured patients to other area hospitals in Albany,
Thomasville, Moultrie and Tallahassee, Fla., said administrator Ron
Gilliard. Many of the injured had head injuries, broken limbs and
severe lacerations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary,'' said Gilliard, whose home was damaged
shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliard, his parents, his brother and a cousin live in an area
south of Camilla devastated by the tornados. ``My wife and I ran to
the bathroom, held each other and prayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliard said his first cousin suffered lacerations when his
mobile home was destroyed. ``It was in a pecan grove, where every
tree was uprooted,'' he said. ``He was bleeding profusely. I put
him in my car and drove him to the hospital. It took us 45 minutes
to go the three miles because of downed trees and power lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The small, 33-bed hospital quickly became ``a war zone,'' he
said, as more than 120 injured people poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallway was lined with patients; we took mattresses off
older beds and put them on the floor; we had patients in chairs, on
cots.''
</P>
<P>
   Trees were blown down, a brick house was lifted off its
foundation and witnesses said a tractor-trailer was flipped on its
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you heard was a roar, woo-woo-woo,'' said Johnny Jones,
whose mobile home about two miles south of Camilla was lifted by
winds and landed on its side.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was able to free his 14-year-old son, who was
pinned under a washing machine, and they crawled out a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could see was that everything was demolished. People
were hollering and crying `Where's my child?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storms were spawned by a strong weather system that
developed ahead of a cold front sweeping eastward from the
Mississippi Valley region, the Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching Georgia, the storms caused scattered damage in
much of Alabama, downing trees and leaving thousands of Alabamians
without power.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado apparently touched down in south Montgomery County,
downing power lines, overturning mobile homes and destroying a
business, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   An officer who lives in the area reported seeing the twister
Sunday afternoon and said it ``was a quarter-mile wide,'' said
Melvin Turner, assistant chief deputy.
</P>
<P>
   He said no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Marshall County, a church was blown into the middle of the
road near Boaz, according to local EMA officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Cullman, several houses and businesses were damaged and power
lines were downed, a police spokesman said. He said the damage was
``pretty widespread'' throughout the town but no injuries had been
reported. The Cullman Electric Cooperative estimated that 15,000 of
its 36,000 customers were without power.

   These are just two of many satisfied editors who have published
``The Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major moments in the
civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell, the nationally
acclaimed black journalist whose early career was shaped by that
dynamic era.
</P>
<P>
   The series is available exclusively from The New York Times
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter, writes about
Americans, black and white, during a time that transformed
attitudes about race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Association of Black Journalists presented
Caldwell with its President's Award, saying his record of
professional achievement made him ``one of the most important
journalists in the last 50 years.''

<P>
   &UR; PART 1: HERE COMES BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the
place for the easily embarrassed or intimidated,'' Caldwell writes.
``I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 4: WHITE REPORTERS OUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X is shot, two reporters
are right up in front in the Audubon Ballroom, so close to the
podium that when the shooting starts, they have to dive to the
floor for cover. The journalists: Stan Scott and Gene Simpson. How
they got into the ballroom that afternoon played large part in
ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

   &UR; PART 1: HERE COMES BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the
place for the easily embarrassed or intimidated,'' Caldwell writes.
``I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 4: WHITE REPORTERS OUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X is shot, two reporters
are right up in front in the Audubon Ballroom, so close to the
podium that when the shooting starts, they have to dive to the
floor for cover. The journalists: Stan Scott and Gene Simpson. How
they got into the ballroom that afternoon played large part in
ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

   &UR; PART 1: HERE COMES BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester,
N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the fall of 1963,
he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his first assignment
for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks, housing was the
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.

</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the Herald Tribune for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin.
Lewis had been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the
exploding story of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to
literally camp out in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York
to report and write about what was taking place. A white reporter
could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name that
African nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant hair groomed and worn
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester,
N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the fall of 1963,
he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his first assignment
for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks, housing was the
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

Monday, Feb. 1, The New York times Syndicate is offering a
five-part feature, ``The Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major
moments in the civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell,
the nationally acclaimed black journalist whose early career was
shaped by that dynamic era. Caldwell, a former New York Times
reporter, was witness to some of the most important events of the
last 40 years. He covered the riots that swept many American cities
during the summer of 1967. In 1995, the National Association of
Black Journalists presented Caldwell with its President's Award,
saying his record of professional achievement made him ``one of the
most important journalists in the last 50 years.'' Caldwell is
currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C. Maynard Institute
for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and is writing ``The

<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the Herald Tribune for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin.
Lewis had been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the
exploding story of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to
literally camp out in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York
to report and write about what was taking place. A white reporter
could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name that
African nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant hair groomed and worn
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

   DIALLO-MOTHER (Albany, N.Y.) _ Kadiatou Diallo sits in a hotel
room at the Crowne Plaza wearing a violet-colored gown with ivory
trim at the neck and embroidery at the cuffs, a black turtleneck, a
head wrap and slippers on her feet. Inside the lamp-lit suite, she
talks about her first child. Did she find it difficult to take care
of her infant son when she was only 16 years old? ``It was like we
grew up together,'' she says. ``That's why I say it's very
painful.'' By THEOLA S. LABBE.
</P>
<P>
   INDENTURED-SERVANTS (San Francisco) _ Nobee Saeieo thought she
was coming from Thailand to the United States as a $240-a-month
cook, but she got much less than she bargained for. She was forced
to fix meals, give manicures and serve guests on her knees, 18
hours a day, seven days a week. Dung, a 13-year-old from Vietnam,
was sold to a Silicon Valley executive, who planned to bring her
here to satisfy his sexual demands, federal prosecutors say. These
are just two of the 150 people who federal prosecutors say have
been victims of slavery or indentured servitude in the past five
years. By ERIC McCORMICK and JIM HERRON ZAMORA.

   CALIF-DEMS (San Jose, Calif.) _ California Democrats haven't

   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LOIS-CONVENTION (San Antonio) _ The last time the name Lois made
it onto any sort of popular baby names list was back in the 1930s,
when it ranked an admirable 18th. Ethel, Margaret and Harold were
on that list also. Yet this week, San Antonio will have the largest
concentration of women named Lois in the world. Maybe even a couple
of guys. It's the annual convention of the National Lois Club. By
IHOSVANI RODRIGUEZ.
</P>
<P>
   SF-DEVELOPMENT (San Francisco) _ As Internet millionaires and
their lucrative dot-coms redefine the Bay Area, residents are
sharing in the boom times but also finding themselves victims of
their own success. Urban sprawl and traffic congestion, poverty and
homelessness, the quality of public schools and a host of other
issues worried many of the 500 Bay Area residents recently polled
by the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C. By ANNIE
NAKAO.
</P>
<P>
   TARZAN-MINISTER (Albany, N.Y.) _ Fans of Tarzan creator Edgar
Rice Burroughs can thank Henry Heins, a retired Lutheran minister,
for some new reading material. It was Heins who helped bring into
print recently two unpublished Burroughs works, a 1924 novel,
``Marcia of the Doorstep,'' and a 1927 play, ``You Lucky Girl!'' By
PAUL GRONDAHL.
</P>
<P>
   CINNABAR-LACQUER (Undated) _ To restore cinnabar carvings in the
original technique can be costly, requiring up to 100 thin coats of
lacquer. A less expensive repair would be to fill in with a
composition material in the approximate coloring before recarving
the design. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.

<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ Just because Steve Young and
Jerry Rice are among 40 players the 49ers have under contract after
the great Salary Cap Purge of 2000 does not necessarily mean they
will be with the team next season. That's because the club is not
through tweaking its roster in the wake of its worst season in 20
years. Between now and the draft in April the 49ers will attempt to
sign their own free agents and, cap room permitting, pursue players
on the free agent market. By JOHN CRUMPACKER.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-GIANTS (San Francisco) _ A new era of Giants baseball is
here, an era in which the Giants aren't even the top draw in their
own ballpark. The park itself is the real draw, judging by the
phenomenon that the
</P>
<P>
   entire 2000 season will probably sell out by Opening Day. By
JOHN SHEA.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ How can the outdoor experience
be improved in the San Francisco Bay Area? At the Sportsmen's Expo
last weekend, hundreds of people provided suggestions for bettering
hiking, fishing, boating, biking and conservation. By TOM
STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-WALKERS (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Go ahead and laugh at the
funny racewalkers. Everyone else does. But with resting heart rates
of around 40, they will be swiveling their hips and striding across
the graves of those who mocked them. That's a lot of ground to
cover. By JOHN CRUMPACKER.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The corner of Polk and Ellis in
San Francisco, a block from the X-rated O'Farrell Theater, is an
unlikely place to hear this sentence, but this is what Tom Nolan
said: ``What we're about is re-creating small-town America in a big
city.`` By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The Democratic Party organization
in Albany County is one of the best political operations in the
country. If Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign staff had let the
local party people run one of the Senate candidate's recent
fund-raising affairs, they would have left with the same money, at
least. And they might have left with a few friends. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   PORT-CHICAGO (San Antonio) _ Two years ago, President Clinton
called for a dialogue on race. How about a congressional debate on
the World War II explosion at Port Chicago in California, the
catalyst for the Navy to become the first service branch to
desegregate and a racial issue that remains unresolved to this day.
By BOB RICHTER.
</P>
<P>
   CULTURE-WARS (Mill Valley, Calif.) _ While in Washington,D.C.,
recently, I visited the National Endowment for the Arts. A
Traveling Jewish Theatre _ the non-profit theater I helped found
and still co-direct _ would probably not have survived for over two
decades had it not been funded in its formative years by the NEA.
During my visit, I was confronted with tangible evidence of what it
means to be on the front lines of the so-called culture wars. By
COREY FISCHER.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ It's business as usual this morning at the

their first cup of decaf. As is also usual, nobody's agreeing on
anything other than they'd all sooner vote for Tiny Hodelman than
for Al Gore or ``Little George.'' ``If the rest of Ohio feels the

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ It's business as usual this morning at the
local cafe. My retired farmer buddies are talking politics over
their first cup of decaf. As is also usual, nobody's agreeing on
anything other than they'd all sooner vote for Tiny Hodelman than
for Al Gore or ``Little George.'' ``If the rest of Ohio feels the
way you guys do,'' I warn them, ``the upcoming primary is going to
knock the pollsters for a loop...and who's Tiny Hodelman?''

Violence increasing off the field in NFL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Violent acts by NFL players this season created so much
controversy that critics are calling it the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day it seems as if another player is being charged
with a crime, making the league a convenient target for criticism
from those who believe the owners are more concerned with making
money than cleansing the NFL of the criminal element that provides
a bad role model for the youth of America.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's public relations machine counters with statistics that
show the percentage of crimes committed by players is less than
society in general. The league contends that because the NFL is so
popular, it is going to be under the microscope more than other
industries and that everything is going to be magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've definitely got to be careful in this league,''
Jacksonville offensive tackle Leon Searcy said. ``Any time we do
something, it's public. Association brings on assimilation. The
people you associate with can put a damper on your reputation.
We've got to be careful about who we hang out with. We've got to
let them know, `When you do something, it reflects on me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Players have to avoid those situations and learn not to get
involved in circumstances that lead to consequences. Everything you
do is going to be magnified by 100, whether you're innocent or
guilty. And you're going to be perceived as guilty until proven
innocent because of your stature. It's unfortunate, (but) we know
coming into the NFL that we have to use better judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of NFL players are being branded by the actions of
a few, which doesn't sit well with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of players who aren't involved in anything
illegal or violent,'' Buffalo guard Ruben Brown said. ``That should
let you know there isn't some trait in a football player to be that
type of violent person society knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who don't play football commit those crimes.
To think we're exempt is ridiculous. We're no different from the
rest of society in that some of us are good and some of us are bad.
Just because we play football doesn't mean we're going to run
around killing people or doing things of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime is not new in the NFL. Former Carolina receiver
Rae Carruth wasn't the first player to be charged with committing a
murder during the season. In 1951, Pittsburgh Steelers receiver
Jerry Nuzum was arrested for allegedly murdering a waitress in New
Mexico. A judge dismissed the case for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Murder accusations get the attention of the news media, not just
the sports media. It also attracts the interest of non-sports fans.
The media fuel interest.
</P>
<P>
   When Carruth was charged with first-degree murder in the
shooting death of his girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time, it
received worldwide publicity. She died, but the baby lived.
</P>
<P>
   When Baltimore middle linebacker Ray Lewis, who had been voted
as a starter in the Pro Bowl, was charged with double murder
resulting from a fight outside an Atlanta nightclub after Super
Bowl XXXIV, interest skyrocketed. And the media feeding frenzy
began.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carruth, Lewis remains in jail. Many have an opinion about
why they are there and what they could have done to avoid their
situations, but Cleveland Browns owner Al Lerner might have put it
best.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Lewis, Lerner said: ``He was trained to be a great
athlete. He was never trained to be a multimillionaire. He was
never trained to handle that kind of exposure and the things that
got shoved in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do we remember walking away from an incident
and it was good that we did? These kids may not know enough about
just walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams have programs to educate and help players.
Psychologists and doctors participate in the programs, which cost
each team about $1 million a year to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis plays for the Ravens, who had a seven-part lecture series
during the last offseason on how players should conduct themselves.
Topics covered in the series involved drug counseling,
accountability both personally and professionally, and
relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate and we don't condone misconduct,'' NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``We do strike a balance between
that and giving people a second chance, recognizing that some of
the misconduct by NFL players has occurred before they were NFL
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have in place a very comprehensive, very active set of
programs, and they focus on prevention, and they are all tied
together. We have counseling on a league-wide basis. We have
treatment. We have prevention and we have discipline, and I think
the players respond in a very positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not. Can we
predict when a player such as Rae Carruth is going to have a
problem? Of course not. We can't predict that any more than others
in society can predict that students are going to shoot other
students or that workers are going to shoot other workers in the
workplace. You can't predict when there is going to be aberrant
behavior. Nor can you understand it after it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL players have been involved in many other recent incidents,
but fans have become almost immune to them.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Indianapolis defensive back Steve Muhammad was
charged with battery in the beating of his pregnant wife. He was
cleared in the deaths of his wife and stillborn child that resulted
from a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Miami rookie running back Cecil Collins, who was on probation,
was charged with two counts of burglary of a dwelling. The married
woman whose apartment he entered said Collins had been stalking
her. Collins, who was waived by the Dolphins, remains in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City receiver Tamarick Vanover repeatedly has been
mentioned in a federal investigation involving a huge cocaine and
marijuana ring that has been smuggling drugs into Kansas and
Missouri. Vanover hasn't been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chiefs running back Bam Morris was a passenger in a Ford
Expedition that pulled out of Vanover's driveway and was stopped by
police. The Expedition had been stolen. The driver, Morris' friend
and former college teammate, Dewayne Bryant, was charged with
felony theft.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who was on probation, retired from the Chiefs in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina running back Fred Lane's car was stopped. He was
arrested on drug and weapons charges. New York Jets receiver Wayne
Chrebet and Indianapolis fullback Keith Elias were arrested outside
a New Jersey bar at 4 a.m. last Sunday. They had been involved in a
fight that some witnesses described as a melee. Chrebet was charged
with disorderly conduct. Elias was charged with disorderly conduct
and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Many players who get into trouble off the field are involved
with friends or acquaintances, not with teammates. Alcohol or drugs
also can play a role. So can where the players hang out, not just
with whom they hang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendship goes out the window when the law gets involved,''
said former 49ers/Raiders/Jets defensive back Ronnie Lott, who is a
member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2000. ``Many of
the problems guys have are because of people they're surrounded by.
Guys have to understand the law doesn't care if you're with your
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys say, `I'm not going to turn my back on my friends.'
That's a tough thing for other people to understand. I'm not saying
don't hang with old friends. But when a moment of truth comes, you
have to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse, who was voted to
the Pro Bowl, grew up in Fort Myers, Fla. His father was murdered
before he was born. One brother was shot to death. Another brother
is in prison. When Kearse goes home, he's careful to avoid people
and situations that could get him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no proper way to teach people,'' he said. ``Sometimes
it's hard to not associate with the friends you grew up with.
Everybody knows right from wrong, but they don't always do the
right thing. I can be walking down the street with regular Joe
Blows and get into trouble. We have to realize that most people
don't have as much to lose as we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go home, there are some friends I could get in trouble
with if I'm not careful, but I'm careful. I might just drive by
them and say, `What's up?' and keep going. I know that's not a
place for me now, and they pretty much understand it. I've moved on
from that part of my life. If I'm with guys like that and something
goes down, they'll probably just get a slap on the wrist, but it
could ruin my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists who study the NFL say violent behavior off the
field is to be expected because the players are coached to play
violently. Players disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough man's game, but you can't take it home with
you,'' said Tampa Bay safety John Lynch, who is one of the league's
hardest hitters. ``You learn how to separate the two as you get
older. The best way to stay out of trouble is to stay away from
places where trouble can find you.''

   Landry's image belied person
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
He was the man with the Dick Tracy hat and lantern jaw, and a
starched, straight-as-a-steel-rod image. A Dallas cartoonist once
drew a strip with six panels captioned, ``The Many Moods of Tom
Landry.'' In each panel, he wore the same unsmiling, pencil-lipped
expression.
</P>
<P>
   For 29 years, he was the only head coach the Dallas Cowboys had
ever known, and he was the first to be fired. When Landry lost his
battle with leukemia Saturday at twilight, surrounded by his
family, it was not his exit from the team he helped create that you
wanted to remember.
</P>
<P>
   His illness was diagnosed nine months ago, and no one tried to
pretend he had long to live. Yet he went through it pretty much as
he had gone through most things, with dignity and without false
hope or complaint. Landry was 75, and he spent roughly 50 of those
years engaged in football.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Man from Mission, an aptly named town in the Valley.
He went on to become a star fullback at the University of Texas,
and a solid defensive back with the New York Giants, where he began
his coaching career on the same staff as Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't actually give us America's Team; that kind of glitz
and puffery was beneath him. But he gave Cowboys fans the success
and the consistency that made it stick. Even those who rooted
against the Cowboys could not dislike honest Tom Landry. His teams
won 13 division titles and 270 games, including two Super Bowls
(out of five).
</P>
<P>
   His career was not without contradictions. Duane Thomas, then a
young back with a puzzling attitude, described him as a ``plastic
man.'' Don Meredith, the devil-may-care quarterback, once said that
if Landry were in a personality contest with Bud Grant, the
Minnesota coach, there would be no winner.
</P>
<P>
   And Jerry Jones, on his first day as the owner of the franchise,
ushered Landry out the door, suggesting the parade had passed him
by.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had gone three years without a winning record. In
his last season, 1988, they finished with three wins and 13 losses.ndry was far from disheartened. He felt confident he could
turn the team around, as he had done in the beginning, when they
didn't reach the .500 mark until 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Few remember _ why would anyone want to? _ that Dallas was the
only expansion team in NFL history to go into its first season
without the benefit of a college draft.
</P>
<P>
   In what might have been a whimsical mood, he once confided he
thought he had done his best coaching job with his first Cowboys
team. His most vivid memory of that virginal 1960 season was of the
only game the Cowboys didn't lose. They didn't win it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the score,'' he said, ``or whether they came
from behind or we did. I'm not sure if Eddie LeBaron or Don
Meredith was our quarterback. But the game was at Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The pint-sized LeBaron played the whole game and completed four
TD passes, the last to Billy Howton to tie the score at 31 in the
darkening seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way home,'' Landry said, ``we considered it a
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had lost their first 10 games and the tie kept them
from having a perfect record. A week later, they ended the season
by losing to the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they had given the rest of the league a 40-year head
start, the Cowboys lost only four games by more than 12 points. Out
of it came a trend that spread throughout the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much to give us hope,'' Landry said. ``But it
forced us to comb the free-agent ranks and to take a good, hard
look at the all-black schools, something not all the teams had
done. We found the Jethro Pughs and the Rayfield Wrights and, in
time, that made us a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's preference for the dedicated, clean-cut types, the
Roger Staubachs and Bob Lillys and Lee Roy Jordans, was well-known.
But he tolerated the rebels, up to a point, and won with them:
Meredith, Tony Dorsett, Pete Gent, Hollywood Henderson, to offer an
interesting cross section.
</P>
<P>
   Always, the enduring picture of Landry was that of an aloof,
mechanical kind of man, dry as a Santa Clara prune. For sure, he
was not a back-slapper, nor one who needed an audience. He rarely
chose to reveal himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Landry had a dry sense of humor. Once, asked by a
sportswriter what kind of field position he preferred, he replied,
``Frankly, I'm partial to my opponent's one-inch line.''
</P>
<P>
   When he relented during one Super Bowl trip and allowed the
wives to share a hotel room with their husbands, he explained that,
``Everyone enjoys a change now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and taciturn, his face during a game revealed about as much
emotion as a lamp post. Somewhere along the line he became typed as
a conservative coach, but the record doesn't support that label. It
was Landry who revived the shotgun formation for Staubach in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Landry, as an assistant with the Giants in the late
1950s, who invented an alignment called the 4-3 defense. In the
opinion of some pro observers, that accomplishment put him right up
there with Eli Whitney and the cotton gin.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi was the backfield coach under Jim Lee Howell and
Landry, still playing in the secondary, was a coach on the field.
Kyle Rote, who starred as a halfback and receiver, recalls walking
down the hall during training camp, peeking in the office doors,
and seeing Landry in one room running a film projector, and
Lombardi in another room, doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hall, Howell, the head man, was reading a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew then that there was a wonderful competition going
on, perhaps not even Lombardi and Landry. Both would become Hall of
Famers, and legendary figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Frank Gifford, the key back in Lombardi's
run-to-daylight philosophy, ``I learned more playing under Tom and
I don't mean that as a putdown of Vince. Landry taught. Lombardi
inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game against the Redskins, Gifford, playing both ways,
intercepted a pass and was about to be tackled inside the
Washington 10-yard line. As he went down, he spotted Tom out of the
corner of his eye and lateraled to him. A startled Landry loped
over for the touchdown. On the sideline, he chewed out Gifford for
improvising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one I admired more than Tom Landry,'' said
Gifford, who moved on to television and Monday Night Football. ``I
wrote him a letter a couple of years ago and tried to say that. I'm
not much for writing fan letters, but I did it this once. We create
images and we can't erase them. People would mistake his intensity,
his discipline, for coldness. But he was really very special. His
relationship with his wife, Alicia, and his kids, the closeness,
was marvelous to see. He was a great coach and an exemplary
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their corporate image under Landry, the history of the
Cowboys was anything but bland. They were for years a party team in
a fairly decent party town. Old-timers recalled fondly the days
when Meredith walked into the huddle singing a medley of his
favorite country songs. Then the Cowboys started winning, and
Meredith realized he was the only one still singing.
</P>
<P>
   Landry created the flex defense and the Cowboys introduced the
computer to pro football. He had his critics, early and late, but
he tolerated them.
</P>
<P>
   What Thomas Wade Landry couldn't tolerate was losing. He was
clearly bitter when Jones fired him, but at the same time he felt
sympathy for the task that faced the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot harder to start from scratch now,'' he said, ``than
it was in 1960.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was no longer his, and he made an interesting
discovery: ``I never realized how much pressure I was under, until
it wasn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   His place in pro football lore is permanent, and so is the image
of the man in the hat.

   Idolizing Landry was natural for a young fan
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
To a young boy growing up in Waco in the 1960s, Tom Landry was God.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know it's sacrilegious to refer to Landry or any man as
God, but to impressionable kids who loved to eat, drink and sleep
Dallas Cowboys football, he came closer than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Waco was and still is a Cowboys stronghold. For many of us, a
rite of passage was experiencing the thrill of a Cowboys victory
and the agony of their defeat. Tom Landry was the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Landry made an impact on our lives because he was a symbol of
our youth, a role model who transcended football and shaped many of
our beliefs. Landry stood for everything that was good.
</P>
<P>
   During games, Landry's calmness gave us confidence and made us
feel safe. Even if Vince Lombardi or George Allen was on the
opposing sideline, we knew Landry would outfox them and find a way
to lead the Cowboys to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Because Landry had been fighting a gallant and courageous battle
with leukemia, his death Saturday wasn't a surprise. Still, it's so
hard to believe that he will no longer be around.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to the family of Buddy Holly, as far as I'm
concerned, Feb. 25, 1989, was the day the music died. When Landry
was fired that day, I surrendered my allegiance to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   I became a Cowboys fan the moment they were awarded an NFL
expansion team. I've often thought how different the NFL would be
if Landry had accepted the first pro football job he was offered _
by Bud Adams, who owned the Houston Oilers of the fledgling
American Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine how different so many of our lives would have been
if Landry had not politely declined Adams' deal and later accepted
Clint Murchison's offer to become the first coach of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how bitter the defeat or how sweet the victory, Landry
was always the personification of class and dignity. He was easy to
spot because he wore a suit with his trademark hat. No matter what
kind of game the Cowboys played, old stone face never smiled or
frowned.
</P>
<P>
   I suffered through the early years of defeat, then celebrated
when they finally began to win and came tantalizingly close to
winning a championship. But they always fell short, and even though
my faith in the players waned, I always believed in Landry.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I saw Landry in person, I was too nervous to get
close to him. He came to Waco to speak at our church. On Sundays
during football season, I always sat in the back close to the exit
so I could leave a few minutes before noon and run to my
grandmother's house in time for the Cowboys' kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Sunday night in the offseason, I sat closer to the
front but not as close as I had hoped. With Landry in the pulpit,
it was kind of like sitting in the front row at school and being
called on to answer a question. I never sat in the front row at
school, and I guess that night I was afraid that Landry might
actually look at me.
</P>
<P>
   Because Landry was an icon, we were mesmerized by his words, and
transfixed by his stare. I listened intently to every word he said,
but they didn't hit home. Even though his sermon was captivating,
the entire time I watched him, I couldn't help but think about
certain plays and games and wonder what he had been thinking at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I became a sportswriter at the Waco Tribune-Herald
and the Chronicle, I covered some Cowboys games. Even if I was
supposed to be in the opposing dressing room, I still went to
Landry's postgame session just to hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the Ice Bowl and Jim O'Brien still cause nightmares.
No matter how hard I try, I still hate Bart Starr, who is one of
the most likeable and well-respected players in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I go to Lambeau Field to cover a Packers game _ and
I've traveled to Green Bay many times through the years _ I can't
help but remember the Ice Bowl. When Starr sneaked for the winning
touchdown to ruin the Cowboys' season for the second consecutive
year, I thought the Packers were almost superhuman, robots created
in a lab by Lombardi, who, like Landry, was also larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   I've talked to many Packers who played in the Ice Bowl. To this
day, they are extremely humble because they know how fortunate they
were to win a game that is one of the greatest and most memorable
in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, I respect the late George Allen, and I believe he
should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, even though I hated
everything about him for so many years. Even though I like his son,
Raiders executive Bruce Allen, I still have this deep-rooted
resentment for Allen because he was able to do what others couldn't
_ torment Landry and the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Because Landry had been ill for so long, it's comforting to know
that he will not suffer any more. For a while, though, those of us
who admired him and appreciated what he accomplished on and off the
field will suffer without him.

Saint Louis outshoots Houston 82-70
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ This one wasn't in much doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Cougars allowed too many open 3-pointers to a team
that couldn't miss for much of the game and lost to the Saint Louis
Billikens 82-70 Saturday at Kiel Center.
</P>
<P>
   In winning for the seventh time in its last nine starts, Saint
Louis (14-8, 6-4 Conference USA) connected on a season-high 11
treys after virtually eliminating any chance of a UH comeback with
an early wave of 3-pointers before a crowd of 13,247. The Cougars
(8-15, 2-8) sagged too much in their zone defense and paid dearly
at the outset, then couldn't sustain a second-half rally against
the Billikens' man-to-man pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Robertson (3-of-4), Dave Fergerson (2-of-3), Justin Love
(3-of-7), Maurice Jeffers (1-of-1) and freshman Chris Braun
(2-of-2) tormented Houston from long range. Saint Louis has made 27
3-pointers in its last four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were making their 3s against the zone, but they were also
getting open shots in transition and that's unacceptable,'' UH
guard Gee Gervin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin's 3-pointer with 53 seconds remaining kept the Cougars
from going without a trey for the first time in two seasons. Gervin
(23 points on 10-of-18 shooting) and freshman George Williams (20
points on 8-of-11) carried the scoring burden.
</P>
<P>
   Love, a 6-2 senior guard, scored a game-high 25 points for the
Billikens, who received 37 points from their bench, including 10
from Braun and nine from Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played outstanding man defense and took us out of our
offense at times, and we didn't get open 3s most of the day,''
Gervin said. ``They were hitting uncontested shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin and Love entered the game as the league's top two scorers
and ended the day in a virtual tie, with Gervin at 19.3 points a
game and Love at 19.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played great defense and shot it well. They had
everything going for them,'' UH coach Clyde Drexler said. ``They
had some open shots and knocked them down when we went to our
halfcourt trap. Lorenzo Romar (SLU's first-year coach) is doing a
great job, and they're definitely going to the (NCAA) Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Billikens, No. 43 in the latest Ratings Percentage Index,
are tied for second in the C-USA's American Division.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule doesn't get any easier for the Cougars, who have
lost five in a row and 10 of the past 12 games. Next up is a
Thursday night game at Hofheinz Pavilion against No. 1 Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Louis got an early lift by making five of its first seven
3-pointers, which helped expand a 20-16 lead to 32-20 midway
through the first half. The Billikens shot 7-for-10 from long range
and took a 44-32 lead to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Love helped Saint Louis widen the gap when he hit a pair of 3s
and scored nine points in an 11-4 run that gave the Billikens a
55-36 lead only 3:21 into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Louis' margin swelled to 62-41 before UH's trapping
defense helped cut the lead to 64-51. But after Redden scored in
the lane, Love cashed in off a loose ball and Braun connected on
two consecutive baskets, and the Billikens were back on top 72-53
with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't shoot well this season for a long time,'' Romar said
of his team, which was hitting 44.4 percent for the season. ``I
don't like talking about it because who knows what will happen
next?''

   Violence has forced NFL out of bounds
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Violent acts by NFL players this season created so much controversy
that critics are calling it the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day it seems as if another player is being charged
with a crime, making the league a convenient target for criticism
from those who believe the owners are more concerned with making
money than cleansing the NFL of the criminal element that provides
a bad role model for the youth of America.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's public relations machine counters with statistics that
show the percentage of crimes committed by players is less than
society in general. The league contends that because the NFL is so
popular, it is going to be under the microscope more than other
industries and that everything is going to be magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've definitely got to be careful in this league,''
Jacksonville offensive tackle Leon Searcy said. ``Any time we do
something, it's public. Association brings on assimilation. The
people you associate with can put a damper on your reputation.
We've got to be careful about who we hang out with. We've got to
let them know, `When you do something, it reflects on me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Players have to avoid those situations and learn not to get
involved in circumstances that lead to consequences. Everything you
do is going to be magnified by 100, whether you're innocent or
guilty. And you're going to be perceived as guilty until proven
innocent because of your stature. It's unfortunate, (but) we know
coming into the NFL that we have to use better judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of NFL players are being branded by the actions of
a few, which doesn't sit well with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of players who aren't involved in anything
illegal or violent,'' Buffalo guard Ruben Brown said. ``That should
let you know there isn't some trait in a football player to be that
type of violent person society knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who don't play football commit those crimes.
To think we're exempt is ridiculous. We're no different from the
rest of society in that some of us are good and some of us are bad.
Just because we play football doesn't mean we're going to run
around killing people or doing things of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime is not new in the NFL. Former Carolina receiver
Rae Carruth wasn't the first player to be charged with committing a
murder during the season. In 1951, Pittsburgh Steelers receiver
Jerry Nuzum was arrested for allegedly murdering a waitress in New
Mexico. A judge dismissed the case for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Murder accusations get the attention of the news media, not just
the sports media. It also attracts the interest of non-sports fans.
The media fuel interest.
</P>
<P>
   When Carruth was charged with first-degree murder in the
shooting death of his girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time, it
received worldwide publicity. She died, but the baby lived.
</P>
<P>
   When Baltimore middle linebacker Ray Lewis, who had been voted
as a starter in the Pro Bowl, was charged with double murder
resulting from a fight outside an Atlanta nightclub after Super
Bowl XXXIV, interest skyrocketed. And the media feeding frenzy
began.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carruth, Lewis remains in jail. Many have an opinion about
why they are there and what they could have done to avoid their
situations, but Cleveland Browns owner Al Lerner might have put it
best.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Lewis, Lerner said: ``He was trained to be a great
athlete. He was never trained to be a multimillionaire. He was
never trained to handle that kind of exposure and the things that
got shoved in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do we remember walking away from an incident
and it was good that we did? These kids may not know enough about
just walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams have programs to educate and help players.
Psychologists and doctors participate in the programs, which cost
each team about $1 million a year to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis plays for the Ravens, who had a seven-part lecture series
during the last offseason on how players should conduct themselves.
Topics covered in the series involved drug counseling,
accountability both personally and professionally, and
relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate and we don't condone misconduct,'' NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``We do strike a balance between
that and giving people a second chance, recognizing that some of
the misconduct by NFL players has occurred before they were NFL
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have in place a very comprehensive, very active set of
programs, and they focus on prevention, and they are all tied
together. We have counseling on a league-wide basis. We have
treatment. We have prevention and we have discipline, and I think
the players respond in a very positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not. Can we
predict when a player such as Rae Carruth is going to have a
problem? Of course not. We can't predict that any more than others
in society can predict that students are going to shoot other
students or that workers are going to shoot other workers in the
workplace. You can't predict when there is going to be aberrant
behavior. Nor can you understand it after it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL players have been involved in many other recent incidents,
but fans have become almost immune to them.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Indianapolis defensive back Steve Muhammad was
charged with battery in the beating of his pregnant wife. He was
cleared in the deaths of his wife and stillborn child that resulted
from a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Miami rookie running back Cecil Collins, who was on probation,
was charged with two counts of burglary of a dwelling. The married
woman whose apartment he entered said Collins had been stalking
her. Collins, who was waived by the Dolphins, remains in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City receiver Tamarick Vanover repeatedly has been
mentioned in a federal investigation involving a huge cocaine and
marijuana ring that has been smuggling drugs into Kansas and
Missouri. Vanover hasn't been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chiefs running back Bam Morris was a passenger in a Ford
Expedition that pulled out of Vanover's driveway and was stopped by
police. The Expedition had been stolen. The driver, Morris' friend
and former college teammate, Dewayne Bryant, was charged with
felony theft.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who was on probation, retired from the Chiefs in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina running back Fred Lane's car was stopped. He was
arrested on drug and weapons charges. New York Jets receiver Wayne
Chrebet and Indianapolis fullback Keith Elias were arrested outside
a New Jersey bar at 4 a.m. last Sunday. They had been involved in a
fight that some witnesses described as a melee. Chrebet was charged
with disorderly conduct. Elias was charged with disorderly conduct
and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Many players who get into trouble off the field are involved
with friends or acquaintances, not with teammates. Alcohol or drugs
also can play a role. So can where the players hang out, not just
with whom they hang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendship goes out the window when the law gets involved,''
said former 49ers/Raiders/Jets defensive back Ronnie Lott, who is a
member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2000. ``Many of
the problems guys have are because of people they're surrounded by.
Guys have to understand the law doesn't care if you're with your
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys say, `I'm not going to turn my back on my friends.'
That's a tough thing for other people to understand. I'm not saying
don't hang with old friends. But when a moment of truth comes, you
have to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City tight end Tony Gonzalez said it's easier said than
done for players to disassociate themselves with friends they grew
up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize these players have grown up with those
guys since they were little kids,'' he said. ``You can tell them to
change, but it's hard to do. These are the people who were there
before you became who you are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell someone like that, `Hey, I can't hang out
with you anymore. Even though you've been with me my whole life,
now I can't talk to you anymore.' I mean, that's a hard position to
be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse, who was voted to
the Pro Bowl, grew up in Fort Myers, Fla. His father was murdered
before he was born. One brother was shot to death. Another brother
is in prison. When Kearse goes home, he's careful to avoid people
and situations that could get him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no proper way to teach people,'' he said. ``Sometimes
it's hard to not associate with the friends you grew up with.
Everybody knows right from wrong, but they don't always do the
right thing. I can be walking down the street with regular Joe
Blows and get into trouble. We have to realize that most people
don't have as much to lose as we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go home, there are some friends I could get in trouble
with if I'm not careful, but I'm careful. I might just drive by
them and say, `What's up?' and keep going. I know that's not a
place for me now, and they pretty much understand it. I've moved on
from that part of my life. If I'm with guys like that and something
goes down, they'll probably just get a slap on the wrist, but it
could ruin my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists who study the NFL say violent behavior off the
field is to be expected because the players are coached to play
violently. Players disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough man's game, but you can't take it home with
you,'' said Tampa Bay safety John Lynch, who is one of the league's
hardest hitters. ``You learn how to separate the two as you get
older. The best way to stay out of trouble is to stay away from
places where trouble can find you.''

   Legendary Dallas Cowboys coach Landry dies
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Tom Landry, who built the Dallas Cowboys into America's Team and
guided them to five Super Bowls during his 29-year coaching career,
died Saturday after a lengthy battle with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, 75, had been undergoing treatment since May for acute
myelogenous leukemia, a form of cancer that produces abnormal
growth of blood cells. He died at 6 p.m. at Baylor University
Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, whose 270 victories are third on the NFL's all-time list
behind Don Shula and George Halas, was surrounded by his family,
including Alicia, his wife of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shaped my philosophy on everything,'' said Atlanta Falcons
coach Dan Reeves, who played and coached for Landry before
embarking on his first head coaching job at Denver. ``I followed
his philosophy on football and how he handled himself on and off
the field. He was a tremendous influence on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was something unique to the NFL. He was someone who had
tremendous knowledge of the NFL, but he was also a man of such
integrity. He had a strong Christian faith that was unusual at that
time. And he didn't just talk it. He walked it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry, a member of Pro Football Hall of Fame, was the Cowboys'
first coach, hired by owner Clint Murchison in 1960. Landry,
general manager Tex Schramm and personnel director Gil Brandt spent
almost 30 years together helping the Cowboys become the most
popular team in NFL history. During their tenure, the Cowboys won
two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the epitome of fairness, honesty, integrity and
all the virtues and values people talk about,'' said Mike Ditka,
who played and coached under Landry before becoming a head coach
with Chicago and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Landry's death wasn't a surprise, the Metroplex will be
in mourning over a coach who changed the lives of fans, players,
coaches and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Landry's familiar presence on the Dallas Cowboys' sideline
for three decades represented the NFL at its best,'' NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``He will always rank as one of
the all-time great coaches and as an architect of one of the most
successful teams in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be remembered for many special reasons, including his
record as a coach, the innovations he brought to our game, and the
personal integrity he displayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's teams posted a league-record 20 consecutive winning
seasons and won 13 division titles, but after suffering three
losing seasons in a row, he was fired in 1989 when Jerry Jones
bought the team from Bum Bright. Jimmy Johnson replaced Landry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never be able to measure the complete significance of
coach Landry's contributions to the Dallas Cowboys,'' Jones said.
``Simply stated, he's the single most important figure in the
history of this franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's unemotional, stone-faced sideline demeanor belied his
uncanny ability to create and innovate, but few coaches in pro
football history contributed more to the way the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, who grew up in Mission, Texas, and played at the
University of Texas, was an outstanding defensive back for the New
York Giants. He was the Giants' defensive coordinator when
Murchison hired him to coach Dallas' expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Landry was credited with developing the 4-3
defense and, in essence, created the middle linebacker position.
Later, he developed the read-and-react flex defense that was the
foundation of the Cowboys' ``Doomsday Defenses'' of the 1970s and
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Landry used the quarterback shuffle in the 1960s.
He installed the spread formation and was one of the first coaches
to use the shotgun. He loved gimmick plays, too. Two of his
favorites were the halfback option pass and the throwback play in
which the halfback took the handoff and lateraled back to the
quarterback, who threw downfield.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was the first coach to have his offensive linemen raise
up before they were set, a movement that he said caused the
defensive players problems with sight adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole Cowboys image came from him,'' said former
quarterback Roger Staubach. ``I think Tom will always make the
Dallas Cowboys more than a football team.``
</P>
<P>
   When Staubach was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in
1985, he asked Landry to present him. When Landry was inducted in
1990, he asked Staubach to present him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was somewhat of a shyness about him, but he was always
there when you needed him,'' Staubach said. ``I don't know anyone
who didn't have respect for him as a person. As a human being,
coach Landry is right there among the very best. There was nothing
phony about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's record with the Cowboys was 270-178-6 (.601 winning
percentage). However, his first team went 0-11-1, and after four
years the Cowboys were 13-38-3. Fans and media members wanted him
fired, but Murchison showed his support by signing Landry to a
10-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt found the players, and Landry coached them. Schramm
handled the business and promotional side of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally different,'' Schramm said. ``We were never
close socially, but we got along very well because he had his
domain and we each knew where the lines were. I respected him, he
respected me and things worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry was a devoted Christian who promoted the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes, among other organizations. After he was fired,
he remained in the background and didn't attend Cowboys games
except when he was inducted into the Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium
in 1993. Rather than a player's jersey number, a small hat is
displayed beside his name and the years he coached (1960-88).
</P>
<P>
   When Dallas had a ``Hats Off to Tom Landry Day,'' that featured
a parade, an estimated crowd of 100,000 showed up to cheer him.
That day, Landry let down his guard and show some rare emotion. He
called it the ``most exciting and meaningful'' day in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you played for him, he was the boss,'' said Ditka, who
played for four years and coached nine years under Landry. ``When I
coached for him he was the boss, too, but when you played for him
there was a fear in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to be more like him, but I'm an emotional
person and I can't be what I'm not. To be that stoic and that under
control and that disciplined is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Landry was criticized by some of his players.
Former receiver Pete Gent wrote North Dallas Forty, which became a
popular film starring Nick Nolte. In the book and film, a character
based on Landry was portrayed as an unfeeling, uncaring coach whose
philosophy was to win at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Former running back Duane Thomas also took shots at Landry, who
never responded because he remained above it all.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1980s, Landry eased up and drew positive
attention for television commercials. His most famous was an
American Express ad that poked fun at the Cowboys-Washington
Redskins rivalry, which was the hottest in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys didn't have a winning season until 1966, when they
lost the championship to Green Bay, which continued on to win Super
Bowl I.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, the Cowboys defeated Cleveland for their first
playoff victory, which gained them a revenge game against the
Packers. In one of the most famous games in NFL history, the
Cowboys visited Lambeau Field for what became known as the Ice
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr scored on a quarterback sneak
for the winning touchdown with 13 seconds left and a 21-17 victory.
The Packers went on to win a second consecutive Super Bowl for
Vince Lombardi, who was an assistant coach with Landry with the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that call, the sneak,'' Landry said at the
time. ``It wasn't a good call. But now, it's a great call.''
</P>
<P>
   The next two seasons the Cowboys were eliminated from the
playoffs by Cleveland. They reached their first Super Bowl but lost
in January 1971 to Baltimore on Jim O'Brien's field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Landry finally won his first Super Bowl the next season when the
Cowboys defeated Miami 24-3. Landry's players carried him off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see that image of him being carried off the field,''
Staubach said. ``I think that was a big deal to him, the best in
his life. Seeing that smile on his face showed how happy he was to
finally get over that hump.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Hey, buddy, watch that cup of coffee. Whoa! Hate to tell you
this, but that brown splatter really stands out on the floral tie.
How much did that thing set you back? Seventy-five bucks? Ouch.
Great suit too. Worsted wool, eh? Hey, did you run all the way to
the office today _ I mean, you can't ignore those dark sweat marks
creeping down the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   That was yesterday. Tomorrow, embarrassing _ and expensive _
clothing disasters will be history, because textile designers are
teaming up with materials scientists to develop fabrics that remain
fresh and wearable regardless of what you spill on them.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar cottons, wools and polyesters are getting face-lifts
from the atoms up. No longer will clothes simply adorn the body and
passively shield it from the elements. Fabrics are being coached,
molecule by molecule, to engage with their environments, to get in
the ring with odor, bacteria, heat, cold and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Take that tie stain. Actually, don't take that stain. Buy a tie
with Teflon. The slippery polymer from DuPont is also making its
way into jackets, shirts and almost anything wearable.
</P>
<P>
   What once kept burned grease from sticking to frying pans has
been modified to protect individual fibers. The resulting fabrics
lose little in the fashion jungle, judging from their appearance in
the windows of Hugo Boss and Prada, and they slice dry-cleaning
bills in half.
</P>
<P>
   A stickier problem is the damage the body itself inflicts on
clothes. Sweating is a human's clumsy attempt to adjust to everyday
temperature swings. Textile engineers are working to create
so-called phase-change fabrics that keep the body perpetually
comfortable and sweat-free.
</P>
<P>
   A waxy compound developed a decade ago changes from a solid to a
liquid when heated and then slowly releases that heat and changes
back into a solid when cooled _ like H2O changing from ice to water
to ice.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the U.S. Air Force planned to put this material into
gloves to keep pilots' hands warm, but the idea fell prey to budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based entrepreneurs Bernie Perry and Ed Payne purchased
patent rights for the compound and, after years of testing,
supplied retail stores with hiking boots lined with cloth permeated
with tiny capsules of the phase-change wax. Their material,
manufactured under the name Outlast, is being made into things like
socks, which keep feet within a comfortable 10-degree-variable
temperature zone.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated phase-change fabrics are on the way. Research
scientist Tyrone Vigo of the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent
the last decade developing a polymer called polyethylene glycol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polymer looks like a helix,''he says. ``It coils and
uncoils and acts like a thermal spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Outlast fabric, clothing impregnated with Vigo's
phase-change molecules keeps the wearer at a steady temperature.
</P>
<P>
   But temperature control is only the beginning. Vigo's versatile
material performs other tricks that come in handy when things turn
sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polyethylene glycol has a lot of hydrogen and oxygen, so it's
hydrophilic, or water loving,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When the molecule's thermal spring encounters damp heat _
perspiration, for example _ it uncoils, trapping the warmth, and
draws water away from the skin. If a cool breeze comes up and a
wearer stops perspiring, the spring reacts and coils, releasing
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric can be formulated to maintain a range of
temperatures, kicking into action only if conditions get too hot or
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a cost-effective process for bonding polyethylene
glycol to fabric took years. But now it's show time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lister, president of Wisconsin Global Technologies, has
leased Vigo's patent on the material and confidently predicts the
polymer-coated fabric will be on store shelves within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lister breathlessly rattles off the virtues of clothing
containing the miracle molecule: ``Nontoxic, antimicrobial,
eliminates all odor-causing microbes, antistatic, antiwrinkle and
there's no shrinkage.''
</P>
<P>
   The elasticity of the molecules makes all fabrics tougher and
wrinkle resistant, while the molecules' tendency to soak up water
diffuses static charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Global Technologies' spin-off company, ThermoSense,
has begun manufacturing prototypes of phase-change slippers and
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Those springlike polyethylene glycol molecules will be a boon
for the medical industry as well. For reasons still not totally
understood, microorganisms cannot survive on fabrics treated with
the polymer. Perhaps the water-loving molecules make the clothing
so dry that bacteria cannot survive, or more likely the molecules
alter fabric fibers so that bacteria cannot attach themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Artley, president of Bayshore Holdings in New York City,
doesn't care; he's just happy to exploit the combination of
absorbency and antibacterial activity. Possibilities include
bandages that stop infection, and scrubs to protect doctors from
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on making bedding, blankets, footwear, wound-care
dressings and incontinence products,'' Artley says.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is reviewing the products. And there's more than one way
to engineer killer clothing. HaloSource in Seattle developed a
process to incorporate N-halamines, compounds used in swimming
pools to stabilize chlorine, into clothing fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching N-halamines to cotton gives chlorine atoms something
to hang on to and then, just as in a swimming pool, the chlorine
kills germs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, HaloSource's process will hit the market in
chlorine-engineered socks, diapers, bandages, medical uniforms and
air filters. When a garment begins to lose its potency, it can be
washed in chlorine bleach for a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acordis Acrylic Fibers in Bradford, England, has
engineered a fabric that targets other pests _ like those found in
a bed. Typically, a person shares an evening of rest with 2 million
dust mites, microscopic critters that feed off human skin cells and
cause health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Acordis' team of entomologists, chemists and materials
scientists came up with a surprising twist on acrylic fabrics. To
kill dust mites, the textile needed to take down the middleman, the
fungus Aspergillus repens, which breaks down flakes of human skin
into dust-mite meals. The company found a way to get acrylic fibers
to absorb a slow-release chemical that stops the fungus from
reproducing. Without the fungus, the mites eventually starve.
</P>
<P>
   Even more advanced engineered clothing will emerge from devices
that assemble textiles atom by atom. Such nano-technology mills
could completely transform how fabric is made.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would giant factories turn out hundreds of tons of
cloth a day. Instead, says materials engineer David Forrest,
president of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, nano-mills
will spit out custom fabrics from contraptions the size of
photocopy machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw materials such as nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen will be
put into a desk-size unit,'' Forrest explains, ``which will
rearrange the elements and control the trajectories of all the
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   What's he got in mind? Clothing that incorporates sensors to
detect rips and tears, alerting paramecium-size robotic crews to
execute repairs by means of the same atomic manipulation used to
make the garment in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What will they think of next?

<P>
   Hey, buddy, watch that cup of coffee. Whoa! Hate to tell you
this, but that brown splatter really stands out on the floral tie.
How much did that thing set you back? Seventy-five bucks? Ouch.
Great suit too. Worsted wool, eh? Hey, did you run all the way to
the office today _ I mean, you can't ignore those dark sweat marks
creeping down the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   That was yesterday. Tomorrow, embarrassing _ and expensive _
clothing disasters will be history, because textile designers are
teaming up with materials scientists to develop fabrics that remain
fresh and wearable regardless of what you spill on them.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar cottons, wools and polyesters are getting face-lifts
from the atoms up. No longer will clothes simply adorn the body and
passively shield it from the elements. Fabrics are being coached,
molecule by molecule, to engage with their environments, to get in
the ring with odor, bacteria, heat, cold and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Take that tie stain. Actually, don't take that stain. Buy a tie
with Teflon. The slippery polymer from DuPont is also making its
way into jackets, shirts and almost anything wearable.
</P>
<P>
   What once kept burned grease from sticking to frying pans has
been modified to protect individual fibers. The resulting fabrics
lose little in the fashion jungle, judging from their appearance in
the windows of Hugo Boss and Prada, and they slice dry-cleaning
bills in half.
</P>
<P>
   A stickier problem is the damage the body itself inflicts on
clothes. Sweating is a human's clumsy attempt to adjust to everyday
temperature swings. Textile engineers are working to create
so-called phase-change fabrics that keep the body perpetually
comfortable and sweat-free.
</P>
<P>
   A waxy compound developed a decade ago changes from a solid to a
liquid when heated and then slowly releases that heat and changes
back into a solid when cooled _ like H2O changing from ice to water
to ice.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the U.S. Air Force planned to put this material into
gloves to keep pilots' hands warm, but the idea fell prey to budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based entrepreneurs Bernie Perry and Ed Payne purchased
patent rights for the compound and, after years of testing,
supplied retail stores with hiking boots lined with cloth permeated
with tiny capsules of the phase-change wax. Their material,
manufactured under the name Outlast, is being made into things like
socks, which keep feet within a comfortable 10-degree-variable
temperature zone.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated phase-change fabrics are on the way. Research
scientist Tyrone Vigo of the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent
the last decade developing a polymer called polyethylene glycol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polymer looks like a helix,''he says. ``It coils and
uncoils and acts like a thermal spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Outlast fabric, clothing impregnated with Vigo's
phase-change molecules keeps the wearer at a steady temperature.
</P>
<P>
   But temperature control is only the beginning. Vigo's versatile
material performs other tricks that come in handy when things turn
sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polyethylene glycol has a lot of hydrogen and oxygen, so it's
hydrophilic, or water loving,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When the molecule's thermal spring encounters damp heat _
perspiration, for example _ it uncoils, trapping the warmth, and
draws water away from the skin. If a cool breeze comes up and a
wearer stops perspiring, the spring reacts and coils, releasing
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric can be formulated to maintain a range of
temperatures, kicking into action only if conditions get too hot or
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a cost-effective process for bonding polyethylene
glycol to fabric took years. But now it's show time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lister, president of Wisconsin Global Technologies, has
leased Vigo's patent on the material and confidently predicts the
polymer-coated fabric will be on store shelves within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lister breathlessly rattles off the virtues of clothing
containing the miracle molecule: ``Nontoxic, antimicrobial,
eliminates all odor-causing microbes, antistatic, antiwrinkle and
there's no shrinkage.''
</P>
<P>
   The elasticity of the molecules makes all fabrics tougher and
wrinkle resistant, while the molecules' tendency to soak up water
diffuses static charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Global Technologies' spin-off company, ThermoSense,
has begun manufacturing prototypes of phase-change slippers and
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Those springlike polyethylene glycol molecules will be a boon
for the medical industry as well. For reasons still not totally
understood, microorganisms cannot survive on fabrics treated with
the polymer. Perhaps the water-loving molecules make the clothing
so dry that bacteria cannot survive, or more likely the molecules
alter fabric fibers so that bacteria cannot attach themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Artley, president of Bayshore Holdings in New York City,
doesn't care; he's just happy to exploit the combination of
absorbency and antibacterial activity. Possibilities include
bandages that stop infection, and scrubs to protect doctors from
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on making bedding, blankets, footwear, wound-care
dressings and incontinence products,'' Artley says.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is reviewing the products. And there's more than one way
to engineer killer clothing. HaloSource in Seattle developed a
process to incorporate N-halamines, compounds used in swimming
pools to stabilize chlorine, into clothing fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching N-halamines to cotton gives chlorine atoms something
to hang on to and then, just as in a swimming pool, the chlorine
kills germs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, HaloSource's process will hit the market in
chlorine-engineered socks, diapers, bandages, medical uniforms and
air filters. When a garment begins to lose its potency, it can be
washed in chlorine bleach for a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acordis Acrylic Fibers in Bradford, England, has
engineered a fabric that targets other pests _ like those found in
a bed. Typically, a person shares an evening of rest with 2 million
dust mites, microscopic critters that feed off human skin cells and
cause health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Acordis' team of entomologists, chemists and materials
scientists came up with a surprising twist on acrylic fabrics. To
kill dust mites, the textile needed to take down the middleman, the
fungus Aspergillus repens, which breaks down flakes of human skin
into dust-mite meals. The company found a way to get acrylic fibers
to absorb a slow-release chemical that stops the fungus from
reproducing. Without the fungus, the mites eventually starve.
</P>
<P>
   Even more advanced engineered clothing will emerge from devices
that assemble textiles atom by atom. Such nano-technology mills
could completely transform how fabric is made.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would giant factories turn out hundreds of tons of
cloth a day. Instead, says materials engineer David Forrest,
president of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, nano-mills
will spit out custom fabrics from contraptions the size of
photocopy machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw materials such as nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen will be
put into a desk-size unit,'' Forrest explains, ``which will
rearrange the elements and control the trajectories of all the
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   What's he got in mind? Clothing that incorporates sensors to
detect rips and tears, alerting paramecium-size robotic crews to
execute repairs by means of the same atomic manipulation used to
make the garment in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What will they think of next?

<P>
   Every year, Hans-Joachim Pachur leaves his office in a pleasant
villa opposite the Berlin botanical garden and catches a plane for
Libya. In Tripoli he meets up with several colleagues and gets
ready for the desert.
</P>
<P>
   A geographer at the Free University of Berlin, Pachur has been
exploring the Sahara for the last quarter century. He and his team
are on a mission to find evidence that this barren land once
contained substantial amounts of water.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, in the Murzuq Sand Sea of southwestern Libya, Pachur
found animal bones as well as windblown ridges of lake-bed chalk _
evidence that the region had been dotted with bodies of freshwater.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago in the northern Sudan, Pachur found traces of a lake
that may have been as large as Erie. In that same region he traced
the course of a river that once flowed east into the upper Nile. He
has found other rivers that flowed from the Tibesti Mountains 600
miles north to the Mediterranean Sea, through the core of the
Sahara. That region now gets less than two-tenths of an inch of
rain each year.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lost rivers, between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago,
giraffes munched on acacia trees and hippos wallowed in mud. And
people lived there too. Pachur believes the Sahara then was an
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not experience this region the way we do, as a
hostile environment,'' he says. ``For them, it provided enormous
possibilities to blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the climate began to change, and the desert came. It
began sometime after 6,000 years ago. Within just a few centuries,
a gentle, fertile region the size of the United States was
transformed into one of the harshest places on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Saharans had to leave. Many must have migrated east into the
valley of the Nile, their closest source of water. That exodus,
some archaeologists think, may be the event that triggered the rise
of the pharaohs in Egypt a little more than 5,000 years ago. Eden
gave way to one of the planet's first great civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or catastrophe, the birth of the Sahara was not an act
of God. At the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, just
outside Berlin, a theoretical climatologist named Martin Claussen
and his graduate student Claudia Kubatzki have recently been able
to re-create the desert-building process on a computer. They say
that ultimately what keeps rain from falling on the Sahara is a
lack of plants _ which is not as paradoxical as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, who uses Pachur's data to anchor his model to reality,
has never been to the Sahara. But then he has never been to Jupiter
either, and in a way that's the starting point for any attempt to
explain the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's gravity and Venus' gravity pulls on Earth, causing our
planet to tilt on its axis to varying degrees. The tilt is what
gives Earth seasons: Summer happens in the northern hemisphere when
it is tilted toward the sun. The sun's zenith during this period
reaches as far north as the tropic of Cancer, which at present runs
through the Gilf Kebir and the southern edge of the Murzuq. That
latitude, 23.5 degrees, is the present tilt angle.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of a 41,000-year cycle, the tilt and the
tropic get as high as 24.5 and as low as 22.1 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   While Jupiter and Venus are tilting the Earth's axis, the sun
and moon are causing it to wobble like a top; that changes the time
of perihelion, the point on Earth's elliptical orbit at which the
planet comes closest to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Together these two cycles _ along with even slower perturbations
in the shape of the orbit _ determine how much sunlight falls on a
given latitude at a given season. They are called Milankovitch
cycles, after the Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who
proposed in the 1930s that such regularly occurring variations
could explain why Earth's climate goes in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory, the most recent ice sheets began
retreating from Canada and Eurasia around 17,000 years ago because
that's when the northern hemisphere started getting enough sun
during the summer to melt them.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 years ago, the northern sunlight curve was reaching
a peak; climatologists call this period the Holocene Optimum. The
axial tilt was higher than it is now, around 24 degrees, and
perihelion was in July. Both factors made for especially hot
northern summers and _ though it may seem surprising _ for a
greener Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ice age, the Sahara was a desert. But as the
summers got hotter, they also got wetter. During the summer, the
African landmass heats up more than the adjacent Atlantic, and that
temperature contrast drives the monsoon: as hot air rises up and
away over the land, moist winds flow northeast from the Gulf of
Guinea to replace it. Hotter summers mean a stronger monsoon that
brings more rainfall farther north, into the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that has been the whole explanation for why the
desert once bloomed _ but it just doesn't work, Claussen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to reproduce that process in a computer-model
atmosphere, the results are disappointing,'' he says. ``You end up
with a Sahara desert more or less where it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit more rain does fall on the desert, but not nearly enough
to support abundant vegetation or to create lakes. A few years ago,
Claussen had a hunch: Maybe the Sahara wasn't turning green in the
models simply because the models, unlike reality, weren't letting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Every gardener knows, he says, that climate zones dictate what
plants can grow where. But what about the reverse process _ might
vegetation have an influence on climate? In short, yes.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two ways in which vegetation itself might
procure the rainfall it needs. First, ground covered by plants is
darker than a desert; if you look at satellite images, the Sahara
is the brightest feature on Earth after the polar ice caps. It
reflects away as much as 40 percent of the sunlight it receives and
sends most of the rest right back into space, through cloudless
skies, as infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies get fried in the Sahara, but as far as the
atmosphere is concerned, the desert is a net cold source _ and so
most of the time air flows into the region at high altitude and
sinks, forming a dry region of high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If there were enough plants there, darkened ground would absorb
more sunlight, the atmosphere above the plants would be heated, and
the warm air would rise _ which is a prerequisite for clouds and
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The other prerequisite, of course, is water. Plant-covered soil
is invariably wetter than desert sand. When moist soil absorbs
sunlight, the water evaporates. In the atmosphere it condenses
again, releasing energy that fuels updrafts, and thereby forms
clouds. The clouds rain, returning water to the soil. The updrafts
strengthen the monsoon, pulling in more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop,'' Claussen
says.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues at Potsdam, Claussen developed a model that
incorporated this positive feedback. They turned its clock back to
9,000 years ago, and started it running with the sunlight
distribution prescribed for that date by Milankovitch, and lo! they
got a Sahara savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen let the model keep running. The positive feedback works
as well in reverse. By 6,000 years ago, Earth's axis was tilting
less than it had been, heading toward its current angle, and
perihelion was heading out of northern summer and toward winter.
Northern summers were getting cooler, the African monsoon a bit
weaker, and the vegetation in the savanna sparser.
</P>
<P>
   All this was happening very gradually; the orbital cycles are
subtle. But at some point _ in Claussen's model it was around 5,500
years ago _ the system crossed a threshold: the feedback kicked in.
Enough vegetation had been lost from the Sahara, enough bare ground
exposed, that precipitation declined sharply and barrenness began
to spread like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly things went downhill very rapidly,'' Claussen says.
Within a few centuries the cool moist soil had become sand.
</P>
<P>
   If we followed the Milankovitch clock, we would need to pass
through another ice age before the Sahara turned green again, but
we're not sticking to that timetable. Global warming caused by
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, a century or two
from now, provide the nudge to the monsoon that the tilt and wobble
of Earth's axis did in the middle Holocene.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen's model suggests it's possible, though he doesn't much
like to talk about it. The real message of his simulations, he
says, is that feedbacks in Earth's climate have in the past
produced abrupt climate changes that disrupted human societies
tremendously _ and we're not yet capable of predicting which
changes lie in our future. &QL;

   ``Suddenly things went downhill very rapidly,'' Claussen says.
Within a few centuries the cool moist soil had become sand.
</P>
<P>
   If we followed the Milankovitch clock, we would need to pass
through another ice age before the Sahara turned green again, but
we're not sticking to that timetable. Global warming caused by
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, a century or two
from now, provide the nudge to the monsoon that the tilt and wobble
of Earth's axis did in the middle Holocene.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen's model suggests it's possible, though he doesn't much
like to talk about it. The real message of his simulations, he
says, is that feedbacks in Earth's climate have in the past
produced abrupt climate changes that disrupted human societies
tremendously _ and we're not yet capable of predicting which
changes lie in our future. &QL;

   Hey, buddy, watch that cup of coffee. Whoa! Hate to tell you
this, but that brown splatter really stands out on the floral tie.
How much did that thing set you back? Seventy-five bucks? Ouch.
Great suit too. Worsted wool, eh? Hey, did you run all the way to
the office today _ I mean, you can't ignore those dark sweat marks
creeping down the pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   That was yesterday. Tomorrow, embarrassing _ and expensive _
clothing disasters will be history, because textile designers are
teaming up with materials scientists to develop fabrics that remain
fresh and wearable regardless of what you spill on them.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar cottons, wools and polyesters are getting face-lifts
from the atoms up. No longer will clothes simply adorn the body and
passively shield it from the elements. Fabrics are being coached,
molecule by molecule, to engage with their environments, to get in
the ring with odor, bacteria, heat, cold and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Take that tie stain. Actually, don't take that stain. Buy a tie
with Teflon. The slippery polymer from DuPont is also making its
way into jackets, shirts and almost anything wearable.
</P>
<P>
   What once kept burned grease from sticking to frying pans has
been modified to protect individual fibers. The resulting fabrics
lose little in the fashion jungle, judging from their appearance in
the windows of Hugo Boss and Prada, and they slice dry-cleaning
bills in half.
</P>
<P>
   A stickier problem is the damage the body itself inflicts on
clothes. Sweating is a human's clumsy attempt to adjust to everyday
temperature swings. Textile engineers are working to create
so-called phase-change fabrics that keep the body perpetually
comfortable and sweat-free.
</P>
<P>
   A waxy compound developed a decade ago changes from a solid to a
liquid when heated and then slowly releases that heat and changes
back into a solid when cooled _ like H2O changing from ice to water
to ice.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and the U.S. Air Force planned to put this material into
gloves to keep pilots' hands warm, but the idea fell prey to budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado-based entrepreneurs Bernie Perry and Ed Payne purchased
patent rights for the compound and, after years of testing,
supplied retail stores with hiking boots lined with cloth permeated
with tiny capsules of the phase-change wax. Their material,
manufactured under the name Outlast, is being made into things like
socks, which keep feet within a comfortable 10-degree-variable
temperature zone.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated phase-change fabrics are on the way. Research
scientist Tyrone Vigo of the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent
the last decade developing a polymer called polyethylene glycol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polymer looks like a helix,''he says. ``It coils and
uncoils and acts like a thermal spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Outlast fabric, clothing impregnated with Vigo's
phase-change molecules keeps the wearer at a steady temperature.
</P>
<P>
   But temperature control is only the beginning. Vigo's versatile
material performs other tricks that come in handy when things turn
sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polyethylene glycol has a lot of hydrogen and oxygen, so it's
hydrophilic, or water loving,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When the molecule's thermal spring encounters damp heat _
perspiration, for example _ it uncoils, trapping the warmth, and
draws water away from the skin. If a cool breeze comes up and a
wearer stops perspiring, the spring reacts and coils, releasing
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric can be formulated to maintain a range of
temperatures, kicking into action only if conditions get too hot or
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a cost-effective process for bonding polyethylene
glycol to fabric took years. But now it's show time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lister, president of Wisconsin Global Technologies, has
leased Vigo's patent on the material and confidently predicts the
polymer-coated fabric will be on store shelves within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lister breathlessly rattles off the virtues of clothing
containing the miracle molecule: ``Nontoxic, antimicrobial,
eliminates all odor-causing microbes, antistatic, antiwrinkle and
there's no shrinkage.''
</P>
<P>
   The elasticity of the molecules makes all fabrics tougher and
wrinkle resistant, while the molecules' tendency to soak up water
diffuses static charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Global Technologies' spin-off company, ThermoSense,
has begun manufacturing prototypes of phase-change slippers and
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Those springlike polyethylene glycol molecules will be a boon
for the medical industry as well. For reasons still not totally
understood, microorganisms cannot survive on fabrics treated with
the polymer. Perhaps the water-loving molecules make the clothing
so dry that bacteria cannot survive, or more likely the molecules
alter fabric fibers so that bacteria cannot attach themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Artley, president of Bayshore Holdings in New York City,
doesn't care; he's just happy to exploit the combination of
absorbency and antibacterial activity. Possibilities include
bandages that stop infection, and scrubs to protect doctors from
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on making bedding, blankets, footwear, wound-care
dressings and incontinence products,'' Artley says.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is reviewing the products. And there's more than one way
to engineer killer clothing. HaloSource in Seattle developed a
process to incorporate N-halamines, compounds used in swimming
pools to stabilize chlorine, into clothing fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching N-halamines to cotton gives chlorine atoms something
to hang on to and then, just as in a swimming pool, the chlorine
kills germs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, HaloSource's process will hit the market in
chlorine-engineered socks, diapers, bandages, medical uniforms and
air filters. When a garment begins to lose its potency, it can be
washed in chlorine bleach for a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acordis Acrylic Fibers in Bradford, England, has
engineered a fabric that targets other pests _ like those found in
a bed. Typically, a person shares an evening of rest with 2 million
dust mites, microscopic critters that feed off human skin cells and
cause health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Acordis' team of entomologists, chemists and materials
scientists came up with a surprising twist on acrylic fabrics. To
kill dust mites, the textile needed to take down the middleman, the
fungus Aspergillus repens, which breaks down flakes of human skin
into dust-mite meals. The company found a way to get acrylic fibers
to absorb a slow-release chemical that stops the fungus from
reproducing. Without the fungus, the mites eventually starve.
</P>
<P>
   Even more advanced engineered clothing will emerge from devices
that assemble textiles atom by atom. Such nano-technology mills
could completely transform how fabric is made.
</P>
<P>
   No longer would giant factories turn out hundreds of tons of
cloth a day. Instead, says materials engineer David Forrest,
president of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, nano-mills
will spit out custom fabrics from contraptions the size of
photocopy machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw materials such as nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen will be
put into a desk-size unit,'' Forrest explains, ``which will
rearrange the elements and control the trajectories of all the
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   What's he got in mind? Clothing that incorporates sensors to
detect rips and tears, alerting paramecium-size robotic crews to
execute repairs by means of the same atomic manipulation used to
make the garment in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What will they think of next?

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Every year, Hans-Joachim Pachur leaves his office in a pleasant
villa opposite the Berlin botanical garden and catches a plane for
Libya. In Tripoli he meets up with several colleagues and gets
ready for the desert.
</P>
<P>
   A geographer at the Free University of Berlin, Pachur has been
exploring the Sahara for the last quarter century. He and his team
are on a mission to find evidence that this barren land once
contained substantial amounts of water.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, in the Murzuq Sand Sea of southwestern Libya, Pachur
found animal bones as well as windblown ridges of lake-bed chalk _
evidence that the region had been dotted with bodies of freshwater.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago in the northern Sudan, Pachur found traces of a lake
that may have been as large as Erie. In that same region he traced
the course of a river that once flowed east into the upper Nile. He
has found other rivers that flowed from the Tibesti Mountains 600
miles north to the Mediterranean Sea, through the core of the
Sahara. That region now gets less than two-tenths of an inch of
rain each year.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lost rivers, between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago,
giraffes munched on acacia trees and hippos wallowed in mud. And
people lived there too. Pachur believes the Sahara then was an
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not experience this region the way we do, as a
hostile environment,'' he says. ``For them, it provided enormous
possibilities to blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the climate began to change, and the desert came. It
began sometime after 6,000 years ago. Within just a few centuries,
a gentle, fertile region the size of the United States was
transformed into one of the harshest places on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Saharans had to leave. Many must have migrated east into the
valley of the Nile, their closest source of water. That exodus,
some archaeologists think, may be the event that triggered the rise
of the pharaohs in Egypt a little more than 5,000 years ago. Eden
gave way to one of the planet's first great civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or catastrophe, the birth of the Sahara was not an act
of God. At the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, just
outside Berlin, a theoretical climatologist named Martin Claussen
and his graduate student Claudia Kubatzki have recently been able
to re-create the desert-building process on a computer. They say
that ultimately what keeps rain from falling on the Sahara is a
lack of plants _ which is not as paradoxical as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, who uses Pachur's data to anchor his model to reality,
has never been to the Sahara. But then he has never been to Jupiter
either, and in a way that's the starting point for any attempt to
explain the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's gravity and Venus' gravity pulls on Earth, causing our
planet to tilt on its axis to varying degrees. The tilt is what
gives Earth seasons: Summer happens in the northern hemisphere when
it is tilted toward the sun. The sun's zenith during this period
reaches as far north as the tropic of Cancer, which at present runs
through the Gilf Kebir and the southern edge of the Murzuq. That
latitude, 23.5 degrees, is the present tilt angle.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of a 41,000-year cycle, the tilt and the
tropic get as high as 24.5 and as low as 22.1 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   While Jupiter and Venus are tilting the Earth's axis, the sun
and moon are causing it to wobble like a top; that changes the time
of perihelion, the point on Earth's elliptical orbit at which the
planet comes closest to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Together these two cycles _ along with even slower perturbations
in the shape of the orbit _ determine how much sunlight falls on a
given latitude at a given season. They are called Milankovitch
cycles, after the Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who
proposed in the 1930s that such regularly occurring variations
could explain why Earth's climate goes in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory, the most recent ice sheets began
retreating from Canada and Eurasia around 17,000 years ago because
that's when the northern hemisphere started getting enough sun
during the summer to melt them.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 years ago, the northern sunlight curve was reaching
a peak; climatologists call this period the Holocene Optimum. The
axial tilt was higher than it is now, around 24 degrees, and
perihelion was in July. Both factors made for especially hot
northern summers and _ though it may seem surprising _ for a
greener Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ice age, the Sahara was a desert. But as the
summers got hotter, they also got wetter. During the summer, the
African landmass heats up more than the adjacent Atlantic, and that
temperature contrast drives the monsoon: as hot air rises up and
away over the land, moist winds flow northeast from the Gulf of
Guinea to replace it. Hotter summers mean a stronger monsoon that
brings more rainfall farther north, into the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that has been the whole explanation for why the
desert once bloomed _ but it just doesn't work, Claussen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to reproduce that process in a computer-model
atmosphere, the results are disappointing,'' he says. ``You end up
with a Sahara desert more or less where it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit more rain does fall on the desert, but not nearly enough
to support abundant vegetation or to create lakes. A few years ago,
Claussen had a hunch: Maybe the Sahara wasn't turning green in the
models simply because the models, unlike reality, weren't letting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Every gardener knows, he says, that climate zones dictate what
plants can grow where. But what about the reverse process _ might
vegetation have an influence on climate? In short, yes.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two ways in which vegetation itself might
procure the rainfall it needs. First, ground covered by plants is
darker than a desert; if you look at satellite images, the Sahara
is the brightest feature on Earth after the polar ice caps. It
reflects away as much as 40 percent of the sunlight it receives and
sends most of the rest right back into space, through cloudless
skies, as infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies get fried in the Sahara, but as far as the
atmosphere is concerned, the desert is a net cold source _ and so
most of the time air flows into the region at high altitude and
sinks, forming a dry region of high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If there were enough plants there, darkened ground would absorb
more sunlight, the atmosphere above the plants would be heated, and
the warm air would rise _ which is a prerequisite for clouds and
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The other prerequisite, of course, is water. Plant-covered soil
is invariably wetter than desert sand. When moist soil absorbs
sunlight, the water evaporates. In the atmosphere it condenses
again, releasing energy that fuels updrafts, and thereby forms
clouds. The clouds rain, returning water to the soil. The updrafts
strengthen the monsoon, pulling in more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop,'' Claussen
says.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues at Potsdam, Claussen developed a model that
incorporated this positive feedback. They turned its clock back to
9,000 years ago, and started it running with the sunlight
distribution prescribed for that date by Milankovitch, and lo! they
got a Sahara savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen let the model keep running. The positive feedback works
as well in reverse. By 6,000 years ago, Earth's axis was tilting
less than it had been, heading toward its current angle, and
perihelion was heading out of northern summer and toward winter.
Northern summers were getting cooler, the African monsoon a bit
weaker, and the vegetation in the savanna sparser.
</P>
<P>
   All this was happening very gradually; the orbital cycles are
subtle. But at some point _ in Claussen's model it was around 5,500
years ago _ the system crossed a threshold: the feedback kicked in.
Enough vegetation had been lost from the Sahara, enough bare ground
exposed, that precipitation declined sharply and barrenness began
to spread like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly things went downhill very rapidly,'' Claussen says.
Within a few centuries the cool moist soil had become sand.
</P>
<P>
   If we followed the Milankovitch clock, we would need to pass
through another ice age before the Sahara turned green again, but
we're not sticking to that timetable. Global warming caused by
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, a century or two
from now, provide the nudge to the monsoon that the tilt and wobble
of Earth's axis did in the middle Holocene.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen's model suggests it's possible, though he doesn't much
like to talk about it. The real message of his simulations, he
says, is that feedbacks in Earth's climate have in the past
produced abrupt climate changes that disrupted human societies
tremendously _ and we're not yet capable of predicting which
changes lie in our future. &QL;

<P>
   Every year, Hans-Joachim Pachur leaves his office in a pleasant
villa opposite the Berlin botanical garden and catches a plane for
Libya. In Tripoli he meets up with several colleagues and gets
ready for the desert.
</P>
<P>
   A geographer at the Free University of Berlin, Pachur has been
exploring the Sahara for the last quarter century. He and his team
are on a mission to find evidence that this barren land once
contained substantial amounts of water.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, in the Murzuq Sand Sea of southwestern Libya, Pachur
found animal bones as well as windblown ridges of lake-bed chalk _
evidence that the region had been dotted with bodies of freshwater.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago in the northern Sudan, Pachur found traces of a lake
that may have been as large as Erie. In that same region he traced
the course of a river that once flowed east into the upper Nile. He
has found other rivers that flowed from the Tibesti Mountains 600
miles north to the Mediterranean Sea, through the core of the
Sahara. That region now gets less than two-tenths of an inch of
rain each year.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lost rivers, between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago,
giraffes munched on acacia trees and hippos wallowed in mud. And
people lived there too. Pachur believes the Sahara then was an
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not experience this region the way we do, as a
hostile environment,'' he says. ``For them, it provided enormous
possibilities to blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the climate began to change, and the desert came. It
began sometime after 6,000 years ago. Within just a few centuries,
a gentle, fertile region the size of the United States was
transformed into one of the harshest places on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Saharans had to leave. Many must have migrated east into the
valley of the Nile, their closest source of water. That exodus,
some archaeologists think, may be the event that triggered the rise
of the pharaohs in Egypt a little more than 5,000 years ago. Eden
gave way to one of the planet's first great civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or catastrophe, the birth of the Sahara was not an act
of God. At the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, just
outside Berlin, a theoretical climatologist named Martin Claussen
and his graduatnt Claudia Kubatzki have recently been able
to re-create the desert-building process on a computer. They say
that ultimately what keeps rain from falling on the Sahara is a
lack of plants _ which is not as paradoxical as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, who uses Pachur's data to anchor his model to reality,
has never been to the Sahara. But then he has never been to Jupiter
either, and in a way that's the starting point for any attempt to
explain the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's gravity and Venus' gravity pulls on Earth, causing our
planet to tilt on its axis to varying degrees. The tilt is what
gives Earth seasons: Summer happens in the northern hemisphere when
it is tilted toward the sun. The sun's zenith during this period
reaches as far north as the tropic of Cancer, which at present runs
through the Gilf Kebir and the southern edge of the Murzuq. That
latitude, 23.5 degrees, is the present tilt angle.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of a 41,000-year cycle, the tilt and the
tropic get as high as 24.5 and as low as 22.1 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   While Jupiter and Venus are tilting the Earth's axis, the sun
and moon are causing it to wobble like a top; that changes the time
of perihelion, the point on Earth's elliptical orbit at which the
planet comes closest to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Together these two cycles _ along with even slower perturbations
in the shape of the orbit _ determine how much sunlight falls on a
given latitude at a given season. They are called Milankovitch
cycles, after the Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who
proposed in the 1930s that such regularly occurring variations
could explain why Earth's climate goes in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory, the most recent ice sheets began
retreating from Canada and Eurasia around 17,000 years ago because
that's when the northern hemisphere started getting enough sun
during the summer to melt them.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 years ago, the northern sunlight curve was reaching
a peak; climatologists call this period the Holocene Optimum. The
axial tilt was higher than it is now, around 24 degrees, and
perihelion was in July. Both factors made for especially hot
northern summers and _ though it may seem surprising _ for a
greener Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ice age, the Sahara was a desert. But as the
summers got hotter, they also got wetter. During the summer, the
African landmass heats up more than the adjacent Atlantic, and that
temperature contrast drives the monsoon: as hot air rises up and
away over the land, moist winds flow northeast from the Gulf of
Guinea to replace it. Hotter summers mean a stronger monsoon that
brings more rainfall farther north, into the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that has been the whole explanation for why the
desert once bloomed _ but it just doesn't work, Claussen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to reproduce that process in a computer-model
atmosphere, the results are disappointing,'' he says. ``You end up
with a Sahara desert more or less where it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit more rain does fall on the desert, but not nearly enough
to support abundant vegetation or to create lakes. A few years ago,
Claussen had a hunch: Maybe the Sahara wasn't turning green in the
models simply because the models, unlike reality, weren't letting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Every gardener knows, he says, that climate zones dictate what
plants can grow where. But what about the reverse process _ might
vegetation have an influence on climate? In short, yes.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two ways in which vegetation itself might
procure the rainfall it needs. First, ground covered by plants is
darker than a desert; if you look at satellite images, the Sahara
is the brightest feature on Earth after the polar ice caps. It
reflects away as much as 40 percent of the sunlight it receives and
sends most of the rest right back into space, through cloudless
skies, as infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies get fried in the Sahara, but as far as the
atmosphere is concerned, the desert is a net cold source _ and so
most of the time air flows into the region at high altitude and
sinks, forming a dry region of high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If there were enough plants there, darkened ground would absorb
more sunlight, the atmosphere above the plants would be heated, and
the warm air would rise _ which is a prerequisite for clouds and
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The other prerequisite, of course, is water. Plant-covered soil
is invariably wetter than desert sand. When moist soil absorbs
sunlight, the water evaporates. In the atmosphere it condenses
again, releasing energy that fuels updrafts, and thereby forms
clouds. The clouds rain, returning water to the soil. The updrafts
strengthen the monsoon, pulling in more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop,'' Claussen
says.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues at Potsdam, Claussen developed a model that
incorporated this positive feedback. They turned its clock back to
9,000 years ago, and started it running with the sunlight
distribution prescribed for that date by Milankovitch, and lo! they
got a Sahara savanna.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen let the model keep running. The positive feedback works
as well in reverse. By 6,000 years ago, Earth's axis was tilting
less than it had been, heading toward its current angle, and
perihelion was heading out of northern summer and toward winter.
Northern summers were getting cooler, the African monsoon a bit
weaker, and the vegetation in the savanna sparser.
</P>
<P>
   All this was happening very gradually; the orbital cycles are
subtle. But at some point _ in Claussen's model it was around 5,500
years ago _ the system crossed a threshold: the feedback kicked in.
Enough vegetation had been lost from the Sahara, enough bare ground
exposed, that precipitation declined sharply and barrenness began
to spread like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly things went downhill very rapidly,'' Claussen says.
Within a few centuries the cool moist soil had become sand.
</P>
<P>
   If we followed the Milankovitch clock, we would need to pass
through another ice age before the Sahara turned green again, but
we're not sticking to that timetable. Global warming caused by
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, a century or two
from now, provide the nudge to the monsoon that the tilt and wobble
of Earth's axis did in the middle Holocene.

&HT;     TIME FOR DEBATE ON PORT CHICAGO `MUTINY' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB RICHTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For nearly 50 years Freddie Meeks suppressed
discussing the most important event in his life. At Christmastime,
President Clinton pardoned him for it.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, now 80, was one of 50 black sailors court-martialed for
mutiny for refusing to load ammunition at the Port Chicago, Calif.,
naval weapons depot after an explosion there July 17, 1944, that
killed 320 men and wounded 390 others.
</P>
<P>
   Port Chicago has been a barnacle on the Navy's butt for 55
years. Last Father's Day, I wrote about Raye Adkins, whose father
died in the Port Chicago explosion 3 1/2 months before she was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, in 1944, loading ammo was vital to the war effort.
The rub at Port Chicago was that safety was secondary to speed, and
white officers wagered on whose black crew could load the most the
fastest.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, the officers got 30-day leaves; the
surviving ammo loaders picked up body parts.
</P>
<P>
   There was no psychological counseling. No time to grieve. The
men were ordered back to loading ammo under the threat of being
shot if they refused. When 50 said no, they were court-martialed
and sentenced to up to 15 years in the brig.
</P>
<P>
   Even the dead were abused. Rep. John Rankin, D-Miss., upon
learning that two-thirds of the victims were black, succeeded in
reducing death benefits for their survivors from a proposed $5,000
to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then Port Chicago went into the dirty laundry hamper of history.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins, the principal at Schulze Elementary School in San
Antonio and a doctoral candidate, says her family elders wouldn't
discuss her dad's death, that she grew up thinking he'd done
something bad. That she ``cried for days'' when, as an adult, she
learned of the injustices at what was clearly a Jim Crow base.
</P>
<P>
   About that time (the early 1990s), the truth about Port Chicago
began to ventilate. Robert L. Allen wrote ``The Port Chicago
Mutiny.'' Studs Terkel interviewed mutineer Joe Small in ``The Good
War.''
</P>
<P>
   There were movies and TV shows and, in 1994, the Navy admitted
the mutineers were victims of racial prejudice but refused to
overturn their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Now only two of them are still alive, Meeks of Los Angeles and
Jack Crittendon of Montgomery, Ala. While Meeks sought the pardon,
and praised Clinton for giving it to him, Crittendon remains
defiant.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the half-century after Port Chicago, Crittendon told
people he had been in the Army, to avoid talking about that part of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeks isn't thinking about the other sailors or the
congressman who cut the death benefits in half,'' Crittendon said
with conviction. ``Giving me a pardon now is like getting one after
you go to the electric chair. What is the benefit?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says, Congress should restore those Rankin-trimmed
death benefits, with interest, to the survivors of the Port Chicago
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins, who would benefit from such a stipend, agrees, but not
for reasons you might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the worth of these men still less because of the color of
their skin? she asks. ``We must remove the barriers of our past and
rectify injustices in ways that underscore the value and dignity of
all people for all times. Each time an injustice is removed, the
gap between racial equality and violent prejudices narrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it will be an uphill battle. Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., a hero in obtaining the Meeks pardon, seems to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 7 letter to Adkins, he writes: ``For the moment ...
let us note the victory we have achieved. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Some people contend the Port Chicago mutineers deserved to be
punished. If they got what they deserved, then so too should the
families of the patriotic black (and white) men who died on July
17, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the president called for a dialogue on race. How
about a congressional debate on Port Chicago, the catalyst for the
Navy to become the first service branch to desegregate? Reopening
the death benefit debate won't make the wrongs and the hurtfulness
of 55 years of quashed history go away. But it could be a signal
that this great and usually decent nation has a conscience.

&HT;     THE UNGRATIOUS HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There were three of them, these shivering little
kids, and they were standing outside the Armory Center in 28-degree
darkness watching grownups in fancy clothes cruise in to see
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who's running for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Melshilia White, a sixth-grader at Albany School 26, spotted me
as I came out into the evening chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mister,'' she said, ``Can we go inside to see Hillary?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'' turned out to be Melshilia and her brother Sylvester, 10,
and their little sister Shaniqua, 8. I asked them, ``What're you
guys doing out here at night? Why aren't you home watching TV like
sane kids?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary is my idol,'' Melshilia White explained. ``Can you
take us in to see her?''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. I'd just gotten thrown out. I'd heard about this
fund-raising soiree for Hillary Clinton. You paid $125 to see her
in a big group, downstairs in the Armory Center near Bumpers Cafe,
and you paid a cool grand to shake her hand upstairs in Yono's, one
of Albany's best restaurants. So, I dropped by Thursday night _
amateur night, it turned out to be _ to see just who was coming up
with all this cash.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reporter thing. We like to know who's giving money to
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   I went through the door, past the table where some of Clinton's
campaign staffers were collecting contributions. I said hello to a
few Albany Democrats I know. Then I climbed the stairs to Yono's to
see who was kicking in the really big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in the room, shaking hands, smiling. I was cruising
around, checking out faces and finally settling into a conversation
with Mike Breslin, the Albany County executive. Then this young guy
in a black suit came over. He said he was Ramon Martinez, the
Clinton campaign's political director, and this was a closed event.
No other reporters were there, after all.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out to Martinez that I often show up in places where
other reporters don't, but somehow that didn't impress him. I was
about to tell this guy that I've been thrown out of better places,
but I didn't because I haven't. Yono's is the best place I've ever
been bounced out of, actually.
</P>
<P>
   So, I went downstairs and started schmoozing with the players in
the $125 cheap seats _ until Martinez came down after me and threw
me out of there, too. Before I left, I insisted that somebody go
upstairs and get my coat. If this guy was going to toss me without
my coat, I was going to beg the cops to run him in.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself outside listening to Albany Democrats complain
that they'd gotten three separate invitations to this event and
wondering where these Clinton people got their mailing list. I was
hearing people moan that the Clinton campaign wouldn't take checks,
but that nobody had told them that until they got there and were
embarrassed for their trouble. And here were these three little
kids begging me to let them see Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that table inside the door?'' I said to Melshilia White.
``Go ask that man to get Mr. Martinez. Mr. Martinez is a very nice
man. I'm sure he'll let you see Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the kids came out, crestfallen. They'd been
bounced, too. The last I saw of them, they were on their way home
in the winter gloom _ a truly masterful move on the part of these
exceedingly brilliant Clinton campaign people.
</P>
<P>
   This is a 2-1 Democratic County. The Albany County Democratic
organization is one of the best political operations in the
country. If Clinton's campaign staff had let the local party people
run this affair, their candidate would have left this town with the
same money, at least.
</P>
<P>
   And, who knows? Maybe even with a few friends.

&HT;     CARING FOR LACQUERED CARVINGS MAY TAKE TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lacquer has been produced since prehistoric times in Asia to
protect and decorate furnishings and objects such as boxes, trays
and snuff bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabar is made from a toxic refined sap, which is highly
irritating or poisonous to humans before it has cured. The color
comes from bright red mercuric sulfide. A single piece can take
years to complete: From 50 to 100 or more layers of lacquer form a
single substructure. The finished pieces feature embedded materials
or deeply carved decorations such as landscapes, animals and
plants.
</P>
<P>
   As the layers of lacquer are applied, they are periodically
punctuated with a layer of black or another color to act as a depth
guide for carvers, according to Lark Mason, senior vice president
of Sotheby's and director of the auction house's on-line services.
</P>
<P>
   Incised and colored lacquer is also the same sort of cinnabar
color, according to Mason. He said other colors may be featured, as
well as gold leaf inlay, which disguises irregular cut edges of the
design.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabar lacquer is resistant to heat and is a great insulator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinnabar is impervious to most anything,'' Mason said. ``It
won't melt like plastic imitations or keep a fingernail print like
rubber simulations.'' However, damage from cracking or chipping can
expose the core, which is often wood, causing it to expand and
contract and further damage the surface.
</P>
<P>
   To restore cinnabar in the original technique can be costly,
Mason said. Restoration uses the same materials and 100 thin coats
of lacquer built up to the adjoining surface. Each coat of lacquer
takes three days to dry and the missing decoration must be
recarved.
</P>
<P>
   A less expensive repair would be to fill in with a composition
material in the approximate coloring before recarving the design. A
fine antiques house can recommend a person to do the restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabar lacquer pieces produced in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties
remain rare, highly priced and very collectible, Mason said. Pieces
made in Imperial workshops of the 18th and 19th century may be
found for under $5,000, and pieces not made in the workshops are
valued at between $500 and $3,000.

   The Japanese economy is following in the footsteps of the Grand

now appears to be marching swiftly down again. Below the surface,
however, there are reasons to believe that it is, in fact, slowly

   In the darkest hours of the past year, Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso seemed to cling to the hope that by
grimly sticking to an unpopular austerity program, not only would
his country's economy return to growth but his own popularity and
authority would eventually recover from the disorderly devaluation
of January 1999. &QL;

   When it eventually came, the end was quick and anti-climactic.
As dawn broke on Feb. 6, nearly 2,700 unarmed federal police walked
into the main campus of the National Autonomous University in
Mexico City, and led away 745 students and staff still holed up
inside its buildings. Thus ended a 292-day student strike and
occupation of the biggest university in the Americas. &QL;

   Here it comes again: the day for exchanging chocolates, roses,
champagne and promises, all wrapped up in pink hearts and ersatz
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Feb. 14, St. Valentine's Day _ already a great day for
gift-card shops, jewelers and department stores _ might this year
be a great day for the stock market too.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are the popular new way of expressing love, according to
a survey of 900 Internet users, one-third of them women. Carried
out by Money Talks, an online investment magazine, the survey
claims that 47 percent of women and 38 percent of men are intending
to buy shares as a gift this year.
</P>
<P>
   Exchanging gifts on St. Valentine's Day is as old as the feast
itself, which was celebrated in the market-square economies of the
Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   But the festivity has more to do with the time of year than with
Saint Valentine, of whom there were at least three, two of whom
were beheaded in the third century. All are venerated on Feb. 14,
but none seems to have had anything to do with love.
</P>
<P>
   St. Valentine's Day is more appropriately associated with the
coupling of birds and the return of spring, thanks mainly to
Chaucer's ``Parliament of Fowls'' (1382), one of the first
Valentine poems in English.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to humans to imitate the birds and choose
themselves a mate on that day was a popular motif in France too.
Rather like Carnival, St. Valentine's Day provided a lusty break
near the abstemious austerity of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   In Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,'' Ophelia describes the occasion as
one on which a young man was liable to: ``Let in the maid that out
a maid Never departed more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, the overtly sexual connotations were
bowdlerized and the poet Coventry Patmore was able to reduce St.
Valentine's Day to a day of chaste wooing in ``vestal February,''
set against a background of virginal snowdrops.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists link the feast to more lusty end-of-winter
fertility rituals such as the Roman Lupercalia, when men clad in
goatskins went around flagellating all the women in sight in order
to make them fertile.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, the women flagellating back. In ``Valentine's
Day: Women Against Men,'' a collection of short stories edited by
Alice Thomas Ellis and due to be published in Britain on
Valentine's Day, the male ego takes an awesome beating.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Eating Vic,'' a short story by the South African writer
Shelley Weiner, a wife sees the gifts of jewelry and clothes that
are showered on her as meager compensation for the ``pound of
flesh'' exacted by a libidinous husband.
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming of the day when she will be a rich widow, she tries,
but fails, to hasten his demise.
</P>
<P>
   In Sylvia Petter's ``Widow's Peak,'' a wife wreaks a bizarre
revenge after she discovers that she shares her Valentine's heart
with another: ``At the end of February, the florist's bill arrived.
The flowers for Valentine's had been delightful, but two bunches?''
</P>
<P>
   Women who prefer wooing to being wooed _ and a browse through
this year's Internet Valentine's messages suggests that quite a few
of them do _ can take advantage of the fact that this year is a
leap year and wait for St. Oswald's Day, another medieval feast.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Feb. 29, once every four years women are enjoined
to make the first move. In non-leap years to come, impatient women
might want to join the Roman Catholic Church and celebrate St.
Oswald's Day on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking ahead for a day suitable for celebrating
post-feminist reconciliation between the sexes should look to St.
George's Day, April 23, which also happens to be the birthday of
Shakespeare and the day on which Cervantes died.
</P>
<P>
   St. George is England's patron saint and also Catalonia's, and
Catalans already celebrate the day as one of harmony between the
sexes by exchanging roses and books. Booksellers and florists
outside Catalonia are looking closely at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Stockbrokers might be well advised to do so too. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget geography, forget culture. The thing called ``Europe''
that a dozen or more ex-communist and other countries want to join
_ and with which they engage in formal talks next week _ is about
politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe's political and economic order is by no means
settled. It is shifting, and more rapidly than would have seemed
likely even five years ago. So pronounced is the recent change in
fact that one may even question how distinctively European this
Europe will seem in, say, another five years.
</P>
<P>
   To a surprising extent, especially when measured against what
politicians say, Western Europe's parties of the left, many of them
now in power, are moving away from their traditional statist
dogmatism towards a pragmatic, if reluctant, recognition of
unavoidable economic facts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the global market for capital is encroaching
on European boardrooms, which have traditionally run their
companies as though shareholders were of little account, valuing
order and stability (of managers' careers, especially) over return
on equity.
</P>
<P>
   If you were alarmed by these developments, you would say that
the tyranny of market forces is driving both changes, and that
Europe's social model _ esteemed by Europe's citizens, if not by
global financiers _ is in rapid retreat and must in the end be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, democracy loses and borderless capitalism wins.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect poses an enormous challenge to Europe's
governments, not least in thinking about what the new European
Idea, if any, should be.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit that for years has animated the European project _
the striving for ``ever-closer union'' _ draws in some quarters on
distaste for and distrust of American might in business, diplomacy
and arms.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot have escaped notice that, in economics and economic
policy, the European model which seems in retreat is giving way to
none other than the American kind, with leftist parties narrowing
the gap between themselves and America's New Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And hitherto national markets for corporate control in Europe
are merging not merely into one EU pool but into a truly global
(that is, American-dominated) common market, forgive the
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: what is the point of ``Europe,'' if Europe is
turning out to be just another United States?
</P>
<P>
   In certain obvious ways, of course, that is a fate devoutly to
be wished. A stiff dose of American competition, innovation and
enterprise is not something that only global financiers should want
to see in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's citizens will also see the benefit, in lower
unemployment and a higher standard of living. It is precisely
because Europe's governments, and their voters, are at last coming
to see this connection that moves are afoot to liberalize their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   If the will of the people called for high double-digit
unemployment and economic backwardness, Europe's democratic
governments could carry on supplying both quite happily, global
market or no.
</P>
<P>
   So it is wrong to say that democracy is losing. People are
voting for lower taxes, less public spending, a lighter hand of
regulation: that is why hitherto leftist governments have made a
start on delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, of course, there are difficult choices to be made.
Labor and capital markets as ruthlessly efficient as America's
offer more wealth but, for many at least, less economic security.
</P>
<P>
   If Europe's leftist parties are correct, voters want to see the
trade-off shifted towards wealth, but maybe not by much. And there
is no reason why the degree of shifting should not vary from
country to country within Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The ``European model'' may be bad as description (since the EU's
economies do vary a lot), but as prescription it is positively
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly competition among policy regimes _ in the context of
free movement of labor, goods, services and capital _ could prove
to be Europe's greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   Competition makes for better government, just as it makes for
better business. That kind of rivalry, within a union of national
systems sharing a common currency, would indeed stand as something
both promising and distinctively European.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it might require an even bigger adjustment than
the one that is already under way. In Europe's governments,
consensus still tends to be valued above challenge, let alone
competition _ and among its politicians there is no consensus like
Euro-consensus. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The desire to speak for Europe, even when there is no merit in
speaking for Europe, is illustrated by the remarkable response to
Joerg Haider's Freedom Party entering the Austrian government, a
row that shows no sign of subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, the EU's 14 angry governments are having to ostracize
Austria bilaterally, not through their club, of which Austria is a
member in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Portugal's prime minister, speaking as club president, still
says Haider's party is ``not suitable'' to be in the EU. Belgium's
foreign minister says ``Europe can very well do without Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   His French counterpart says ``we can't have trustful relations
with a government which doesn't completely share the same
objectives of the European Union.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that such statements are likely to gain Haider
further support.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Austria has broken no EU rules: there is
nothing here about which ``Europe'' should have a view, one way or
the other. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what is Europe? It is a union of democratic states, whose
members must meet agreed-upon standards of political decency as
well as economic competence.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cooperative venture, in which states accept a measure of
mutual interference in specific areas. And it is a work in
progress, which must constantly debate its direction, its speed and
its geometry, and which must soon change its rules to accommodate
the applicants at its door.
</P>
<P>
   Its goals are, or should be, peace and prosperity in the region.
They are plenty to be getting on with. For the foreseeable future,
Europe will need no bigger Idea than these. &QL;

both promising and distinctively European.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it might require an even bigger adjustment than
the one that is already under way. In Europe's governments,
consensus still tends to be valued above challenge, let alone
competition _ and among its politicians there is no consensus like
Euro-consensus. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The desire to speak for Europe, even when there is no merit in
speaking for Europe, is illustrated by the remarkable response to
Joerg Haider's Freedom Party entering the Austrian government, a
row that shows no sign of subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, the EU's 14 angry governments are having to ostracize
Austria bilaterally, not through their club, of which Austria is a
member in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Portugal's prime minister, speaking as club president, still
says Haider's party is ``not suitable'' to be in the EU. Belgium's
foreign minister says ``Europe can very well do without Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   His French counterpart says ``we can't have trustful relations
with a government which doesn't completely share the same
objectives of the European Union.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that such statements are likely to gain Haider
further support.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Austria has broken no EU rules: there is
nothing here about which ``Europe'' should have a view, one way or
the other. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   So what is Europe? It is a union of democratic states, whose
members must meet agreed-upon standards of political decency as
well as economic competence.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cooperative venture, in which states accept a measure of
mutual interference in specific areas. And it is a work in
progress, which must constantly debate its direction, its speed and
its geometry, and which must soon change its rules to accommodate
the applicants at its door.
</P>
<P>
   Its goals are, or should be, peace and prosperity in the region.
They are plenty to be getting on with. For the foreseeable future,
Europe will need no bigger Idea than these. &QL;

<P>
   Remember the architect of compassionate conservatism? The great
unifier of his party's warring tribes? The political superstar who
was going to drive Al Gore back to the family farm?
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago George W. Bush could do no wrong. Now he can
hardly do anything right.
</P>
<P>
   His 26-point victory in tiny Delaware on Feb. 8 has done little
to obliterate the memory of New Hampshire, or to dispel the growing
smell of disaster that surrounds his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the dying days of the New Hampshire primary, he appeared on
stage with his two best assets, his father and mother, only to hear
the old man coo over ``this boy, this son of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   He burnished his conservative credentials in South Carolina with
a speech at Bob Jones University, only to face questions about why
a man with a Latina sister-in-law could have any dealings with an
institution that bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when it looked as if things could not get any worse,
Dan Quayle came along with his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 19-point defeat in New Hampshire was clearly a problem
for a candidate whose appeal was largely based on a sense of
inevitability. But an even greater problem has been his campaign's
reaction to the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   When he lost the New Hampshire primary in 1984, Walter Mondale
immediately and judiciously acknowledged his weaknesses, vowing to
fight the election state by state, and mocking Gary Hart with the
question ``Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Bush campaign's response to New Hampshire has been a
mixture of arrogance and panic.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis meeting in Austin on Feb. 5-6 blamed Bush's failure on
New Hampshire's enthusiasm for giving the front-runner the finger,
and on McCain's success in putting character, rather than issues,
at the heart of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now hellbent on changing the subject back to the issues.
He will emphasize his manifold achievements as a governor, which
include reforming education, welfare, taxation, tort law and
practically everything else in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And he will point out that McCain's pet pieces of legislation,
against tobacco and in favor of campaign-finance reform, have come
to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reformer with results'' is his campaign's new slogan.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that a rich kid who spent the Vietnam
War flying around Texas should not want to go toe-to-toe on the
character question with a man who got rather closer to the action.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little sign that people are crying out for more
discussion of earned-income tax credits (or whatever). Prosperity
has dulled the appetite for policy briefings; and Bill Clinton's
personal failings have put character at the center of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much sign that Bush has even chosen the right
issues. So far the electorate seems more impressed with McCain's
fiscal prudence and debt-reduction than with the governor's
trillion-dollar tax cuts. Besides, Bush is not a natural issues
man, in the way Bill Clinton and Al Gore so obviously are. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of his great strengths as a candidate is his
hail-fellow-well-met personality, and his only chance of beating
the vice president in November lies in giving the issues the widest
possible berth.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to rebrand the governor as a ``reformer with
results'' at least displays a willingness to change, as does the
decision to launch a series of negative ads about McCain's supposed
hypocrisy and flakiness.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush needs to go much further. His failure in New Hampshire
was not just the result of tactical errors that could have been put
right by visiting more Dunkin' Donuts and spending fewer weekends
in Austin (though that would have helped). It is the result of the
fact that McCain's insurgency has rendered his entire strategy
obsolete. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers can almost be forgiven for running his campaign
as a coronation, scripted to the very last detail.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy had served their man well in the governor's race in
1998 (when he was surrounded by the same advisers); and it seemed
to be merited by the cascade of money and endorsements that kept
landing on the dauphin's head.
</P>
<P>
   But there was always a downside to this approach. Keeping a
candidate away from the press only reinforces the suspicion that he
is an airhead. Telling a front-runner that all he has to do is to
stay ``on message'' tempts him to sit on his lead.
</P>
<P>
   And encouraging a challenger to act like an incumbent robs him
of his most powerful weapon, the shock of the new, particularly
when the real incumbent is Bill Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   Now the McCain insurgency is making even the merits of this way
of doing things look like defects.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to have the money to be running in all 50 states.
But when your opponent is putting his campaign together on the
hoof, it makes you look like a multinational corporation.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to have the support of the elders in your party. But
when your opponent is a charming maverick it makes you look like a
boring conformist.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to be able to call on Poppy and Ba for help. But
when your opponent is a 63-year-old war hero, in the genuine sense
of that phrase, it makes you look like a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp is constantly trying to have the best of both
worlds _ claiming that their man is an outsider with one breath and
boasting that he has been endorsed by 38 senators with the other _
and then ending up with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So what can they do? The first thing is to thank God for John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican crown had fallen to Bush without a contest, as
once looked likely, Al Gore would have torn his lungs out in the
autumn; now he can survive only if he learns how to fight. Being
bloodied will be good for him.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing is to start campaigning like a challenger, as
he did in the 1994 governor's race, when he fought a popular
incumbent for every vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the most urgent change goes even deeper. He needs to tear up
the script and throw away the cue cards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is much brighter than his frat-boy act leads one to
suppose. He should mingle with the press. Bush is also a likeable
fellow. He should cut down on the pre-programmed dirges from the
platform and reach out to his audience.
</P>
<P>
   An old badge from the glory days of the 1980s reads ``Let Reagan
be Reagan.'' The Bush campaign's best chance of surviving lies in
letting W. be W. &QL;

character question with a man who got rather closer to the action.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little sign that people are crying out for more
discussion of earned-income tax credits (or whatever). Prosperity
has dulled the appetite for policy briefings; and Bill Clinton's
personal failings have put character at the center of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much sign that Bush has even chosen the right
issues. So far the electorate seems more impressed with McCain's
fiscal prudence and debt-reduction than with the governor's
trillion-dollar tax cuts. Besides, Bush is not a natural issues
man, in the way Bill Clinton and Al Gore so obviously are. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of his great strengths as a candidate is his
hail-fellow-well-met personality, and his only chance of beating
the vice president in November lies in giving the issues the widest
possible berth.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to rebrand the governor as a ``reformer with
results'' at least displays a willingness to change, as does the
decision to launch a series of negative ads about McCain's supposed
hypocrisy and flakiness.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush needs to go much further. His failure in New Hampshire
was not just the result of tactical errors that could have been put
right by visiting more Dunkin' Donuts and spending fewer weekends
in Austin (though that would have helped). It is the result of the
fact that McCain's insurgency has rendered his entire strategy
obsolete. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers can almost be forgiven for running his campaign
as a coronation, scripted to the very last detail.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy had served their man well in the governor's race in
1998 (when he was surrounded by the same advisers); and it seemed
to be merited by the cascade of money and endorsements that kept
landing on the dauphin's head.
</P>
<P>
   But there was always a downside to this approach. Keeping a
candidate away from the press only reinforces the suspicion that he
is an airhead. Telling a front-runner that all he has to do is to
stay ``on message'' tempts him to sit on his lead.
</P>
<P>
   And encouraging a challenger to act like an incumbent robs him
of his most powerful weapon, the shock of the new, particularly
when the real incumbent is Bill Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   Now the McCain insurgency is making even the merits of this way
of doing things look like defects.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to have the money to be running in all 50 states.
But when your opponent is putting his campaign together on the
hoof, it makes you look like a multinational corporation.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to have the support of the elders in your party. But
when your opponent is a charming maverick it makes you look like a
boring conformist.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to be able to call on Poppy and Ba for help. But
when your opponent is a 63-year-old war hero, in the genuine sense
of that phrase, it makes you look like a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp is constantly trying to have the best of both
worlds _ claiming that their man is an outsider with one breath and
boasting that he has been endorsed by 38 senators with the other _
and then ending up with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So what can they do? The first thing is to thank God for John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican crown had fallen to Bush without a contest, as
once looked likely, Al Gore would have torn his lungs out in the
autumn; now he can survive only if he learns how to fight. Being
bloodied will be good for him.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing is to start campaigning like a challenger, as
he did in the 1994 governor's race, when he fought a popular
incumbent for every vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the most urgent change goes even deeper. He needs to tear up
the script and throw away the cue cards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is much brighter than his frat-boy act leads one to
suppose. He should mingle with the press. Bush is also a likeable
fellow. He should cut down on the pre-programmed dirges from the
platform and reach out to his audience.
</P>
<P>
   An old badge from the glory days of the 1980s reads ``Let Reagan
be Reagan.'' The Bush campaign's best chance of surviving lies in
letting W. be W. &QL;

<P>
   Something remarkable is stirring in American politics. In
California and Massachusetts, state offices are overwhelmed with
Democrats and Independents wanting to change their registration so
that they can vote for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, a Catholic priest, Joseph Gembala, interrupts a
meeting of McCain's supporters, saying, ``I have mass in 20
minutes,'' and asks the Arizona senator to sign a copy of his
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   As he hurries out, Father Gembala says that McCain is the first
Republican he has ever decided to vote for. ``I know a lot of
Democrats who are going to vote for this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign headquarters is getting 1,000 e-mails a
day saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   American politics is littered with the remains of outsiders who
surprisingly won the New Hampshire primary in the winter but were
forgotten by the spring. In 1984, Gary Hart, a Democrat from
Colorado, won New Hampshire in February but then discovered that he
could not deny Walter Mondale the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a rank outsider, Pat Buchanan, won the Republican
primary, boasting that the peasants were storming the party with
pitchforks. The pitchforks punctured his own bubble in South
Carolina a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most powerful insurgent of them all, Ronald Reagan,
failed to topple the establishment candidate (Gerald Ford) in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   That is the measure of John McCain's task as he sets out on his
famous bus, the Straight Talk Express, to wrest the Republican
nomination from the Republicans' favored son, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first week after New Hampshire is a vital test of whether a
campaign can turn from electoral upset to wide appeal. Hart and
Buchanan failed. McCain has not.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign manager, Rick Davis, says, ``Campaigns are won
one day at a time, and we have won the past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was the predictable victor in the Delaware primary
this week, McCain won what you might call the expectations contest,
attracting 25 percent of the vote without even setting foot in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who won Delaware in 1996, came third and dropped
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the opinion polls revealed a remarkable surge in
McCain's support. Two days after his New Hampshire victory, he drew
level with Bush in South Carolina, the next state to vote, having
been 20 points behind a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in Michigan, which votes three days after South Carolina,
showed the two in a dead heat. In January, Bush had been 34 points
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the two biggest states which go to the polls on March 7,
McCain narrowed yawning gaps: in California, he halved Bush's lead
to 19 points and, in New York, cut it to a mild nine points.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers suggest one advantage that McCain has over
previous insurgents. Buchanan's support had been concentrated among
angry blue-collar workers worried about their jobs. McCain's
reaches out into a variety of different groups. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, turning an initial display of interest into real votes
requires organization. Here, McCain has an advantage over Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Having won New Hampshire in 1984, the Colorado senator was
flooded with offers of money and help. But, having been a virtual
unknown before the vote, he had no organization.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes with the checks in them piled up unopened at Hart
headquarters. He failed to capitalize on his early win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain too is being inundated with cash. He has raised over $2
million in a week. But this has come over the Internet. The money
can be banked electronically and used immediately. And he knows
what to do with the volunteers. An amazing 26,000 have signed up in
the past week alone. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hart, McCain was a national figure when the campaign
opened. He had raised $15 million by January, and already had the
rudiments of an organization to put those volunteers vigorously to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he will never be Bush's equal in sheer volume of
money and organization. So the essence of his strategy is to bring
new voters _ not necessarily all registered Republicans _ to swing
the primaries his way.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth and Coleridge said that they had to create the taste
by which their poetry was enjoyed. McCain is trying to create the
electorate by which his candidacy will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire showed how powerful this approach can be. Some 40
percent of those who voted were either independents or former
Democrats. McCain won their votes by three-to-one, or 40 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, dismissed these people as
``quirky, maverick, liberal independents.'' His problem is that the
past week has shown how many of them there are, all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By good luck, several of the next primaries, including South
Carolina's and Michigan's, are ``open'': anyone may vote in the
Republican poll. In other big states, including California and
Massachusetts, former Democrats may vote if they switch their
registration.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts secretary of state, William Galvin, says he is
swamped by calls from Democrats asking to drop their party
affiliation so that they can vote for McCain in the Republican
primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Independents and those who cross party lines have a lot of
clout. Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster, explains how.
</P>
<P>
   If independents cast a third of the votes and McCain wins them
by 40 percentage points, as he did in New Hampshire, that gives him
a 12-point margin overall. To overcome that, Bush has to win the
two-thirds who are registered Republicans by more than 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   This is a formidable task if voters start thinking of the race
as a contest of equals _ as they are now doing.
</P>
<P>
   So the main questions about the primary season are becoming: How
many independent voters are there? And can McCain prevent Bush from
winning big among registered Republicans? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000, OR CONTINUE TO 1,450) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the country as a whole, only about 15 percent of voters are
independents (many states do not keep party registrations, so there
is no sure figure). Their numbers are rising but this would not be
enough to sustain a McCain insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   If you look state by state, though, McCain's chances look
better. In California, says Bernd Schwieren, 21 percent of voters
are independents, up from 12 percent in 1992. Among those
registering for the first time, independents outstrip Republicans
three-to-one.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush retains his lead in the state, McCain won himself
many friends when he addressed the annual gathering of the
Republican Party just after the New Hampshire vote.
</P>
<P>
   One party stalwart described the response as the most
enthusiastic since Ronald Reagan addressed the party 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the potential McCain constituency is bigger: almost
a third of those planning to vote in the Republican primary are
independents. This state is home to the so-called ``Reagan
Democrats,'' industrial workers who usually lean towards the
Democratic Party but voted for Reagan because he appealed to their
social and economic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has set about renewing that appeal. At a meeting in
Macomb County in the Detroit suburbs, he talked for the first time
of ``McCain Democrats,'' and claimed that ``the whole essence of
the Republican Party should be to reach out across party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable statement from someone contesting a primary
election. This suggests that McCain might _ just might _ be able to
win Michigan and even California. But both races are likely to be
close, and strongly influenced by South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the opinion polls suggest that no fewer than 37 percent of
voters are independents _ a motley bunch including ex-servicemen
(the state has proportionately more of these than any other state)
and retired Yankees (who outnumber native Southerners on the coast,
says Mark Sanford, the congressman who represents most of that
region).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, a third of voters describe themselves as
religious conservatives, twice as many as in Michigan or
California. This was the only group of Republican voters that
McCain lost in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So South Carolina will be vital in two ways: it will test the
relative strength of independents and religious conservatives, and
it will set the scene for two big states, Michigan and California,
that McCain needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he stood no chance in either place. Now, the fact
that he has even an outside chance is testimony to his
extraordinary powers of attracting support from way beyond the
party's traditional ranks. &QL;

<P>
   McCain has set about renewing that appeal. At a meeting in
Macomb County in the Detroit suburbs, he talked for the first time
of ``McCain Democrats,'' and claimed that ``the whole essence of
the Republican Party should be to reach out across party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable statement from someone contesting a primary
election. This suggests that McCain might _ just might _ be able to
win Michigan and even California. But both races are likely to be
close, and strongly influenced by South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the opinion polls suggest that no fewer than 37 percent of
voters are independents _ a motley bunch including ex-servicemen
(the state has proportionately more of these than any other state)
and retired Yankees (who outnumber native Southerners on the coast,
says Mark Sanford, the congressman who represents most of that
region).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, a third of voters describe themselves as
religious conservatives, twice as many as in Michigan or
California. This was the only group of Republican voters that
McCain lost in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So South Carolina will be vital in two ways: it will test the
relative strength of independents and religious conservatives, and
it will set the scene for two big states, Michigan and California,
that McCain needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he stood no chance in either place. Now, the fact
that he has even an outside chance is testimony to his
extraordinary powers of attracting support from way beyond the
party's traditional ranks. &QL;

<P>
   Something remarkable is stirring in American politics. In
California and Massachusetts, state offices are overwhelmed with
Democrats and Independents wanting to change their registration so
that they can vote for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, a Catholic priest, Joseph Gembala, interrupts a
meeting of McCain's supporters, saying, ``I have mass in 20
minutes,'' and asks the Arizona senator to sign a copy of his
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   As he hurries out, Father Gembala says that McCain is the first
Republican he has ever decided to vote for. ``I know a lot of
Democrats who are going to vote for this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign headquarters is getting 1,000 e-mails a
day saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   American politics is littered with the remains of outsiders who
surprisingly won the New Hampshire primary in the winter but were
forgotten by the spring. In 1984, Gary Hart, a Democrat from
Colorado, won New Hampshire in February but then discovered that he
could not deny Walter Mondale the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a rank outsider, Pat Buchanan, won the Republican
primary, boasting that the peasants were storming the party with
pitchforks. The pitchforks punctured his own bubble in South
Carolina a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most powerful insurgent of them all, Ronald Reagan,
failed to topple the establishment candidate (Gerald Ford) in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   That is the measure of John McCain's task as he sets out on his
famous bus, the Straight Talk Express, to wrest the Republican
nomination from the Republicans' favored son, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first week after New Hampshire is a vital test of whether a
campaign can turn from electoral upset to wide appeal. Hart and
Buchanan failed. McCain has not.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign manager, Rick Davis, says, ``Campaigns are won
one day at a time, and we have won the past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was the predictable victor in the Delaware primary
this week, McCain won what you might call the expectations contest,
attracting 25 percent of the vote without even setting foot in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who won Delaware in 1996, came third and dropped
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the opinion polls revealed a remarkable surge in
McCain's support. Two days after his New Hampshire victory, he drew
level with Bush in South Carolina, the next state to vote, having
been 20 points behind a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in Michigan, which votes three days after South Carolina,
showed the two in a dead heat. In January, Bush had been 34 points
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the two biggest states which go to the polls on March 7,
McCain narrowed yawning gaps: in California, he halved Bush's lead
to 19 points and, in New York, cut it to a mild nine points.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers suggest one advantage that McCain has over
previous insurgents. Buchanan's support had been concentrated among
angry blue-collar workers worried about their jobs. McCain's
reaches out into a variety of different groups. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, turning an initial display of interest into real votes
requires organization. Here, McCain has an advantage over Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Having won New Hampshire in 1984, the Colorado senator was
flooded with offers of money and help. But, having been a virtual
unknown before the vote, he had no organization.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes with the checks in them piled up unopened at Hart
headquarters. He failed to capitalize on his early win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain too is being inundated with cash. He has raised over $2
million in a week. But this has come over the Internet. The money
can be banked electronically and used immediately. And he knows
what to do with the volunteers. An amazing 26,000 have signed up in
the past week alone. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hart, McCain was a national figure when the campaign
opened. He had raised $15 million by January, and already had the
rudiments of an organization to put those volunteers vigorously to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he will never be Bush's equal in sheer volume of
money and organization. So the essence of his strategy is to bring
new voters _ not necessarily all registered Republicans _ to swing
the primaries his way.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth and Coleridge said that they had to create the taste
by which their poetry was enjoyed. McCain is trying to create the
electorate by which his candidacy will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire showed how powerful this approach can be. Some 40
percent of those who voted were either independents or former
Democrats. McCain won their votes by three-to-one, or 40 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, dismissed these people as
``quirky, maverick, liberal independents.'' His problem is that the
past week has shown how many of them there are, all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By good luck, several of the next primaries, including South
Carolina's and Michigan's, are ``open'': anyone may vote in the
Republican poll. In other big states, including California and
Massachusetts, former Democrats may vote if they switch their
registration.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts secretary of state, William Galvin, says he is
swamped by calls from Democrats asking to drop their party
affiliation so that they can vote for McCain in the Republican
primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Independents and those who cross party lines have a lot of
clout. Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster, explains how.
</P>
<P>
   If independents cast a third of the votes and McCain wins them
by 40 percentage points, as he did in New Hampshire, that gives him
a 12-point margin overall. To overcome that, Bush has to win the
two-thirds who are registered Republicans by more than 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   This is a formidable task if voters start thinking of the race
as a contest of equals _ as they are now doing.
</P>
<P>
   So the main questions about the primary season are becoming: How
many independent voters are there? And can McCain prevent Bush from
winning big among registered Republicans? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000, OR CONTINUE TO 1,450) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the country as a whole, only about 15 percent of voters are
independents (many states do not keep party registrations, so there
is no sure figure). Their numbers are rising but this would not be
enough to sustain a McCain insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   If you look state by state, though, McCain's chances look
better. In California, says Bernd Schwieren, 21 percent of voters
are independents, up from 12 percent in 1992. Among those
registering for the first time, independents outstrip Republicans
three-to-one.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush retains his lead in the state, McCain won himself
many friends when he addressed the annual gathering of the
Republican Party just after the New Hampshire vote.
</P>
<P>
   One party stalwart described the response as the most
enthusiastic since Ronald Reagan addressed the party 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the potential McCain constituency is bigger: almost
a third of those planning to vote in the Republican primary are
independents. This state is home to the so-called ``Reagan
Democrats,'' industrial workers who usually lean towards the
Democratic Party but voted for Reagan because he appealed to their
social and economic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has set about renewing that appeal. At a meeting in
Macomb County in the Detroit suburbs, he talked for the first time
of ``McCain Democrats,'' and claimed that ``the whole essence of
the Republican Party should be to reach out across party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable statement from someone contesting a primary
election. This suggests that McCain might _ just might _ be able to
win Michigan and even California. But both races are likely to be
close, and strongly influenced by South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the opinion polls suggest that no fewer than 37 percent of

(the state has proportionately more of these than any other state)
and retired Yankees (who outnumber native Southerners on the coast,
says Mark Sanford, the congressman who represents most of that
region).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, a third of voters describe themselves as
religious conservatives, twice as many as in Michigan or
California. This was the only group of Republican voters that
McCain lost in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So South Carolina will be vital in two ways: it will test the
relative strength of independents and religious conservatives, and
it will set the scene for two big states, Michigan and California,
that McCain needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he stood no chance in either place. Now, the fact
that he has even an outside chance is testimony to his
extraordinary powers of attracting support from way beyond the
party's traditional ranks. &QL;

<P>
   ``One almost believes the Internet was created for Reuters,''
said Peter Job, the company's chief executive, at a briefing for
analysts on Feb. 8 when he announced the company's new
Internet-centered strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet and Reuters have much in common. Both are
electronic networks, operating in real time, whose job is to
transmit information.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they have so much in common that it is easy to imagine
how the Internet could replace Reuters. And that is the danger
Reuters is now moving very quickly to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters spent much of its 149 years as a news agency owned by
newspapers to service newspapers. Twenty years ago, it spotted the
financial markets' growing need for information, and set itself up
as an information exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It now has over half a million users in 60,000 companies who pay
an average of $1,500 a month to get their information from its
proprietary network.
</P>
<P>
   It now owns about half the $6 billion business for financial
information, with growing shares taken by Bloomberg and Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its core business, Reuters still has its news
service, which it sells to newspapers, broadcasters and,
increasingly, to Internet portals.
</P>
<P>
   It owns Instinet, one of the small pack of
electronic-communications networks that are challenging the old
trading exchanges; and it has a startlingly successful
``greenhouse'' fund whose main claim to fame is that it invested $1
million in Yahoo! in 1994, when its founders were still at college.
</P>
<P>
   It is the core business, which (including transactional
products) brings in 93 percent of the company's revenues, that is
under threat. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Reuters' most important clients,
such as the big broking houses, are themselves under pressure.
Their margins are falling because of competition from online
brokers, which offer trades at $15 (instead of several hundred
dollars) a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Their business is going the same way through the growth of day
trading. And the merger of banks and brokers is cutting the number
of dealers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Internet is opening new channels for
information. In the past, sellers of real-time financial
information (such as the New York Stock Exchange) had to go through
an intermediary (such as Reuters) to get to the buyers of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Now companies such as CityNet, which has developed a protocol
for sending financial information instantaneously over the
Internet, allow exchanges and others producing financial
information to bypass the intermediary and sell their information
direct to the end-user _ at much lower cost. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reuters has had no coherent answer to this, until now, and
investors have not been happy.
</P>
<P>
   After a particularly unfortunate briefing last September, when
analysts wanted to hear a strategy articulated and Job made it
clear that he didn't have one, the share price plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reuters has come up with its answer: to go with the flow. If
the Internet disintermediates wholesalers, then Reuters will move
from being a wholesaler to being a retailer, and use the Internet
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it used to sell its information to hundreds of
thousands, down its dedicated lines. The Internet allows it to sell
to millions. ``There are upwards of 60 million people who can be
considered as targets,'' said Job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reuters will go after these people in three main ways. As well
as its high-end product, it will offer several tiers of service,
with the cheapest product $100 a month or less.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet is launching an online retail service in April. And
Reuters.com will become a financial portal to offer all sorts of
products to retail investors.
</P>
<P>
   The core business, meanwhile, will be reorganized at a cost of
Pounds300 million ($480 million) to deliver its products according
to the protocols used by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A joint venture announced on Feb. 3 with Equant, a telecoms
company, will establish a secure IP-based network. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The markets liked the strategy. Nevertheless, it creates
problems for Reuters, as well as solving them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reuters wants to get into the retail business, it will
go on being a wholesaler, because that is where its revenues come
from. But if Reuters succeeds as a retailer, it is bound to
cannibalize its own revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, as Job said in his presentation, is ``to be the
provider of the information and the capabilities that allow people
to ramp up their activities on the Internet.'' But the more
individuals ``ramp up,'' the worse it is for the brokers and banks
who buy Reuters' high-end products.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, similarly, Reuters has made a good business out
of selling its news services to Web sites _ 900 of them. Its
revenues from this business rose 220 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In America, they have now overtaken its sales to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Managing this business while building its own portal, where its
news will also be displayed, will be awkward.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, whereas Reuters had a stranglehold on much of the
wholesale business, the retail business is fiercely competitive.
And some of the other companies moving in have advantages that
Reuters does not.
</P>
<P>
   Big brokers moving online can offer a wealth of analysis and
research that Reuters lacks, which is why it has also announced a
partnership with Multex, an equity-research company.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies have powerful promotional vehicles such as the
Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Reuters have that nobody else does? A huge
international network of journalists, collecting both stories and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of the business has been looked down upon by the
financial-product people for 20 years, but the company is beginning
to see that nobody else has such an extensive news-gathering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike all the other companies getting into the retail
business, Reuters does everything _ it reports, analyzes, offers
real-time prices and dealing _ and it operates in 23 languages.
</P>
<P>
   What Reuters does not have, and most of its competitors do, is a
strong brand outside the media and financial industries. Reuters
has always been a rather self-effacing organization, in a very
British sort of way. It has served the big names, rather than
trying to become one of them.
</P>
<P>
   It is run by former journalists, including Job, who is due to
retire in July 2001, and journalists are trained to hate hype. But
if you are running a retail business, that is not a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters needs a salesman behind the counter. &QL;

information. In the past, sellers of real-time financial
information (such as the New York Stock Exchange) had to go through
an intermediary (such as Reuters) to get to the buyers of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Now companies such as CityNet, which has developed a protocol
for sending financial information instantaneously over the
Internet, allow exchanges and others producing financial
information to bypass the intermediary and sell their information
direct to the end-user _ at much lower cost. &QL;

   Reuters has had no coherent answer to this, until now, and
investors have not been happy.
</P>
<P>
   After a particularly unfortunate briefing last September, when
analysts wanted to hear a strategy articulated and Job made it
clear that he didn't have one, the share price plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reuters has come up with its answer: to go with the flow. If
the Internet disintermediates wholesalers, then Reuters will move
from being a wholesaler to being a retailer, and use the Internet
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it used to sell its information to hundreds of
thousands, down its dedicated lines. The Internet allows it to sell
to millions. ``There are upwards of 60 million people who can be
considered as targets,'' said Job. &QL;

<P>
   Reuters will go after these people in three main ways. As well
as its high-end product, it will offer several tiers of service,
with the cheapest product $100 a month or less.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet is launching an online retail service in April. And
Reuters.com will become a financial portal to offer all sorts of
products to retail investors.
</P>
<P>
   The core business, meanwhile, will be reorganized at a cost of
Pounds300 million ($480 million) to deliver its products according
to the protocols used by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A joint venture announced on Feb. 3 with Equant, a telecoms
company, will establish a secure IP-based network. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The markets liked the strategy. Nevertheless, it creates
problems for Reuters, as well as solving them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reuters wants to get into the retail business, it will
go on being a wholesaler, because that is where its revenues come
from. But if Reuters succeeds as a retailer, it is bound to
cannibalize its own revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, as Job said in his presentation, is ``to be the
provider of the information and the capabilities that allow people
to ramp up their activities on the Internet.'' But the more
individuals ``ramp up,'' the worse it is for the brokers and banks
who buy Reuters' high-end products.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, similarly, Reuters has made a good business out
of selling its news services to Web sites _ 900 of them. Its
revenues from this business rose 220 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In America, they have now overtaken its sales to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Managing this business while building its own portal, where its
news will also be displayed, will be awkward.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, whereas Reuters had a stranglehold on much of the
wholesale business, the retail business is fiercely competitive.
And some of the other companies moving in have advantages that
Reuters does not.
</P>
<P>
   Big brokers moving online can offer a wealth of analysis and
research that Reuters lacks, which is why it has also announced a
partnership with Multex, an equity-research company.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies have powerful promotional vehicles such as the
Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Reuters have that nobody else does? A huge
international network of journalists, collecting both stories and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of the business has been looked down upon by the
financial-product people for 20 years, but the company is beginning
to see that nobody else has such an extensive news-gathering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike all the other companies getting into the retail
business, Reuters does everything _ it reports, analyzes, offers
real-time prices and dealing _ and it operates in 23 languages.
</P>
<P>
   What Reuters does not have, and most of its competitors do, is a
strong brand outside the media and financial industries. Reuters
has always been a rather self-effacing organization, in a very
British sort of way. It has served the big names, rather than
trying to become one of them.
</P>
<P>
   It is run by former journalists, including Job, who is due to
retire in July 2001, and journalists are trained to hate hype. But
if you are running a retail business, that is not a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters needs a salesman behind the counter. &QL;

   GUADALAJARA, MEXICO _ At first glance, the electronics factory
near Guadalajara looks like any other. On the gym-sized shop floor,
robots fit circuit boards with components. Workers put the finished
boards in plastic casings.
</P>
<P>
   But look more closely and you might notice something odd. One of
the lines churns out Web TV set-top boxes, which connect television
with the Net, for Philips, a Dutch consumer-electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
   The line next to it makes the same device for Sony, Philips's
arch-rival. That is because the plant is run by Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a trend sweeping electronics: factories for hire.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unnoticed by consumers, contract manufacturers such as
Flextronics, Solectron, SCI, Celestica, Jabil and hundreds of
smaller contract firms have taken about 11 percent of the market
for electronics hardware, according to Technology Forecasters, a
market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Forecasters expects this figure almost to double in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of contract manufacturing is growing by more than 20
percent a year, which is more than twice as quickly as the
electronics industry as whole.
</P>
<P>
   The business is taking off in Europe, too. Ericsson, a Swedish
telecoms-equipment firm, is outsourcing its manufacturing. Fujitsu
Siemens Computers recently sold a German factory to Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturers are rapidly consolidating. Last year saw
more than 100 mergers, up from 50 in 1997. Analysts expect the
business ultimately to be dominated by half-a-dozen firms, each
with revenues of at least $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron, the world's largest, expects to be a $20 billion
company by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers have caught Wall Street's eye. The shares of
contract manufacturers have in recent years outperformed other
high-tech firms _ no mean feat. Analysts predict that they will
extend their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron is now worth over $23 billion, more than darlings of
the media such as Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics firms, like firms in other industries, have always
contracted out some of their manufacturing, mostly to assemblers of
circuit boards, whose role was mainly to supply labor when demand
was tight.
</P>
<P>
   IBM pioneered the idea of outsourcing entire products in the
1980s by getting SCI to build its personal computers. But the
exception of a decade ago is increasingly the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Today's contractors are no longer bottom-feeders, but fully
fledged supply-chain managers. They help design products to make
them easy to manufacture. They buy components. Sometimes they even
organize distribution and repair.
</P>
<P>
   These ``electronic-manufacturing services providers'' (EMS), as
they like to be called, are their customers' allies as well as mere
suppliers. The constant threat of losing orders keeps them
improving quality and service. But both parties must also work
together, building prototypes and smoothing the kinks out of the
production process.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, financial and technical integration
between customers and suppliers is growing. Most electronics firms
enjoy complete access to their contractors' books for their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard can check on the Web in real time whether its
printers are being made properly, and immediately act if they
aren't. Contractors have direct and up-to-the minute access to
their customers' sales information.
</P>
<P>
   It was only with standardized communications, digital design and
quality norms that firms could split innovation from production.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients at Flextronics's Mexican plant send files with
design changes using a data network. These are then fed into the
production robots.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturing has also grown thanks to improvements on
the shop floor. High-tech gear is no longer put together in a
low-tech way by hordes of young women wielding soldering irons.
They could not possibly pack electronic components densely enough
for today's small mobile-phones or video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work now uses surface-mount technology _ robots that
place components directly on a circuit board, without wiring and
soldering. Because these robots are expensive and complex, their
operation is best left to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Experts know how to use them efficiently, thanks to high
production volumes and varied experience. Contractors also get huge
volume discounts from components suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, contract manufacturing today is less about cutting
costs than about getting products to market quickly. If necessary,
firms can ramp up production within weeks, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron and Flextronics, for example, each have two dozen
factories around the world. If demand in one market surges, they
can literally fly in an entire production line from somewhere
else. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Flexibility helps electronics firms cope with technological
change. Because a market leader can suddenly fall from favor,
contracting out manufacturing is less risky than building new
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors also let their customers concentrate on what matters
in electronics these days: innovation. Will all electronic gear be
made by contractors? Not if they misjudge their acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors may already have acquired more firms than they can
digest. They risk becoming unfocused. And even if they do not,
electronics firms have good reason to keep at least some production
in-house for their core products and brands.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, for example, tends to build its own networking gear

   There will be more firms like Handspring, a company based in
Silicon Valley that looks as if it is about to become a force in
handheld computers, despite its lack of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting could also pose problems for European and Japanese
firms, which tend to have a strong manufacturing culture.
</P>
<P>
   To stay competitive, they may need to oursource more of their
production, too. And they may have no choice but to turn to
American suppliers, because the global contractors are all based
there.

<P>
   GUADALAJARA, MEXICO _ At first glance, the electronics factory
near Guadalajara looks like any other. On the gym-sized shop floor,
robots fit circuit boards with components. Workers put the finished
boards in plastic casings.
</P>
<P>
   But look more closely and you might notice something odd. One of
the lines churns out Web TV set-top boxes, which connect television
with the Net, for Philips, a Dutch consumer-electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
   The line next to it makes the same device for Sony, Philips's
arch-rival. That is because the plant is run by Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a trend sweeping electronics: factories for hire.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unnoticed by consumers, contract manufacturers such as
Flextronics, Solectron, SCI, Celestica, Jabil and hundreds of
smaller contract firms have taken about 11 percent of the market
for electronics hardware, according to Technology Forecasters, a
market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Forecasters expects this figure almost to double in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of contract manufacturing is growing by more than 20
percent a year, which is more than twice as quickly as the
electronics industry as whole.
</P>
<P>
   The business is taking off in Europe, too. Ericsson, a Swedish
telecoms-equipment firm, is outsourcing its manufacturing. Fujitsu
Siemens Computers recently sold a German factory to Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturers are rapidly consolidating. Last year saw
more than 100 mergers, up from 50 in 1997. Analysts expect the
business ultimately to be dominated by half-a-dozen firms, each
with revenues of at least $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron, the world's largest, expects to be a $20 billion
company by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers have caught Wall Street's eye. The shares of
contract manufacturers have in recent years outperformed other
high-tech firms _ no mean feat. Analysts predict that they will
extend their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron is now worth over $23 billion, more than darlings of
the media such as Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics firms, like firms in other industries, have always
contracted out some of their manufacturing, mostly to assemblers of
circuit boards, whose role was mainly to supply labor when demand
was tight.
</P>
<P>
   IBM pioneered the idea of outsourcing entire products in the
1980s by getting SCI to build its personal computers. But the
exception of a decade ago is increasingly the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Today's contractors are no longer bottom-feeders, but fully
fledged supply-chain managers. They help design products to make
them easy to manufacture. They buy components. Sometimes they even
organize distribution and repair.
</P>
<P>
   These ``electronic-manufacturing services providers'' (EMS), as
they like to be called, are their customers' allies as well as mere
suppliers. The constant threat of losing orders keeps them
improving quality and service. But both parties must also work
together, building prototypes and smoothing the kinks out of the
production process.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, financial and technical integration
between customers and suppliers is growing. Most electronics firms
enjoy complete access to their contractors' books for their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard can check on the Web in real time whether its
printers are being made properly, and immediately act if they
aren't. Contractors have direct and up-to-the minute access to
their customers' sales information.
</P>
<P>
   It was only with standardized communications, digital design and
quality norms that firms could split innovation from production.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients at Flextronics's Mexican plant send files with
design changes using a data network. These are then fed into the
production robots.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturing has also grown thanks to improvements on
the shop floor. High-tech gear is no longer put together in a
low-tech way by hordes of young women wielding soldering irons.
They could not possibly pack electronic components densely enough
for today's small mobile-phones or video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work now uses surface-mount technology _ robots that
place components directly on a circuit board, without wiring and
soldering. Because these robots are expensive and complex, their
operation is best left to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Experts know how to use them efficiently, thanks to high
production volumes and varied experience. Contractors also get huge
volume discounts from components suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, contract manufacturing today is less about cutting
costs than about getting products to market quickly. If necessary,
firms can ramp up production within weeks, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron and Flextronics, for example, each have two dozen
factories around the world. If demand in one market surges, they
can literally fly in an entire production line from somewhere
else. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Flexibility helps electronics firms cope with technological
change. Because a market leader can suddenly fall from favor,
contracting out manufacturing is less risky than building new
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors also let their customers concentrate on what matters
in electronics these days: innovation. Will all electronic gear be
made by contractors? Not if they misjudge their acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors may already have acquired more firms than they can
digest. They risk becoming unfocused. And even if they do not,
electronics firms have good reason to keep at least some production
in-house for their core products and brands.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, for example, tends to build its own networking gear
until it is no longer a premium product. But there is no reason why
contracting should not become the norm. &QL;

   Tim Sturgeon, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, predicts that the electronics industry will
``vertically disintegrate.'' Traditional firms will focus on R&AMP;D
and marketing; manufacturing will be a service provided by global
suppliers. &QL;

   Probably the best example of such a virtual electronics firm is
Cisco, which makes Internet-routing gear. Although the company is
easily the market leader, it has only three plants, for its
high-end equipment and prototypes. One or other of the big contract
manufacturers makes everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cisco products are never even touched by a Cisco employee.
``Without the Internet none of it would be possible,'' explains
Carl Redfield, who runs Cisco's manufacturing and logistical
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's suppliers post quotes and forecasts on Cisco's Web site
to create a form of real-time bidding. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If contract manufacturing does come to dominate electronics, the
industry will look very different. Start-ups will no longer need
factories to compete with the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more firms like Handspring, a company based in
Silicon Valley that looks as if it is about to become a force in
handheld computers, despite its lack of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting could also pose problems for European and Japanese
firms, which tend to have a strong manufacturing culture.
</P>
<P>
   To stay competitive, they may need to oursource more of their
production, too. And they may have no choice but to turn to
American suppliers, because the global contractors are all based
there.
</P>
<P>
   Having come up with the modern corporation, Sturgeon argues,
America is now about to give the world the ``turnkey production
network.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, contract manufacturing looks like the next
big strategic fad. It is furthest advanced in electronics, but it
is also growing in other industries such as toys, clothing, and
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, one day, even today's car makers will become virtual
companies. A fantasy? Last August, Ford announced that it will ask
a big supplier to run its new factory in Brazil. &QL;

   A rise in the legal age of marriage from 15 to 18; polygamy only
with the express permission of a man's first wife; an equal right
to divorce, and a fair division of assets between the separating
parties. What could sound more reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, however, these very notions are enough to have wise
men warning of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The end of January 2000 will go down as when the new Moroccan
revolution was obliged to wake up to reality.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Islamic activists shouted down ministers at meetings
in the capital, Rabat. And when a government plan to haul the
treatment of women from the Middle Ages to somewhere near the 21st
century became the litmus test of King Mohammed VI's ambitions for
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of the most stable Arab countries has become the
latest battleground between modernizers and the forces of
conservative Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Little was expected from a shy and untested crown prince,
Mohammed, when he succeeded Hassan II last July. But in the few
months since, ``M-6'' has transformed the mood of his country.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed the return from exile of Abraham Serfaty, the
country's most prominent dissident and erstwhile political
prisoner, and then sacked his father's dreaded interior minister,
Drissi Basri.
</P>
<P>
   He has twice already travelled to the desperately poor Rif
region, the largest source of cannabis for Europe where 90 percent
of the population is illiterate _ and where Hassan II never deigned
to set foot in his 38 years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   On the Western Sahara dispute, which has weighed on Moroccan
international relations for a quarter of a century, the king hints
at a new flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Unprecedented in the Arab world, he has launched a commission to
probe human-rights abuses, above all the disappearance without
trial of hundreds of political dissidents into Basri's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Long muzzled, the Moroccan press is enjoying a previously
unknown freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the 36-year-old king has governed by dramatic gesture
_ none more dramatic than last November's sacking of Basri, ``the
top cop of the kingdom'' who for 20 years had been Hassan II's iron
fist.
</P>
<P>
   But the clash with militant Islam over women's emancipation will
be a first, perhaps decisive challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fails,'' Prime Minister Abderrahman Youssoufi recently
warned a visitor, ``the whole reform project fails.''
</P>
<P>
   Morocco, mercifully, is not Algeria. A different history,
culture, and ethnic composition make any rerun of the ghastly civil
war which has engulfed its neighbor unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But if Morocco's Islamists are a minority, they are a determined
one. They have the backing of conservatives in Youssoufi's
eight-party coalition, and a natural recruiting ground in the
mosques and universities. And Morocco's dire economic problems give
them ammunition galore.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients which have stoked Islamic movements elsewhere in
the Arab world are only too visible here also: massive
unemployment, $19 billion of foreign debt whose mere servicing
consumes a third of the annual budget, rampant corruption and vast
disparities between a tiny, super-wealthy elite and masses who live
in grinding poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The overall illiteracy rate is 50 percent; as many live on
(pounds sterling)1 ($1.60) a day or less. Among women in the
countryside, deprived of schooling, jobs and basic legal rights,
those figures rise to 80 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   This is the background of the battle over Morocco's women, and
the family code, the moudawana, which enchains them.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists are claiming for all they are worth that
emancipation of women as envisaged would lead to the collapse of
the family, the destruction of Islamic values, and debauchery of
every sort.
</P>
<P>
   And the government is by no means sure of victory. Hamstrung by
differences within its own ranks, it has not dared to challenge the
Islamists head-on.
</P>
<P>
   And, as one former provincial governor wondered, ``Who do the
peasantry more easily identify with _ the religious parties, or a
Westernized governing elite which has scant experience of how they
actually live?''
</P>
<P>
   Once more, all roads lead back to the king, change's best
guarantee. The youth of Mohammed VI and his closest aides could be
a vital asset in a country 50 percent of whose population is under
25.
</P>
<P>
   But not only does he wield vast temporal powers in his
semi-feudal kingdom. He is also Morocco's supreme religious
authority: the Commander of the Faithful, the Sword of the Lord on
Earth, directly descended from the Prophet, and such a man
religious activists will take on at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   To show his commitment to Islam, the king has grown a beard
since he ascended the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father who survived at least two attempted military
coups against him, the king so far has the full loyalty of the army
and the police: without it, he could never last.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan to help women will be his sternest test. ``I am not
exaggerating,'' insists Serfaty, ``this is capable of leading us
into civil war.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Fans of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs can
thank Henry Heins, a retired Lutheran minister, for some new
reading material.
</P>
<P>
   It was Heins who helped bring into print recently two
unpublished Burroughs works, a 1924 novel, ``Marcia of the
Doorstep,'' and a 1927 play, ``You Lucky Girl!'' With introductions
written by Heins, the pair of never-before-published books are
available now in a $60 deluxe limited edition with slipcase or $30
for a standard hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   What began for Heins as a boyhood fascination with the prolific
writer's books blossomed into a middle-age obsession and, at 76,
has finally come to fruition for the former pastor of St. Mark's
Lutheran Church in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels nice to see them in print,'' Heins said. ``I feel
like I nurtured them along for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime, actually.
</P>
<P>
   When Heins was an elementary school student in New York City,
his parents rewarded each A in his report card with a new Burroughs
book. Heins was a good student and his stack of Burroughs grew.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Burroughs died in 1950 at age 74 in Encino, Calif.,
he had become one of the most popular writers of his generation. He
churned out nearly 60 books in a variety of genres from a
science-fiction series on Mars to Hollywood pulp fiction to the
wildly successful Tarzan stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books have enduring appeal because their simple plots and
easy language made them accessible to kids, but they're also good
escapist fiction for adults,'' said Heins, who continues to read
Burroughs seven decades after first encountering the guilty
pleasure of the author's low-brow style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eventually had to tell the members of my church I had this
offbeat interest,'' Heins said. ``They accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   The clergyman's interest was almost derailed early on. When
Heins went to seminary school, his parents cleaned out his room and
tossed out boxes of his Burroughs books. Heins has since collected
valuable first editions of every Burroughs title, which he keeps in
meticulous condition in a cluttered basement office alongside a
model-train layout and books on railroad history.
</P>
<P>
   One volume that didn't get discarded by his parents is a first
edition of the 1938 ``Tarzan and the Forbidden City.'' It sold for
$2 at the time and now fetches a hundred or more times that.
Burroughs inscribed the book to the young Heins, who regrets he
never met his literary idol. The inscription was part of a
mail-order-book-club arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The long prologue to Heins' assistance in discovering two
unpublished Burroughs manuscripts began in earnest in 1962, when
Heins was researching an unrelated project at New York State
Library. He stumbled across an archive of Library of Congress
catalog cards that had never been printed, including a year-by-year
Catalogue of Copyright Entries.
</P>
<P>
   Heins immersed himself in those remote stacks for months and
emerged with his first book, ``Golden Anniversary Bibliography of
Edgar Rice Burroughs.'' It was published in 1964 by Donald M.
Grant, a small publisher in Hampton Falls, N.H. Fans snapped up all
1,000 copies of Heins' detailed documentation of Burroughs' writing
at $10 apiece in a few months. (The out-of-print bibliography now
sells for $200 to $300.) With his royalties from the bibliography,
Heins bought a manual Royal typewriter he's still using.
</P>
<P>
   Heins' archival digging uncovered the unknown ``You Lucky
Girl!'' Burroughs copyrighted the love story in three acts under
number D81617 on Nov. 3, 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Heins corresponded about his discovery with Hulbert Burroughs,
the author's son, who invited Heins to investigate the family safe
in the Burroughs compound at Tarzana, Calif. ``Hulbert and I were
sitting on the floor in front of the open safe,'' Heins recalled of
the visit in 1963. ``We had a pile of manuscripts we'd pulled out
and there was the play in a small binder of 78 pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Heins later learned that Burroughs wrote ``You Lucky Girl!'' for
his daughter, Joan, an aspiring actress, in an attempt to boost her
career. The plan failed and the play, the only drama Burroughs
completed, was forgotten. It was staged for the first time at the
Palmdale Playhouse in California in 1997, after Burroughs' daughter
had died.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, nearly 40 years after his find, Heins shared in the
achievement by being asked by the publisher (Donald M. Grant again)
to autograph the endpapers of 1,000 copies of the deluxe limited
edition of ``You Lucky Girl!'' along with Burroughs' grandson,
Danton Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's simultaneous publication of ``Marcia of the Doorstep''
(Burroughs' longest book at 125,000 words, a novel of blackmail and
high society bridging Broadway and Hollywood) is more interesting
to Heins for its historical significance than its literary merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play and the novel are OK, but I still think his Mars
series is the best,'' Heins said. ``I enjoyed the Tarzan books, but
the movies cheapened them.''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heins' wife of 51 years, Marie, does not share her husband's
fascination with Burroughs. ``I've tried to read him a few times,
but his books never held my attention and I couldn't finish,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she devours two or three science-fiction or
historical-fiction volumes each week, particularly the books of
Anne McCaffrey and Andre Norton. The Heins' modest bungalow
overflows with thousands of books _ hers on the main floor and his
in the basement and filling 14 bookcases in the attic. Roaming
among the shelves of books are two cats, Lady and Contessa.
</P>
<P>
   Heins' devotion to Burroughs has been recognized by the writer's
legion of fans, who have posted dozens of Web sites to honor the
author. They also produce a Burroughs newsletter, Fan Directory.
</P>
<P>
   Heins was presented with a plaque in 1990 by Burroughs
Bibliophiles, a fan group, for ``outstanding achievement and
devotion to the memory of Edgar Rice Burroughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Heins' boost in getting the lost manuscripts published was a way
of repaying that honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for the fans,'' Heins said.

<P>
   A rise in the legal age of marriage from 15 to 18; polygamy only
with the express permission of a man's first wife; an equal right
to divorce, and a fair division of assets between the separating
parties. What could sound more reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, however, these very notions are enough to have wise
men warning of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The end of January 2000 will go down as when the new Moroccan
revolution was obliged to wake up to reality.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Islamic activists shouted down ministers at meetings
in the capital, Rabat. And when a government plan to haul the
treatment of women from the Middle Ages to somewhere near the 21st
century became the litmus test of King Mohammed VI's ambitions for
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of the most stable Arab countries has become the
latest battleground between modernizers and the forces of
conservative Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Little was expected from a shy and untested crown prince,
Mohammed, when he succeeded Hassan II last July. But in the few
months since, ``M-6'' has transformed the mood of his country.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed the return from exile of Abraham Serfaty, the
country's most prominent dissident and erstwhile political
prisoner, and then sacked his father's dreaded interior minister,
Drissi Basri.
</P>
<P>
   He has twice already travelled to the desperately poor Rif
region, the largest source of cannabis for Europe where 90 percent
of the population is illiterate _ and where Hassan II never deigned
to set foot in his 38 years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   On the Western Sahara dispute, which has weighed on Moroccan
international relations for a quarter of a century, the king hints
at a new flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Unprecedented in the Arab world, he has launched a commission to
probe human-rights abuses, above all the disappearance without
trial of hundreds of political dissidents into Basri's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Long muzzled, the Moroccan press is enjoying a previously
unknown freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the 36-year-old king has governed by dramatic gesture
_ none more dramatic than last November's sacking of Basri, ``the
top cop of the kingdom'' who for 20 years had been Hassan II's iron
fist.
</P>
<P>
   But the clash with militant Islam over women's emancipation will
be a first, perhaps decisive challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fails,'' Prime Minister Abderrahman Youssoufi recently
warned a visitor, ``the whole reform project fails.''
</P>
<P>
   Morocco, mercifully, is not Algeria. A different history,
culture, and ethnic composition make any rerun of the ghastly civil
war which has engulfed its neighbor unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But if Morocco's Islamists are a minority, they are a determined
one. They have the backing of conservatives in Youssoufi's
eight-party coalition, and a natural recruiting ground in the
mosques and universities. And Morocco's dire economic problems give
them ammunition galore.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients which have stoked Islamic movements elsewhere in
the Arab world are only too visible here also: massive
unemployment, $19 billion of foreign debt whose mere servicing
consumes a third of the annual budget, rampant corruption and vast
disparities between a tiny, super-wealthy elite and masses who live
in grinding poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The overall illiteracy rate is 50 percent; as many live on
(pounds sterling)1 ($1.60) a day or less. Among women in the
countryside, deprived of schooling, jobs and basic legal rights,
those figures rise to 80 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   This is the background of the battle over Morocco's women, and
the family code, the moudawana, which enchains them.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists are claiming for all they are worth that
emancipation of women as envisaged would lead to the collapse of
the family, the destruction of Islamic values, and debauchery of
every sort.
</P>
<P>
   And the government is by no means sure of victory. Hamstrung by
differences within its own ranks, it has not dared to challenge the
Islamists head-on.
</P>
<P>
   And, as one former provincial governor wondered, ``Who do the
peasantry more easily identify with _ the religious parties, or a
Westernized governing elite which has scant experience of how they
actually live?''
</P>
<P>
   Once more, all roads lead back to the king, change's best
guarantee. The youth of Mohammed VI and his closest aides could be
a vital asset in a country 50 percent of whose population is under
25.
</P>
<P>
   But not only does he wield vast temporal powers in his
semi-feudal kingdom. He is also Morocco's supreme religious
authority: the Commander of the Faithful, the Sword of the Lord on
Earth, directly descended from the Prophet, and such a man
religious activists will take on at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   To show his commitment to Islam, the king has grown a beard
since he ascended the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father who survived at least two attempted military
coups against him, the king so far has the full loyalty of the army
and the police: without it, he could never last.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan to help women will be his sternest test. ``I am not
exaggerating,'' insists Serfaty, ``this is capable of leading us
into civil war.'' &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ When are a woman's breasts politically correct,
and when are they just downright offensive?
</P>
<P>
   The question has been blowing up a fair storm in San Francisco,
a city whose billboards are plastered with the usual array of
oversized mammary glands.
</P>
<P>
   But one specific billboard, for a particularly graphic
advertising campaign promoting breast-cancer awareness, has run the
gauntlet of controversy, censorship and a much-ballyhooed outcry
over civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, sponsored by a local group called The Breast
Cancer Fund, set out to be deliberately shocking by superimposing
images of mastectomy scars on the chests of glamour models.
</P>
<P>
   One is made to look like the cover of Cosmopolitan, with the
word ``Mastectomy'' written in place of the magazine title.
</P>
<P>
   Another sends up the ad for the Calvin Klein perfume Obsession,
with the words ``Obsessed With Breasts'' replacing the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the ads started appearing at bus stations
in the suburban communities to the east and south of San Francisco
and were intended to be introduced into the city as well. But then
the furor broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by a handful of complaints from the public, transport
companies and billboard firms removed the posters on the grounds
not only that they were offensive but that they risked causing
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in San Francisco, the company that had volunteered to
distribute them for free suddenly got cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it _ a four-by-six-foot picture of a woman's
torso and you see these two bare red scars, I mean, to see a
woman's terribly, terribly scarred body _ it's just not for public
consumption,'' said Lew Lillian, head of the billboard firm Outdoor
Systems. ``It's too shocking. Too upsetting. Too provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ads have proven to be nowhere near as provocative as the
attempt to suppress them. Lillian's decision provoked a torrent of
protest, from the local media and the San Francisco branch of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Martin, the founder of The Breast Cancer Fund whose own
mastectomy scars are the ones featured in the ads, decried what she
called an attempt ``to hide fundamental aspects of this disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand how you can have boobs pictured all over
the place, pardon the expression, and not show one very real side
of breast cancer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a couple of days ago, a rival billboard firm called Eller
Media stepped in and volunteered to post the images in Lillian's
place. They will be going up on about five billboards as soon as
space becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sweet victory for the voice of liberal justice in a city
virtually built on such sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to protect the residents of San Francisco from a
shocking sight on the streets is kind of like protecting the folks
in Los Angeles from smog,'' commented local columnist Ken Garcia.
``You can try. You will fail.'' &QL;

   The unpredictable governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura,
announced Friday that he is taking his state's Reform Party out of
the national organization to protest against the infighting that
has plagued it in recent months. The problem for the Reform Party
now, though, is not just the fallout from the rivalry between its
two big personalities, Ventura and founder Ross Perot. While they
squabbled, the party's platform has been hijacked by challengers
John McCain and Bill Bradley. &QL;

<P>
   The unpredictable governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura,
announced Friday that he is taking his state's Reform Party out of
the national organization to protest against the infighting that
has plagued it in recent months. The problem for the Reform Party
now, though, is not just the fallout from the rivalry between its
two big personalities, Ventura and founder Ross Perot. While they
squabbled, the party's platform has been hijacked by challengers
John McCain and Bill Bradley. &QL;

THINK TWICE ABOUT SELLING BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. My mother prefers to invest conservatively and has done
quite well with tax-exempt municipal bonds. However, the return on
these bonds has dropped significantly since the 1970s and '80s. In
reviewing her year-end statement, I noticed that each fund dropped
steadily in value per share. She ended up with an overall balance
of $33,000 _ less than at the beginning, despite reinvesting all
earnings. She currently does not need the proceeds of this account,
but it seems $500,000, conservatively invested, should do better
than a $33,000 loss. Assuming she keeps the half of the account
that's in individual bonds, how would you advise her to invest the
other half to earn 6 percent to 7 percent, while keeping the
principal out of harm's way?
</P>
<P>
   G.C., Portland, Ore. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your mother probably had about as tough a year with her
individual municipal bond holdings as she did with her funds. I
tally an overall loss of 6.6 percent; my guess is that unless a
couple of the poorly performing funds represented a large amount of
the fund positions, there were substantial losses in the individual
bond accounts, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the funds you list (both classes of the Smith Barney High
Income fund) eked out small gains for 1999. The Class B shares of
the Smith Barney Total Return fund, with a portfolio of long-term
bonds, lost 6.3 percent. Smith Barney Managed Municipals (which is
what I presume you meant by Smith Barney Managed) lost 7.7 percent,
also with a long-term portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Total Return fund, which is not rated by
Morningstar, compare to an average loss of 2.8 percent for its peer
funds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Managed Municipals fund also compared
unfavorably to an average loss of 4.8 percent for its peers. But
that's not necessarily mismanagement. As Morningstar Mutual Funds
puts it, the fund makes aggressive interest-rate plays, and its
longer-term trailing returns are among the muni national long
category's best.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these two money-losing funds represented positions of
nearly $125,000 each, the combined loss they delivered would be
only about half of the total portfolio loss for the year. And when
you factor in the gains from the High-Yield funds, even more of the
red ink must be spread among the individual municipal bond
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unhappy results, I would think twice about selling.
With Class B holdings, your mother would face a redemption charge
of up to 4.5 percent if she sold, with the level of the charge
depending on how long she has held the positions. She could,
indeed, achieve a safe yield in the 6 percent to 7 percent range _
the highest rate in the nation for a five-year jumbo bank CD was
7.7 percent entering this week _ but if she sells she'll lose the
chance to recoup some of her losses.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see any particular prospect for a short-term rebound in
the bond markets. But I think our record economic expansion will
end sooner rather than later, and once that becomes certain, the
remedy will be lower interest rates _ which rewards the owners of
bond funds. And such funds can be as volatile on the upside as they
are when interest rates go against them. Since your mother doesn't
rely on income from these funds, she can afford to wait until the
worm turns in the bond market _ and in the meantime, avoid the
galling prospect of paying a redemption fee on funds that have been
losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at some of the individual municipal bond accounts,
which generated a good deal of the red ink. These holdings can be
sold without fees anywhere near the size of redemption fees for the
funds, so one of them may be a good candidate for being swapped
into a CD position.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does a defined-benefit lifetime pension negate the need for a
bond portfolio? My husband and I married two years ago and have no
dependents. Current living expenses are $65,000 to $75,000, apart
from taxes; we'd like to increase this to $75,000 or more in
retirement, if our portfolio is up to it. Are we on track to retire
at 53? Do we need a bond portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   N.G., San Luis Obispo, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems you'll be in very nice shape to retire at 53. You
can certainly forget about a bond portfolio for quite a few years.
In eight years, with contributions at current levels _ including
some estimates on my part for contributions to 401(k) and 403(b)
plans _ your savings would grow from $259,248 currently to $998,325
_ provided your portfolio has average annual growth of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since your combined pensions would supply a little more than
$65,000 _ the lower end of your current spending estimate _ all you
will need from your portfolio at retirement is cash to boost your
income a bit and to deal with taxes. You might handle that upon
retirement or shortly before, by moving about a quarter of the
total accumulation _ specifically, funds in the tax-deferred
accounts _ into fixed-income holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Since you will meet your targets with such a wide margin, it
seems silly to think about buying fixed-income holdings at this
point. Your position with all of your savings in stocks is
aggressive, but your portfolio is nicely diversified. And with
those pensions looming, you can afford to ride out the vagaries of
the stock markets. So I suggest no change at all.
</P>
<P>
   I do wonder about the large difference in the dollar value of
your pension at ages 53 and 55. To most people, it would probably
seem worth chugging away at the old job for another two years to
get a $13,000 annual increase in your lifetime pension, complete
with annual adjustments. (Might I suspect a typo somewhere in your
letter?)
</P>
<P>
   In any event, wait until you're about 50, and then survey the
situation. Decide then if working the extra two years is worth the
extra $13,000, and calculate how much money in addition to your
pensions you might need. If you decide to retire at 53, you could
slowly develop the fixed-income side; if you decide to hang on to
age 55, you could wait a few years and then reassess. It could be
that if you retired at age 55 you would have very little or no need
of any bond holdings.
</P>
<P>
   I hasten to add that the luxury of holding no fixed-income
assets is generally limited to people with substantial assets _ and
those two pensions represent very substantial assets. For most
people, whether or not they will draw upon retirement savings
immediately upon retirement, the element of risk becomes a large
part of the formula. They may be able to forgo the yield from bond
holdings, but they can't accept the risk that goes with an
all-stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money Musings: The stock market, at least as estimated by the
Standard and Poor's 500 Index, has not suffered a losing election
year since 1960.

THE MAGIC NUMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So, what's the number? Not the lottery pick, but the financial
peace of mind number _ call it the magic number _ that allows a
person to look at the monthly bank and investment statements and
say: ``Whew. I made it. Now I can relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic number used to be $1 million. For many people it still
is, although that pile has lost some of its luster, now that TV
game show contestants are raking it in so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy investors, though, are doing the same in the soaring stock
market, which has encouraged a kind of casino mentality. The dice
are definitely rattling in stratospheric circles, where high
rollers call their magic number a ``hunge'' _ short for $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Low-rollers may think they could be outrageously comfortable
with half a hunge, or a quarter, or a couple of million. But maybe
that's only because they don't have it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Magic numbers are tricky. They slide around. They expand and
contract with weather and mood swings and new bank balances.
Today's good life can easily become tomorrow's ``not exactly,'' as
people who always thought they'd be happy making $2 million find
they aren't. Or as investors who were once delighted with a 10 or
15 percent return now figure they're losers if they don't make at
least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not money management,'' says a sales manager, describing
his work at the Boston offices of a top Wall Street investment
banking and brokerage firm. ``This business is about managing
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows people who have no money in their checking accounts and
who put it all in stocks, because that's what makes them feel
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard of people taking out second mortgages to invest in
technology start-ups. ``People have unbelievably diluted
conceptions as to what normal is,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   For him, peace of mind is having six months' to a year's worth
of mortgage payments on hand in a liquid account, such as a money
market account or Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   For Larry DiCara, a former Boston city councilor who's now a
partner at Nixon Peabody, peace of mind will mean being able to put
away $1 million dollars, after taxes, by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``round number'' his financial adviser came up with
when DiCara wanted to know what it would cost to put his triplets
through college. ``That's a lot,'' he says glumly, noting that he
worked his way through Harvard University when tuition was about
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some people define their financial comfort zone in the
vernacular. The polite version is ``take a hike money,'' which
allows a person to walk away from a job, a relationship, or
whatever situation deserves the epithet.
</P>
<P>
   The amount one needs to walk depends on lifestyle and on the
next step: retirement or another job.
</P>
<P>
   John Spooner, an investment adviser at Salomon Smith Barney Inc.
in Boston, says someone who needs $75,000 a year after taxes must
put $1.5 million in the pot, meaning liquid assets and investments.
</P>
<P>
   Another financial planner offered this rule of thumb: Figure
$100,000 a year after taxes and multiply it by expected life span.
A person age 65 multiplying the $100,000 by 20 would need $2
million in the pot. A 55-year-old would need $2.5 to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may find these numbers impossibly big _ and
depressing _ and choose to seek financial comfort in much smaller
goals: keeping a $500 cushion in the checking account, not letting
a credit card balance go over $1,000, putting $20 a week in the
cookie jar till there is $100 to invest.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the magic number is not a number at all, but an
achievement: founding a company and taking it public, making
partner at the firm, getting the degree, a better job offer, or
finally having some free time.
</P>
<P>
   What's the number? The answer is in the eye of the calculator.
The work sheet is in the psyche, and the math is optional.

 LONDON: ... notably philistine.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, architects have two options when converting
existing buildings into art museums. They can leave as much as
possible of what's already there: old brick walls, old machinery
that suddenly takes on a sculptural air, even old layers of paint,
to suggest the structure's past. Or they can gut the place, erasing
prior identities. With some exceptions, Swiss architects Herzog &AMP;
de Meuron are taking the latter route in transforming the interior
of the former Bankside Power Station. ``Power'' describes the
building's architecture as well as its original output. Designed in
1947 by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (also the designer of Britain's
famous red telephone booth), its heftiness is relieved by jazzy
verticals on its exterior and an immensely tall chimney, the visual
signature that dominates its Thames-side site.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the huge scale that artists prefer nowadays,
especially in installations, Bankside is being turned into a series
of 81 gargantuan galleries, one a double-height space with a
40-foot ceiling, many with white walls and pale oak floors. At the
moment, still under construction, they look like generic
contemporary art spaces. A new glass box on the sixth and seventh
levels of the building will, among other things, house a restaurant
with spectacular views of St. Paul's and other London landmarks. A
pedestrian bridge by architect Norman Foster and sculptor Anthony
Caro will link the two sides of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Chunky steel beams painted licorice black are among the few
holdovers from the building's past. The biggest reminder, though,
is the biggest space _ the ground floor's Turbine Hall, a 500-foot
expanse, which makes it 50 feet longer than the vast boat-shaped
gallery at the Guggenheim Bilbao. It may well be the world's
largest permanent indoor space for art. Turbine Hall will serve as
the new museum's main entrance and a space for immense sculptures.
Thanks to a $2 million grant from Unilever, the Tate will
commission one new work a year for the Hall for the next five
years, the first by the 87-year-old American sculptor Louise
Bourgeois. Thanks to a rolling gantry at the top of the Hall, quite
a site in itself, workers will be able to move the giant pieces.

<P>
   Wide range of exhibits

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The mix of exhibitions at the Tate Millbank during my recent
visit gives a clue to the immense popularity of the place. There
are always the Turner paintings, of course, the main draw for
first-timers. The temporary shows I saw included the Turner Prize
exhibition, featuring work by McQueen, Emin, Steven Pippin, and
Jane and Louise Wilson. (Work by the Wilson sisters is currently on
view at MIT's List Visual Arts Center.) ``The Art of Bloomsbury,''
now finished at the Tate but coming to the Yale Center for British
Art in New Haven in May, attempts to show that the movement most
closely associated with Virginia Woolf and her fellow writers was
equally strong in the visual arts, thanks, in the beginning, to
painter-theorist Roger Fry going gaga over French painting and
subsequently shaking up British art.
</P>
<P>
   Most inventive of all the shows was ``At Home With Art,'' for
which nine leading British sculptors, including Anish Kapoor and
Richard Deacon, created practical household objects, wall pegs to
shower curtains, meant for mass production. Most intriguing of the
shows, and a particular favorite of Christoph Grunenberg's, is
``Mark Dion: Tate Thames Dig,'' up through Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, an American who is part artist, part scientist, led a team
of volunteers on a beachcombing excavation by the Thames at both
Millbank (once the site of a huge prison) and Bankside, which
housed brothels and bear-baiting pits in the 16th century. The
amateur archeologists collected broken centuries-old glass and
indestructible plastic; shells, bottle caps, buttons, teeth,
toothbrushes, and credit cards. They sorted, labeled, and
categorized it all, neatly installing it in a huge, 19th
century-style wooden cabinet of the sort once found in
natural-history museums. Visitors are invited to open the drawers
and doors and examine the contents, an experience that eventually
leads to an inevitable ``Yuck!'' But what a delightful way to
conjure up the history of the two London locations that are home to
one of Europe's most dynamic museums.

MOVED BY FRIENDSHIP, MCCAIN RELENTS ON FETAL-TISSUE RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ In 1992, Senator John McCain agonized over
the choice of maintaining his unblemished antiabortion voting
record or doing a favor for a friend. He followed friendship, and
the consequence is that McCain's votes to allow research on
fetal-tissue transplants have come under fire in his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Citizens for Life aired radio ads urging voters
to oppose McCain in the primary on Saturday because, the ads said,
the Arizona Republican had ``flip-flopped'' on a promise to
maintain the ban on federal funds for research ``that uses the body
parts of aborted babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the National Right to Life Committee and Citizens for
Life, its South Carolina affiliate, endorsed McCain's rival, Texas
Governor George W. Bush, in the hot South Carolina contest.
</P>
<P>
   There's no disputing that McCain was inconsistent on the
fetal-tissue issue, and that the candidate who rails against
special interests listened to a lobbyist who championed
fetal-tissue therapies. The lobbyist was Anne Udall. Her father,
former Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona was in a Veterans
Administration medical center, wasting away from the Parkinson's
disease that would kill him in December 1998 at age 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember John sitting in his office, not only
listening to me on fetal tissue but also talking about what my dad
meant to him,'' Anne Udall said. ``It was very powerful. And he
said, `If it is the right thing to do, I will do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   First-term Representative Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, says
the bond between his father, a liberal Democrat, and McCain, a
conservative Republican, transcended ideology and geography. ``I
think it was very personal for McCain, a former prisoner of war, to
see my father just wasted by this terrible disease and, over eight
years in a VA hospital, becoming half the man he was.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said ``the spectacle'' of Udall's illness had caused his
change of heart. ``I'm not supporting abortion to provide'' fetal
tissue, McCain said in a television interview. ``But the fact is,
I've been convinced that it is a promising way to find a cure for a
terrible, terrible disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, preliminary research on the use of
fetal-tissue transplants showed promise in treating incurable
diseases like diabetes and Parkinson's. The hope was that new,
young cells injected into a diseased part of the body would
generate healthy tissue. The problem was that the primary source of
the cells is induced abortions, and antiabortion activists demanded
Congress discourage the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In a January 1992 letter to the director of Arizona Right to
Life, McCain said the group could count on his being ``steadfast''
against abortion. ``I have no intention of supporting the use of
fetal tissue'' from abortions, McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, McCain voted in favor of a Senate bill
authorizing funds for the National Institutes of Health that
included a provision to lift the federal-research moratorium that
presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush had imposed on
fetal-tissue transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lost sleep struggling with this,'' McCain wrote to a
constituent in May 1992. ``My abhorrence for the practice of
abortion is unquestionable. Yet my abhorrence'' for Parkinson's and
juvenile diabetes ``and the suffering they cause is just as
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Samuelson, who has Parkinson's disease, trooped from office
to office on Capitol Hill with Anne Udall in early 1992 and
persuaded some Republicans, including senators Bob Dole of Kansas
and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina (a backer of Governor George
W. Bush), to defy the antiabortion lobby and cast what she called
``an equally pro-life vote'' in favor of fetal-tissue research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember McCain was very tortured by this,'' said Samuelson,
who is president of the Parkinson's Action Network. ``He was a
very, very hard sell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anne Udall also knew how McCain felt about her father.
``Mo'' Udall, a longtime committee chairman in the House, could
have ignored, even needled the cocky Republican from Phoenix when
he arrived as a freshman congressman in 1982. Instead, Udall
mentored, befriended, and included McCain in Arizona
decision-making. Udall also offered a model of the kind of
politician McCain would grow to be, a reform-minded maverick with a
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my dad in McCain _ not in their ideologies, which are
very different _ but in the way McCain seems willing to stand up
for what he believes and take on tough issues, like
campaign-finance reform,'' said Anne Udall, who is a school
administrator in Charlotte, N.C. ``He also seems like he can stand
back and laugh at himself and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Udall children said McCain repaid his political debt in his
dedication to their ailing father. For eight years, Mark Udall
said, McCain faithfully visited Udall at the VA medical center in
Washington, even when his father was unable to make conversation or
respond. When Udall died, McCain delivered a moving eulogy at his
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also kept his commitment to the Udall family on
fetal-tissue research. He was the chief sponsor of a bill, enacted
in 1997 and bearing Udall's name, that provides $100 million a year
for finding a cure for Parkinson's disease, a progressive
neurological disorder that afflicts about 1 million Americans. He
opposed an amendment that would have banned research on
fetal-tissue transplants.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratories, fetal-tissue transplantation has not proved as
practical or promising as once promoted, and many researchers now
call the political debate moot. ``No one feels it provides any
long-term solutions,'' said Dr. J. William Langston, president of
the Parkinson Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``The science is
taking us in a very different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those directions is research on transplanting human
embryonic cells, or stem cells. Because harvesting stem cells
usually requires destruction of embryos left over from in vitro
fertilization procedures, antiabortion groups oppose it vigorously.
Earlier this month, McCain joined 19 other senators in asking the
National Institutes of Health to withdraw its new proposals to fund
federal embryonic-cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Mosteller of Charleston, S.C., a McCain adviser on family
issues and a longtime antiabortion activist, said the senator's
positions are consistent: He would support nonembryo stem-cell
research, just as he supports fetal-tissue research, which does not
``destroy a human being.'' Mosteller said the antiabortion group's
ads against McCain are ``disingenuous'' and aimed less at his
voting record than at his push to overhaul the campaign-finance
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, South Carolina's Citizens for Life ran newspaper ads
calling Patrick J. Buchanan, Alan Keyes, and Bob Dole
``acceptable'' choices for primary voters, even though Dole, like
McCain, supported federal fetal-tissue research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's McCain's flip-flops. He says one thing on the West Coast
and then comes east and blows into the ear of Christian
conservatives and calls himself pro-life,'' said Holly Gatling,
executive director of the South Carolina Citizens for Life
political action committee. ``Bush's record as governor of Texas is
solidly pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   At two McCain town meetings in the Charleston area last week,
nobody asked about abortion, and women who voiced their opinions
afterward seemed to agree that the issue is personal.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Peggy Ferro, an X-ray technician from Summerville,
S.C., has two adopted children and a very negative view of
abortion. But because her husband is a disabled veteran, she is
much more interested in McCain's proposals to expand veterans'
benefits than in the ``very old'' debate about fetal-tissue
research.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wells of Ladson, S.C., the mother of two teenagers,
offered this: ``What I don't like is for Washington to pass laws
that are `morally correct.' I believe abortion is a personal and
family choice.''

UNREELING AN EARLY TAKE ON THE OSCARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're all clueless about the Oscars. Let's be clear about that.
Even last year, when everybody (including me) picked ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' we were wrong. And everything, every category, is
up for grabs in this year's Oscar race. Not a single clear-cut
front-runner in the lot. Which makes it more fun to guess at. So
we're doing it twice. Before we get around to guessing the winners,
there's the irresistible impulse to first guess the slate of
nominees, who'll be announced Tuesday. At least we won't have to
wait long to see how right or wrong we were. Here goes: &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST PICTURE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' is as close as we get to a certain nominee,
here as well as in the acting categories. The only question is
whether this brilliant black comedy of family dysfunction and
self-detonation is going to be this year's ``L.A. Confidential,''
uniformly praised, but perhaps a little too apocalyptic to go the
distance with the Academy. ``Being John Malkovich'' is the small
indie that seems too original to ignore, especially since the
Academy is bent on showing the world that it still is relevant. Its
original narrative techniques and envelope-pushing performances
should command what I think of as the upstart slot. ``The Cider
House Rules'' has a good shot, given the Academy's predilection for
emotion. This film has plenty of warmth, skillfully and tenderly
brought to the screen by Lasse Hallstrom. It will, I think, edge
``The Green Mile'' for the warmth slot because comparisons to ``The
Shawshank Redemption'' will cost the latter film. ``The Insider''
is too heavy-handed and misshapen to be considered a good film, but
its impeccable political correctness makes it a natural for a group
that tends to favor films that will reflect well on it and the biz
in general. ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' made some people queasy,
and it stumbles at the end, but it's so jagged with style that it's
a throwback to the days when Hollywood films shimmered with
glamour, to which the Academy could respond, to say nothing of the
film's quintet of wickedly entertaining performances. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST DIRECTOR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Usually, there's a one-to-one picture-director correspondence.
But one need only look back to last year, when Steven Spielberg
took this award, only to see ``Saving Private Ryan'' upset by
``Shakespeare in Love'' as best picture. Sam Mendes is a certain
nominee for ``American Beauty,'' a stage director who made the most
of the stage savvy of his two leads and a darkly coruscating
script. Michael Mann is good bet, not so much, frankly, for the
excellence of ``The Insider,'' as for his bold position on the
right side of the David-and-Goliath battle against Big Tobacco.
Anthony Minghella did such a sleek and sophisticated job of guiding
``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' through some tricky psychological and
geographical territory that his finesse can't be ignored. Neither
can Spike Jonze, whose reinvention of ``Alice in Wonderland'' for a
celebrity culture in ``Being John Malkovich'' make it the year's
most original film. But ``The Sixth Sense,'' which I think made too
much money to nail a best picture nomination, was too strong a
presence to be ignored. Giving its writer-director, M. Night
Shyamalan, a slot is one way to recognize it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST ACTRESS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank swept the critics' awards. The question is whether
enough Academy voters will have seen her heart-stopping performance
as a transsexual in peril in ``Boys Don't Cry,'' a small indie.
Annette Bening was a large part of the reason for the brilliance of
``American Beauty.'' Her angry, tightly wound suburban wife about
to explode is acting perfection. Sigourney Weaver has her best role
in years, perhaps ever, as a farm wife and mother whose life falls
out from under her in ``A Map of the World.'' What she's up against
is the fact that the film was distributed by a small company, which
will cost her the visibility of a big studio push. Ditto for my
next two picks. Janet McTeer is both adorable and compelling as a
loose cannon of a single mom careening cross-country from one
disastrous romance to the next, but unwavering in her love for her
teenage daughter, who's starting to tire of the whole routine, in
``Tumbleweeds.'' Frances O'Connor, the most interesting actress to
come out of Australia since Judy Davis, would be the long shot here
if she's nominated, but she's at the center of the latest
successful Austen screen adaptation, ``Mansfield Park.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST ACTOR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey is a certain nominee for his performance as a man
who escalates a midlife crisis into a personal apocalypse in
``American Beauty.'' Every moment of his performance tingles with
perverse rebellion and a sense of mischief on the way to hell.
Russell Crowe is the main reason ``The Insider'' is as powerful as
it is. Even though the film puts too much focus on the TV producer
who told his story, Crowe is riveting as the conflicted tobacco
industry insider who blew the whistle. Denzel Washington will only
add to the reservoir of career respect he's amassing for his role
as the wrongfully convicted Rubin Carter in ``The Hurricane.'' In a
remarkably internalized performance, he makes the camera come to
him as a man who survived years in prison by migrating to his own
interior. Richard Farnsworth is known as an old charmer and rightly
so. But it isn't charm that makes the ex-cowboy and stunt rider
turned actor so moving and persuasive as an aging man determined to
end a family feud in David Lynch's ``The Straight Story.'' It's
character. Whether American once stood for the integrity he seems
to embody, he persuades you it did and that straight shooting and
self-reliance are what he's all about. Matt Damon deserves a shot
for flying in the face of his golden boy persona to play a young
man who slides down the slope of corruption from opportunism to
murder in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' There's a slipperiness in
his make-it-up-as-you-go-along scheming that we didn't know he had
in him. Even his gaucherie seems calculated. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore has done too much excellent work to be ignored,
although it may not help that she spread it across several films.
Her anguished wife in ``Magnolia,'' her conflicted chum of
Sigourney Weaver in ``A Map of the World,'' and her suavely
sparkling adventuress in ``An Ideal Husband'' each would qualify
her. Put them together, and a nomination seems inevitable. One
reason Swank is as good as she is in ``Boys Don't Cry'' is because
she has Chloe Sevigny to bounce her desperate neediness off. As the
only local with enough sensitivity to empathize with Swank's
yearnings in their forlorn Nebraska backwater, she's haunting.
Angelina Jolie, a comer in any case, is the reason electricity
flies off the screen in ``Girl, Interrupted.'' Her charismatic
sociopath is a twisted force of nature you can't take your eyes
off. Catherine Keener's razory eyes-on-the-prize businesswoman is a
big part of the reason ``Being John Malkovich'' has the edge it
has. The cold sizzle in her character will probably give her the
nod over Cameron Diaz's frumped-down animal lover in the same film.
Cherry Jones is the long shot here, and it's probably wrong to
single her out from what clearly is an ensemble effort in ``Cradle
Will Rock.'' But her Hallie Flanagan shiningly restores to view an
angel of theater in the '30s, who put in place a tradition of
activism still alive today and who is embodied here with brains,
dignity, and character. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman did too much good
work in 1999 to be bypassed. Probably his starring role in
``Flawless'' shouldn't be discussed here, and his sympathetic nurse
in ``Magnolia'' was part of an ensemble performance, but his
obnoxious snob in ``Ripley'' will do very nicely as a solid
qualifier. Michael Caine is a nonstop source of heart and soul in
``The Cider House Rules,'' contributing mightily to its humanity
and tenderness. As a Maine doctor in charge of an orphanage, he
leaves us convinced that he really cares. Haley Jon Osment was the
big reason ``The Sixth Sense'' proved so haunting to so many
moviegoers. His portrayal of the boy weighed down with baleful
uninvited visions represents this film's best shot at an Oscar.
Similarly, Michael Clarke Duncan represents the best chance ``The
Green Mile'' has on Oscar night. Tom Hanks's performance as a
prison guard is excellent but understated, and Duncan's gentle
giant with mysterious powers is able to avoid the potentially
disastrous redemptive dimension built into his character and emerge
as enormously sympathetic. Christopher Plummer won several critics'
awards as Mike Wallace in ``The Insider.'' Well, why not? He's only
one of the world's best actors. Word is that Wallace was displeased
with the film. If so, he was led astray by his ego. If Christopher
Plummer plays you, you should probably just shut up and watch him.
You'll learn how to play yourself better. This is the most crowded
category, which means equally worthy work by Chris Cooper
(``October Sky,'' ``American Beauty''), Jude Law (``The Talented
Mr. Ripley''), and Tom Cruise (``Magnolia'') will be bypassed for
no good reason other than arithmetic. Or not. We'll see Tuesday.

CITY OF GOD 
By E.L. Doctorow. Random House. 272 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine, first, the Big Apple as the ultimate city of forbidden
fruit _ a post-Edenic metropolis of sin, temptation, and humanity
unbound, where The Fall might mean either a roller-coaster in
Queens or a particularly bad night in an alley on the East Side.
It's a place blessed with performance art on every corner and the
magnificence of culture on every other block; it's also an
anti-Mecca cursed with the colliding fears of millions of
strangers, where misery sleeps in the mud tracks left by the
stretch limos. Good morning, New York! Now whistle a little tune to
accompany our metaphor of infinite paradox: something with a little
swing, say, something that would work in the piano bars _ those
comfort dens of melancholy and smoke and excess insight. Because
that's the one common denominator about New York; it's all, God
help us, just too much.
</P>
<P>
   Holy hell, in other words, delivered, willy-nilly, in the
postmodern primordial soup that is ``City of God.'' With his
deliberately fractured narrative and his forays into sex, religion,
history, science, and popular culture, E. L. Doctorow has produced
a novel that seeks to be about everything. He has instead given us
something where the parts are greater than the whole _ a vast
territory marked by brilliant tributaries, but lacking a cohesive
center. ``City of God'' is both showy and exasperating, continually
demonstrating the intellectual fluency of its author but lacking
the aesthetic reach _ call it literary generosity _ that imbued
``Ragtime,'' ``World's Fair,'' and ``Billy Bathgate.'' With his
firebrand conscience and a brainpower available to few of his
peers, Doctorow has always used history to literary advantage; in
some cases, though, he has been used by it, and this is one of
them. ``City of God'' is imaginative without being creative, its
disparate themes containing the swirls and crescendos of great but
incomplete jazz riffs _ the last notes wandering off into the
night, leaving you dizzy and not a little lonely.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, that's New York, right? The usual argument for this
kind of prismatic approach to fiction, where several stories and
narrative detritus coexist without intersecting, is that the
fragmented work mirrors the culture it records _ where time and
space collide on a million computer screens, where linear narrative
itself belongs to the past. However intellectually tempting this
radical aesthetic may be, it almost always bears the risk of
blowing up the novel in order to save it.
</P>
<P>
   What Doctorow has managed are a couple of old-fashioned,
beautifully wrought stories lurking within his expressionistic
whole. ``City of God'' opens with a narrator awed and horrified by
the facts of modern science and theology: an infinitely expanding
universe; a world where evil and God no longer even bother to argue
with each other; the muck of human consciousness that may well have
invented the whole enchilada. Cut to a pickup scene at a New York
dinner party; cut to a renegade Episcopal priest named Thomas
Pemberton whose church has been vandalized. Eventually a thread
reveals itself: This is the workbook of a writer named Everett,
who, casting about for the plot of a novel, weaves together his
rough drafts, his meetings with the real people who will become his
characters, and various diatribes on subjects from birdwatching to
film criticism (with walk-ons by Wittgenstein and Einstein).
Everett is a kind of casual Pirandello, wandering on and off stage
but still in charge; he's also the ultimate secular antihero _ a
disaffected intellectual who wants to believe in something beyond
the dark legacies of history. No wonder he's drawn to Pemberton, or
Pem, whose struggles with faith and modern doctrine become the
novel's central story as well as its cri de coeur.
</P>
<P>
   The sacking of Pem's church leads the priest to a brownstone on
the Upper West Side, where two married progressive rabbis, Joshua
Gruen and Sarah Blumenthal, are launching the Synagogue of
Evolutionary Judaism out of their living room. The 8-foot brass
cross from St. Timothy's has somehow been deposited on the rabbis'
roof; is this a felonious mystery, or a religious one? So begins
the interweaving of sacred and profane that provides the link of
``City of God,'' where the idea of ``omniscient narrative,'' in
both the religious and literary sense, poses the greatest question.
Faced with the onslaught of evil and chaos _ of Hitler, Stalin, the
black holes of science as well as history _ how do we create moral
order in the world?
</P>
<P>
   That's the theoretical path to the central story of Doctorow's
novel, which is a recounting by Sarah's father, reimagined by
Everett, of the Jewish ghetto in Lithuania where he was a boy _
where he watched as his parents, and then his caretakers, were
hauled away or murdered, where he served as a runner for the
ghetto's council leaders, where he helped smuggle out the forbidden
journals that recorded both Nazi atrocities and the private
triumphs of daily Jewish life. This story is not only stunningly
relayed in Everett's (and Doctorow's) hands; it also possesses the
thematic attributes that the rest of the novel circles. With young
Yehoshua a witness to one of the worst moments in human history,
his capture and delivery of that story become a courageous act of
salvation. Passed into memory, then journal narrative, then
Everett's (and Doctorow's) reimagining, the mythicized account of
what was, in fact, the Kovno ghetto takes on a gravitas that can
outlive the evil done there.
</P>
<P>
   That somber task reappears in several complementary war
narratives in the novel: Everett's father surviving no man's land
in France; his older brother as a flier in the Second World War; an
anonymous Vietnam vet _ something of a wounded one-man Greek chorus
_ delivering his lamentation from a bar. There are a few passages
of recitation and revelation in ``City of God'' that are momentous;
one of the most haunting is a Nazi curator's inventory of the
property of the dead. But when these narrative experiments have
slighter subjects, they work against the power of the novel;
riveted upon the story of little Yehoshua Blumenthal, we are
wrenched into, say, a visit by Pem to his ex-wife, or Everett's
account of a day spent watching the nest of a white gyrfalcon. It
probably doesn't help that the brief biography we have of the
writer Everett so closely resembles that of the writer Doctorow.
This similarity, whether or not it's meant to be self-referential,
has the unfortunate consequence of making you wonder just whose
unfinished workbook we're reading.
</P>
<P>
   Doctorow has always been a sort of alchemist of narrative; at
his best, his appropriation of history results in a reification of
myth _ where fact, uplifted by fiction, ascends to a higher plane
of literary memory. But his own righteous brilliance has eclipsed
Doctorow the artist in ``City of God''; even Pem, that impassioned
ex-priest of the streets, winds up delivering a petition to God
that sounds more like Southern revivalism than lapsed Christianity.
``City of God'' seems to yearn, however haphazardly, to be a novel
of ideas. And one is left with the creak and whir of intellect,
rather than the pure light of vision.

&HT;     SMALL-TOWN CARE FROM A BIG-CITY GROCERY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The corner of Polk and Ellis in San Francisco, a
block from the X-rated O'Farrell Theater, is an unlikely place to
hear this sentence, but this is what Tom Nolan said: ``What we're
about is re-creating small-town America in a big city.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan is the executive director of Project Open Hand, which was
started 15 years ago by Ruth Brinker, whose idea was to provide
good food to San Franciscans sick at home with AIDS _ the way small
town residents take soup and casseroles to their sick neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This concept of covered-dish care and neighborliness grew to one
of the shining examples of San Francisco's response to AIDS,
inspiring similar volunteer meal-delivery programs in 95 other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Project Open Hand, with huge modern kitchens at Polk
and Ellis, began delivery of meals to people in San Francisco and
Alameda County who are incapacitated at home with any kind of
disease or injury, not just HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``For about 15 years, we've been telling people `You have the
wrong disease,''' said Open Hand's program director, Michael
Kossman. ``Now we don't have to say that, and that's an incredible
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, San Francisco and Oakland are not small
towns, and no one knows how many people are sick and homebound.
That's why I'm writing this.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in San Francisco or Alameda County, and you're stuck
at home because of illness or injury (and you're under 60, thus not
eligible for Meals on Wheels), give Project Open Hand a call at
1-800-551-MEAL.
</P>
<P>
   You can have nourishing meals delivered by someone who cares.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very special small town that Project Open Hand has at its
headquarters of three years at Polk and Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine Herr and Georgia Kirkpatrick have volunteered for Open
Hand for a decade. They were having lunch after their shift
packaging meals on a spiffy little production line.
</P>
<P>
   They're part of a regular Tuesday morning club of women
volunteers. ``We've become so close we get together on the
outside,'' Kirkpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In the staff dining area, nutritionist Carol Friedman was eating
tofu while Terry Young, who works in the grocery center, joshed her
about finding Cocoa Puffs to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery center is where people can order and pick up
groceries _ quality ones, from all the food groups, including a few
items from the snack food group. Why shouldn't the elderly and the
sick have American enjoyments? In the kitchen, cooks Benjamin
Rodriquez and Li Jin Quan were preparing thousands of orders of
broiled chicken with marengo sauce, flank steak, fried fish fillets
and steamed fresh vegetables. Daisy Becerra, the special orders
cook, was stirring a big enough pot of couscous to star in one of
those funny TV couscous ads.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the key thing for anyone who's ever worked in a
restaurant. The kitchen was sparkling clean, loaded with the best
equipment and filled with luscious smells and good-hearted
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good place.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;

HOME BUYERS IN THEIR SITES

<P>
   Online mortgage companies promise convenience, lower rates and
fees, and faster approvals, but typically they still require such
old-fashioned things as paper copies of W-2s and the borrower's
signature to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a loan to buy a home may not yet be a pure Internet
transaction. But thousands of people are starting applications
online, and billions of dollars worth of mortgages are originating
there, according to the latest quarterly survey by National
Mortgage News, an industry weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's convenient,'' said Paul Muolo, executive editor of the
weekly. ``But you've still got to schedule a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   The online competition is fierce, with Internet sites such as
these, to name a few:
</P>
<P>
   --www.countrywide.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.eloan.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.homeadvisor.msn.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.mortgage.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.nowlending.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.quickenmortgage.com
</P>
<P>
   Only an estimated 1 percent of the more than $1 trillion a year
mortgage market originates online, but some analysts project it
could grow to 10 or 15 percent, even 25 percent, by 2003, Muolo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Online mortgage companies expect business to really take off
once legislation allowing ``electronic signatures'' in Internet
transactions becomes law. Both houses of Congress have passed
versions of such a bill, but setting up a conference committee has
proved controversial, with sides being drawn over how to protect
the privacy of online customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites are already getting ready, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sites try to distinguish themselves with various features, such
as rent-versus-buy and mortgage calculators. Some sites even
promise a free PC or cash back in exchange for applying there. Some
are the sites of direct lenders, while others are run by mortgage
brokers. Some portal sites list a bunch of mortgage companies, with
rate comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with a visit to a local bank, borrowers need to look at
the fine print and compare fees and other differences, Muolo said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest pitches that Internet sites make is the speed
with which they approve applications, with promises of an online OK
within minutes or hours _ with little or no paperwork required.
</P>
<P>
   Muolo said that doesn't make much of a difference in most
people's home-purchasing plans, but officials from mortgage Web
sites disagree.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, nowlending.com, based in Wilmington, Mass. and a
subsidiary of Webster Bank in Connecticut, is running a print and
radio advertising campaign that plays off the tortoise and the hare
fable to promote what it calls a streamlined approval process.
</P>
<P>
   In two to 24 hours, online applicants ``find out if they've been
approved with conditions or they haven't,'' said Sean Marsh, senior
vice president of marketing for nowlending.com, which reported to
National Mortgage News that it originated $42 million in mortgages
online in the third quarter of 1999. An applicant approved with
conditions is told what supporting documents must be sent to close
the loan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan's senior vice president of technology integration,
Cameron King, said, ``We guarantee the actual approval within 24
hours.'' And if an applicant has a W-2 form or pay stub ready to
fax, ``We can provide that approval literally within an hour of
their being in the site.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan, which reported originating $330 million worth of
mortgages online in the third quarter of 1999, features what King
said is the only online tracking of the status of an application.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Countrywide Home Loans, a direct lender that
has more than 550 offices nationwide, said it, too, will soon
announce streamlined approvals. Applicants with the best credit
could be approved in minutes by just answering three questions and
allowing a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is prove who you are,'' the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide reported originating $1.2 billion worth of mortgages
online in the third quarter of 1999, according to National Mortgage
News, but E-Loan's King disputed that figure, saying his company's
method of keeping track is more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The Countrywide spokeswoman, who did not want to be named, said
that her company tracks the numbers the same way E-Loan does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with online lending is it's hard getting data,''
Muolo said.

FINANCIAL ADVISERS SEE ADVANTAGES IN USED CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When financial planner Jonathan Pond uses a shovel to scrape the
snow off his used 1986 Toyota, his neighbors watch in horror. His
12-year-old daughter eventually adjusted, but for a while was
mortified when he drove her to a friend's house or to school in his
old Cadillac. She asked to be dropped off a block away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People laugh at my cars. Who cares?'' said Pond, a
Boston-based, nationally known public television and radio
commentator and author of the new book ``Your Money Matters.'' He
credits his used-car buying habit with helping to build his
family's net worth to more than a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bradley, a retirement planning specialist and a member of
Vista Financial Group in Westborough, Mass., bought a used 1995
Plymouth Neon a year ago with $7,000 in cash rather than use it as
a down payment on a new $22,000 Buick Regal, after he did the math
and found he could have an extra $37,000 in five years by investing
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, says his used-car habits have helped put him ahead
financially, allowing his family to own a four-bedroom home with a
three-car garage and his children to go to private universities
such as Villanova and Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm turning 50 this year. I realize it's not the car you
drive,'' but other things, such as the ability to afford a nicer
house, pay for your children's college education, and save for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Pond and Bradley aren't the only financially savvy people who
say there are better ways to use your money than buying a new
expensive car or sport utility vehicle every few years, or leasing
something you can't afford to own. To name a few:
</P>
<P>
   --Andrew Tobias, author of ``The Only Investment Guide You'll
Ever Need,'' says he just bought a 1996 Saturn. His feeling: ``That
new car smell is the most expensive fragrance in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   --Paul Kangas, co-anchor of public television's ``Nightly
Business Report,'' says he buys cars new and keeps them as long as
they run, including the 1983 Caprice with 150,000 miles that he
drives to work. ``It may not look all that great. It's held up.''
He also owns a 1986 Lincoln with about 110,000 miles and just
bought a new Cadillac Deville for long trips.
</P>
<P>
   --Amy Domini, president of the Domini Social Equity fund, bought
a new Subaru wagon a few years ago _ the most expensive car she has
ever owned _ because of its fuel efficiency and good safety and
maintenance record and because ``I wanted something that I was
pretty sure would last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   --Lawrence Coolidge, senior trustee of Loring, Wolcott and
Coolidge, a Boston investment firm for which Domini also manages
money, just bought a new Volvo that he plans to keep at least 10
years. He had been driving a nine-year-old Taurus wagon and a
15-year-old Oldsmobile before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old cars produce cheap transportation,'' he said. ``I'd rather
give the money away to Jobs for Youth than buy a $50,000 Land
Rover,'' referring to a Boston nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   --Even car savvy brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi of public
radio's ``Car Talk,'' and John Paul, the ``car doctor'' for the
American Automobile Association Southern New England, own old or
used cars.
</P>
<P>
   But despite what these folks say _ which is echoed in such books
as ``The Millionaire Next Door'' and ``Getting Rich in America'' _
there are plenty of people who love that new-car smell and are
willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's one thing to save money, but the purchase of a
car is still an emotionally charged decision for most people,''
said Daniel Quirk, owner of Quirk auto dealerships south of Boston
that sell and lease new Nissans, Volkswagens, Fords, Chevrolets,
Mazdas, and Mitsubishis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People view their car as an extension of their personality,''
he added. ``Part of being an American is to have a little bit of
gasoline in your veins.''
</P>
<P>
   The roaring economy is sending a lot of gasoline coursing
through those veins these days. Sales of new passenger vehicles,
particularly sport utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup trucks,
are breaking records. Members of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, which represents more than 19,500 new car and truck
franchises, are optimistic that 2000 will be a big year, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to the dealers association, Massachusetts has a big
appetite: It outpaced the region and the country in new-vehicle
registrations of so-called light trucks _ which include SUVs and
minivans. Between 1998 and 1999, new registrations of light trucks
increased by 10 percent nationally, 12.6 percent in New England,
and 15.1 percent in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, loans to pay for the new cars and trucks also have
reached record levels, with $451 billion outstanding as of the end
of 1998, representing about one-third of all short- and medium-term
consumer installment credit, according to the latest data
available. And Presidents' Day next weekend, traditionally a
new-car buying time, will probably rev up those sales and loan
figures even more.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for new cars, auto dealers point to safety
features, such as side airbags.
</P>
<P>
   ``What price are you going to put on safety?'' said George
Albrecht, president of several auto dealerships and who is on the
board of the Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want my wife or my daughter or my sisters to be in a
newer car than in an older car,'' he said, emphasizing that in the
former they are less likely to have to worry about the battery when
it's zero degrees, or the tires when it's snowing.
</P>
<P>
   And, for those concerned about finances, Thomas Keery, president
of Frost Motors Inc., points to a less expensive way of enjoying
the new-car feel, through manufacturer-subsidized lease programs
that result in lower monthly payments than if a person borrowed to
buy the new car.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with financing the purchase of a new car, leasing ``is
actually going to be your `lowest cost to drive,' '' said Keery,
using a term that describes a monthly figure based on maintenance
and finance costs over three or four years. ``That's what we've
found to be the lowest amount when we put pencil to paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers don't add up for Bradley or Pond.
</P>
<P>
   While people making money in the good times ``have a right to
put it anywhere they want,'' whether it be buying a new SUV or
leasing a Cadillac, Bradley said, those who are frugal now will
weather the next recession better, and may be able to retire
earlier or buy a bigger house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate cars,'' said Pond, the man with 180,000 miles on his
Toyota and 120,000 on his Cadillac. ``I hate them because of what
they do to people. They're dragging a lot of people down. People
are not making the kind of progress they should be making in their
financial lives.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his point, Pond did a study a few years ago, using
statistics from the American Automobile Association, a 7.5 percent
annual return on investment, and a 3.5 percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Over a 40-year working career, a person who buys a new car and
keeps it for 10 years can come out financially ahead of someone who
trades in for a new car every three years. According to the study,
if that person takes the savings in new-car payments and insurance
and invests it, allowing the money to compound over the decades,
the total would be about $385,000 _ enough to help fund an early
retirement.

BREEDING _ BETWEEN THE LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Lonely SF, 30s, sensitive, fun, music and animal lover, looking
for someone to love. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   A modest little ad in the Boston Globe personals, tucked among
many that promise so much. ``Attractive.'' ``Dynamic.'''
``Gorgeous.'' ``Great figure.'' ``Awesome.'' ``Striking.'' Even
``articulate.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope Lonely SF finds someone to love, or at least a likely
candidate, someone tall, with manly features and the right sort of
pheromones. Because that is what love is all about. Forget romance.
When it comes to sexual attraction, it seems we are at the mercy of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   A story in a recent U.S. News and World Report collected some
recent findings about the biology of love between the sexes. Men
and women follow codes of attraction and beauty that may be
millions of years old, codes that have evolved to help us find the
healthiest mate and thus give us the best chance to pass our genes
to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   We may not be conscious of evolution when we're trolling for a
significant other, but it has us in its grip, even if we think we
have no intention of reproducing.
</P>
<P>
   Women are drawn to the visible signs that a man is brimming with
testosterone. Height. Craggy chin and brow. Muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Men look for signs that a woman is fertile. A youthful face with
widely spaced eyes and a small chin. A high waist-to-hip ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have also found that men and women are attracted to
potential mates whose faces and bodies are symmetrical, a sign of a
strong constitution. They also prefer those whose scents are most
unlike their own, an indication that their genes are dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   Are the great love stories no more than a matter of evolutionary
biology? ``O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? / Deny thy
father and refuse they name / Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my
love / Because we do not smell the same.''
</P>
<P>
   And love at first sight? The love that makes sense at all, that
leaves you eager to make an abject fool of yourself for no apparent
reason? Blame it on his chin.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's New York Times Magazine, Alain de Botton writes
amusingly about ``The Schopenhauer Method,'' the 19th-century
German philosopher's ``answers to love in three easy steps.''
</P>
<P>
   According to de Botton, Schopenhauer anticipated just about
everything modern science is now discovering about the biology of
love. He theorized that the unconscious self is governed by ``the
will to life,'' i.e., to reproduce, and that the conscious self,
the intellect, ``understands only so much as is necessary to
promote reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schopenhauer also understood that the unconscious self is
attracted to those who will increase the chances of producing
beautiful and intelligent offspring. And de Botton summarizes the
great pessimist's analysis of love and the urge to procreate: ``The
pursuit of personal happiness and the production of healthy
children are two radically contrasting projects, which love
maliciously confuses us into thinking of as one in the same for a
requisite number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schopenhauer wrote that this explains ``why we often see very
rational, and even eminent, men tied to termagants and matrimonial
fiends, and cannot conceive of how they could have made such a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   And, needless to add, it explains why we see so many nice women
mixed up with impossible men.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Lonely SF should consider rewriting her ad to include
something about her symmetrical features and good hip-to-waist
ratio. Or maybe not. I hope she finds someone to love and doesn't
have to learn the hard way that there's something worse than being
lonely alone: being lonely with someone you once loved.

`PEANUTS' CARTOONIST A GENTLE MESSENGER TO THE END 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Good ol' Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Like Charlie Brown, the moon-faced and ill-fated cartoon
character he created half a century ago, Charles Monroe Schulz
persevered. When he died of a heart attack in his sleep on Saturday
night at the age of 77, it was just hours before Charlie and the
rest of the ``Peanuts'' crowd made their final original appearance
in print. It was as if Mr. Schulz, who was suffering from colon
cancer and had announced the retirement of both the comic strip and
himself in December, was waiting for Charlie, Linus, Schroeder, Pig
Pen, and Snoopy to depart so he could go with them.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when pop icons change with the click of a remote
control or a mouse, Mr. Schulz and ``Peanuts'' endured. One of the
major blessings of the strip _ the most widely read in history _
was that it didn't change to fit the times. Charlie Brown always
reacted to his misfortunes with a low-key ``Good grief!'' (Can you
imagine him saying ``Bummer?'' Please.) Lucy was seldom nice, even
when she was charging a nickel for advice. (Can you imagine her fee
being affected by inflation? Not likely.) Snoopy never upgraded his
aircraft from World War I vintage to supersonic jet. (Can you
imagine him traveling at the speed of sound? Not at all.)
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, no one could ever imagine Lucy actually leaving
the football on the ground and letting poor, hapless Charlie Brown
kick it. Not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schulz's contract reportedly ensures that no one else will
draw ``Peanuts.'' Good thing. He was, by all accounts, a true
gentleman who was able to imbue his characters with gentle souls
despite their anxiety, angst, and frustration. ``AACK! I can't
stand it!'' Charlie Brown would gripe, but it wasn't his style to
haul off and slug someone. Maybe that's why we haven't seen a
``Peanuts'' video game.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained early in Mr. Schulz's career that his
artistic style was too primitive, and he subsequently altered it
somewhat. Later he was chastised for the simplicity of ``Peanuts''
itself, something he didn't change. Good for him. After all, he
wove together a tapestry of psychology, philosophy, and theology
that was as rich as anything the comics field has ever seen.
Anybody who thought that ``Peanuts'' was about a boy falling down
while trying to kick a football was missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schulz arrived on the scene at a time when superheroes were
the comic rage, and he created a bunch of pre-adolescent
anti-heroes. But although ``Peanuts'' was supposedly about a gaggle
of kids, we knew better than that, even though there were no adults
in the strip. We knew that ``Peanuts'' was also about us grown-ups
who grew up after World War II and spent an inordinate amount of
time fretting about our insecurities. (Mr. Schulz may not have
invented the term ``security blanket,'' but he certainly
popularized it.) Like us, Charlie Brown struggled mightly just to
get through the day. He was Everyman, not Everyboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create humor out of happiness,'' Mr. Schulz once
wrote, adding: ``I'm astonished at the number of people who write
to me saying, `Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does
Charlie Brown always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the
football?' Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets
to kick the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mr. Schulz was no pessimist. Charlie Brown may have
struggled, but he never gave up. He was truly an American hero _ or
at least the kind of hero Americans admire _ repeatedly pulling
himself off the canvas after getting whacked around by the pitfalls
of life. ``You've just got to let things go along, ride them out,
and see how they turn out in the end,'' Mr. Schulz explained once.
``There's no use trying to solve all your problems in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schulz often compared himself to Charlie Brown, describing
himself as someone who tries to do the right thing but for whom
things often go wrong. And although his biographer, Rheta Grimsley
Johnson, wrote that he grappled with depression and anxiety, he was
an indefatigably decent person whose kindness and modesty were
unaltered by his success and the millions of dollars it fetched.
The cartoonist was known as ``Sparky,'' treated his fans with
outmost respect, and took only one vacation in his professional
life.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, Jeannie, and five children from
his first marriage. A private funeral is scheduled for this week.
</P>
<P>
   There's always been a tendency to do Mr. Schulz by the numbers:
2,600 newspapers in 76 countries, more than 1,400 books, some 40
animated television specials, 355 million readers. But that's not
the point.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schulz created a comic strip that did what it was
supposed to do: It was funny. Alas, that's not as common as it
sounds, and Mr. Schulz knew it. In an interview about five years
ago, he lamented the ``rollicking sense of humor that we don't
have'' in our comics and other media.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he had it, and so did the entire ``Peanuts'' crew. We
thought Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz would go on forever, and
now we've lost both in the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief is right.

BUSH CAMPAIGN GETS NASTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; GAFFNEY, S.C. -- ``It took a while, but we think we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   This coldly rational Bush campaign assessment of its assault on
John McCain before he acquires the national momentum that could
sweep the Republican establishment aside makes two-dimensional
sense. It's the third dimension, in this case a possible explosion
in voting in next weekend's South Carolina primary, that George W.
Bush still has to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain likes to picture himself as Luke Skywalker trying to
escape the Death Star, the Bush campaign against him is starting to
feel like ``The Empire Strikes Back.'' It is not pretty and is
rarely factual, but under the South Carolina Republican Party's
wing _ symbolized by those who learned attack politics from the
late Lee Atwater _ Bush is drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Bush managed to draw McCain into his
face-scratching game. The effect was to knock McCain off his higher
ground and make the campaign look nasty, not the kind of primary
that younger voters, first-time voters, independent-minded voters,
and even Democratic voters (the people who could produce a McCain
victory) are likely to view as worth participating in.
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what the Bush operatives have in mind. For
hard-core Republicans, Bush is the real conservative and McCain is
not. But for people outside that inner core, Bush strategists
explain that they are trying to raise doubts about McCain's
character and dirty up the campaign enough to diminish enthusiasm
about voting. Translation: small, typical South Carolina turnout on
Feb. 19 and Bush wins; anything like the New Hampshire experience
and he's toast.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, the visible part of the effort was on display
in this upper corner of the South Carolina, the primary's
battleground area. The Bushies, with a free barbecue supper, had
lured more than a thousand to the National Guard armory. They were
polite but anything but wild _ a typical Bush audience. The new act
has three key parts:
</P>
<P>
   --Bush is really McCain. It's an old political trick: become
some key element of your opponent to blunt his appeal. So Bush is
now a reformer who gets results. His months-old speech now refers
to ``my reform agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   --McCain is the real ``insider.'' For this part of the act, the
new symbol is the repeated reference to his opponent as ``Chairman
McCain,'' replacing John with the senator's Commerce Committee
honorific. On issue after issue, Chairman McCain is linked with
Bill Bradley and Al Gore, as in campaign finance reform, where Bush
asserts with audacious mendacity that the ``big difference'' is
their identification with ``labor union bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   --Taxes, taxes, and more taxes. Again, Chairman McCain and Gore
are linked in a conspiracy to prevent people's money, in the form
of budget surpluses, from being returned to them.
</P>
<P>
   This public face, however, is more than matched on television
with a relentless barrage of commercials painting McCain as a
hypocritical influence peddler and closet Democrat on taxes. Well
into this weekend, the Bush ads were outrunning the McCain
commercials by at least 3-to-1, and this is the stuff McCain
responded to (probably unwisely) with 30-second suggestions that
Bush has Bill Clinton's regard for truth. The word is the Bush ads
will get even rougher this week, built around the claim that McCain
is a failed legislator.
</P>
<P>
   By traditional yardsticks _ above all, the historical fact of
light voting on primary day, a Saturday _ the Bush campaign's
return to smug satisfaction makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, and yet. McCain's ability to pierce conventional
thinking remains uncanny. My favorite example occurred 50 miles
down the road in Greenville, once the center of textile and
furniture-making South Carolina but now a New South dynamo built
around such investments as a sprawling BMW plant between it and
nearby Spartanburg. The economic explosion has spawned new luxury
housing subdivisions populated by new residents, many from outside
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville's mayor, Knox White, is an archetypical New South
Republican and proud leader of a sophisticated community that has
Japanese and Italian restaurants on its main street. White has
taken the plunge for McCain, very much against the upcountry grain.
Just to be on the safe side, McCain also has Representative J.D.
Hayworth along for the day's Straight Talk Express ride. A blowhard
right-winger from Arizona, Hayworth prepared for Congress in local
TV news, including a breakthrough stint on a Greenville station.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the crowds at his town meetings (he continues to
average three a day despite a cold, in contrast to Bush's lazy
pace) are bigger than they were in New Hampshire and just as
enthusiastic as he and they converse at length. His best moment
came in Spartanburg, when a mother got up in tears to complain
about a call to her son from a polling firm connected to the Bush
campaign that passed along negative information about McCain's
record in the guise of asking for his voting preference.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called ``push polling'' creates a sinister impression of
campaigning. The point of the incident, however, is not what it
says about Bush but how it dramatizes McCain's potential if he can
keep to the high ground with his message of conservative reform.
</P>
<P>
   As in New Hampshire, the head wants to say Bush while the eyes
and gut say McCain. With a big debate and a week of campaigning to
go, the next several days are going to seem like an eternity.

HE DIDN'T EVEN GET POT ROAST

<P>
   Douglas Tyrrell is no naif. For 25 years he has worked as a
motion clerk at the Suffolk County Courthouse, a Boston venue
decidedly short on wide-eyed innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced nine years ago, he has seen enough of love and loss at
age 45 to proceed with caution in matters of the heart. But who
among us has never been too blind to see that what seems too good
to be true probably is?
</P>
<P>
   Tyrrell offers a cautionary tale from the brave new world of
cyber-dating. ``I got suckered good,'' he says, as candid as he is
chastened about the downside of looking for love on line.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown weary of the bar scene and skeptical of personal
ads that promise ``everyone is slim and attractive until you met
them,'' he says he turned to the Internet, where online dating
services and Web sites with names like Match.Com are attracting
millions of cyber-visitors.
</P>
<P>
   From his apartment, Doug began surfing the Internet and
corresponding with dozens of women in chat rooms. He dated several,
but no one clicked quite like Jennifer from Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Doug ``met'' Jennifer just before Christmas on a Web site
designed for singles in their 40s. They exchanged e-mail about
sports, about work, about the difficulty of dating in midlife. Soon
enough, they exchanged telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer would call Doug before he left for work at the
courthouse. At night, they would watch ``Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire'' in apartments separated by half a continent but
tethered by the Web. They talked so often by telephone that
Jennifer sent Doug a prepaid phone card out of deference to his
civil servant's salary.
</P>
<P>
   She could afford it, she told him; she owned her own company and
a luxury apartment overlooking Lake Michigan. Why had a woman as
successful as she never married? She was engaged once, Jennifer
told him tearfully, but her fiance had been killed in a motorcycle
accident.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Jennifer asked Doug to come visit. She would book
his flight. She knew the airline schedules because she traveled so
much herself, on business. She would be happy to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Doug drove through a snowstorm to Logan Airport a few weeks ago
to pick up his ticket and board a flight to Milwaukee. The ticket
wasn't there. That was easy enough to explain, Jennifer said when
Doug called her at work. She was so busy, she'd neglected to make
the reservation. He should just buy a ticket at the counter and
plan to arrive in time for dinner; she was making pot roast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pot roast,'' says Doug, sounding most aghast at the specifity
of the deceit. ``She told me she was making pot roast. Who would
lie about a pot roast?''
</P>
<P>
   Doug flew to Milwaukee, his head stuffed with visions of romance
and homecooked pot roast. Jennifer was not at the airport. She had
gotten tied up at work, she said when he called. Give her a few
minutes. She'd be right there. He gave her 30 minutes, then 60.
``Just go home,'' she said when he called again. ``This was a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   How could he ``just go home?'' It would be embarrassing enough
to face his friends at work without being able to explain what had
happened with the woman who sent him the potted plant he kept
carefully watered on his courthouse desk.
</P>
<P>
   He took a taxi to the address Jennifer had described as a
lakeshore high-rise. What he found, instead, was a rundown
two-family bungalow in a neighborhood not distinguished by its
scenic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no Jennifer lives here,'' said the woman who answered the
front door. ``No, I'm not Jennifer,'' his cyber-date confessed when
Doug called her a final time at work. ``My real name is Jill and I
always answer the phone because I'm the receptionist here.'' She
was sorry, she said; she hadn't meant for it to go so far. She
would repay him.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrrell returned to Boston, knowing he would never see
Jennifer/Jill or his money. Cyber-dating and personal ads turned
out to have more in common than he had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be anyone they want on line,'' says Doug, who is more
skeptical now about the claims of his correspondents, more careful
to move slowly, but no less optimistic about the chance of finding
love on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got burned, but you have to take a chance. If you don't
you'll never know,'' he says. One thing Doug Tyrrell knows is that
when he finds true love, on or off the Web, he'll find it locally.
``No more road trips for me,'' he says. ``If I can't drive to her,
she's not the one.''

SURGING MCCAIN MAY YET SUFFER THE MEDIA'S SLINGS AND ARROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever a presidential hopeful were to get a free ride from the
media, that candidate may be John McCain. But if there is also such
a thing as the media hitching a ride with a candidate, this year's
group may well qualify.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just members of the media who have cast their fate
with the Republican senator from Arizona. Perhaps not since Ronald
Reagan made his 1980 bid for the presidency has a candidate
received so much support from so many different groups. McCain has
won the backing of the young and the elderly; antiwar activists and
staunch veterans; Democrats, independents and Republicans; and
anti-establishment voters as well as those squarely in the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Since his big upset victory in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire
presidential primary over Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had
been the all-but-anointed GOP nominee, McCain has been riding the
crest of a huge political wave _ one that could swamp Bush's bid
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite winning in New Hampshire, coming in second in
Delaware without even campaigning, and pulling even with Bush in
the polls in South Carolina, McCain knows that it is still a long
way to the Republican convention and the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The positive coverage is due partly to McCain's personable,
candid approach to the electorate. It is due, too, to Bush's
inability to connect with Republican and independent voters, many
of whom have come to think of him as less than presidential, given
his often rambling performance in debates and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's attacks on McCain are having an effect in South
Carolina, where McCain has now fallen behind in the polls with the
election looming Saturday. If McCain loses there, his strategy, and
his viability, would be in question. He could come under the same
media scrutiny that Bush endured before and has since his New
Hampshire loss.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference, of course, is that McCain is so much more
appealing to voters than his Texas rival. Many registered Democrats
have _ or have said they will _ cross party lines, for example, to
vote for him in the March 7 Massachusetts primary. But if McCain
falters in South Carolina, it costs him precious momentum. It
doesn't take much to stumble and fall behind.
</P>
<P>
   As an ex-POW, McCain is a genuine war hero to much of the
electorate; some voters believe that his ability to survive a
prisoner of war camp and become a successful senator is almost
reason enough to vote him into the White House. And his popular
fight for campaign finance reform is resonating with voters. But
that issue could end up hurting him as much as it is currently
helping.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush has shown, McCain is vulnerable to contradictions on
that issue largely because he is receiving millions of dollars from
wealthy contributors who personify the need for the change in the
contribution rules. When Bush began attacking McCain on this issue,
McCain's ``negatives'' started going up, and Bush began to pull
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if Bush's more aggressive attacks appear to be
working, he can also remind voters how close McCain was to the
savings and loan scandal. When people talked about the ``Keating
Five,'' they were referring to the five US senators who associated
with the soiled banker, McCain being one of the five who basically
ended up with congressional slaps on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits believe that the Gulf War took the focus off the
scandal, and thus off McCain's involvement. Television networks
called on him for commentary on the military operations in the
gulf, which enhanced his image and reminded people of his war
record.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the network cameras on McCain may not be as friendly,
especially if his campaign starts a downward spiral after South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, McCain could also find himself between a rock and a
hard place on some issues. The Bush camp, for example, has been
suggesting to voters that McCain, while accusing Bush of being more
``like Clinton,'' is actually more of a Democrat himself. That, of
course, is aimed at preventing conservative Republicans from moving
to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that McCain's voting record in Congress has
shown him to be strongly anti-labor, and allied with conservative
Republicans on key issues. So McCain may be projecting a confusing
image that both Democrats and conservative Republicans are likely
to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Reagan's charisma was so successful _ and McCain's
may not be _ is that the party establishment, especially the
wealthy, wanted Reagan. Today, they want Bush. And McCain knows he
is going to need all the money he can get to outdo Bush, even if he
wins South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, McCain is working hard to be whatever he needs to be
to win the nomination. But as he passes through South Carolina and
other primaries coming up, voters will finally know who he is, and
where he stands.

AUSTRIANS, RIGHT AND LEFT, ASSAIL EU MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ The worldwide condemnation of Austria's far-right
government is provoking a backlash among Austrians themselves, many
of them far removed from Joerg Haider and his anti-immigrant
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even the European Union, which for the first time injected
itself last week into the internal politics of a member country by
denouncing Austria, has divisions among its nations over the degree
of distance it should keep from Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Each country's response has been shaped by its own history, the
ideological bent of its current government, and the potential
strength of far-right movements within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort of Austrians was evident one morning in the Cafe
Sperl, where a young Adolf Hitler used to spout racist views.
Sipping coffee, Viktor Eder was quick to say he was no racist and
did not vote for Haider's far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Eder, a 42-year-old financial manager, voiced deep
resentment of the European Union's decision to slap punitive
sanctions on Austria after the Freedom Party became a junior
partner early this month in a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who,'' Eder asked indignantly, ``are the Belgians and the
French to lecture us?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the French and Belgian governments, however, that
have expressed concern at the rise of Haider, particularly for his
rhetoric and his sympathetic remarks about Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Many leaders in the 15-member European Union have denounced not
only Haider but the conservative chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel,
who agreed to form a coalition with the far right after he was
unable to reach an accommodation with the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel's People's Party and the Social Democrats had ruled
Austria in coalition for most of the past half-century, a time when
Austria became stable and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   But as the EU wades into uncharted waters, the French and German
governments, which have traditionally been the engine driving
European integration, and which both keep a watchful eye on
far-right parties in their midst, have been the most outspoken in
their condemnation of the Freedom Party's rise. The Danish and
Swedish governments were muted, and mainstream conservatives across
Europe were skeptical of the EU's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Even liberals, such as Patricia McKenna, leader of Ireland's
environmental Green Party and a member of the European Parliament,
questioned the wisdom of ganging up on Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just wonder: Is this actually feeding the flames of
xenophobia?'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in Austria have found that the majority of Austrians, more
than double the 27 percent who had voted for the Freedom Party,
opposed the EU's involvement in what they saw as Austria's domestic
affairs. The support for Haider's party rose as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is shaping up as a major test for the very concept
of the European Union, which has molded itself into a federation of
states that have gradually surrendered some of their sovereignty to
create a political and economic bloc to rival the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Turning that theory into reality is proving to as difficult as
skeptics had predicted. Only 11 of the EU's 15 members have decided
to sign up for the single currency that was launched last year. And
as the Austrian affair has proved, putting forth a united front on
foreign policy, even within its own borders, could be far more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the European Union's response to Austria say it was
exaggerated and counterproductive, serving only to bolster Haider's
popularity at home. Like Viktor Eder, many Austrians who did not
vote for his party have been loudly resentful of other countries
meddling in their affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance that eventually became the European Union was
founded after World War II, mainly with the aim of preventing a
repeat of the two wars that destroyed much of Europe in the first
half of the 20th century. The alliance's founding fathers, such as
Jean Monnet of France, were determined to stop the spread of
fascism, and adopted the mantra of Holocaust survivors: ``Never
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who defend the European Union's response say the EU has a
moral duty to express opposition and to apply sanctions when the
governments of any of its member nations express views that are
widely seen as anathema to the reasons the EU was founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of principles and values,'' said the
Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, whose country holds
the rotating European Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany dismissed suggestions
that by publicly registering their disgust with Haider and his
party's policies, European leaders were interfering in Austria's
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an expression that we stand for a Europe based on values
and that Mr. Haider has constantly violated those values,''
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the quiet coffee shop of the Jewish Museum, Georg
Haber, a leader of Vienna's Jewish community, applauded the EU
reaction, even while acknowledging that it had given a boost to
Haider in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a signal, it is important,'' Haber said. ``It says you
can't do whatever you want and hide behind the claim of
sovereignty. I hope it will keep the government here on its toes,
and make it conform to the standards of democracy and human rights.
The EU's intervention has helped Haider in the short term, but I
think in the long run the EU has put us on notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Austrians acknowledge that they have not done enough to
confront their country's complicity with the Nazis during the Third
Reich. Even Haider, in an interview with the Globe, admitted as
much.
</P>
<P>
   But many Austrians also point out that 73 percent of voters did
not vote for the Freedom Party, and that they have a point when
they argue that their country has been singled out for sanctions.
They say the Freedom Party should be given a chance to prove that
it will adhere to the rules of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Party, successors to Mussolini's fascists, joined
an Italian coalition government in 1994 without EU objections, and
its members are now accepted as genuine democrats. Part of the
Spanish government today hails from a party founded by one of
Franco's totalitarian lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   The French government includes communists who have been accused
of ignoring or excusing the crimes of Stalin. And the EU has been
the biggest cheerleader of the Northern Ireland peace process, in
which former IRA commanders like Martin McGuinness have joined the
local government and, in McGuinness's case, have become government
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives like Schuessel argue that it is better to tame the
far right by holding it up to the scrutiny of democracy than to
allow it to snarl on the sidelines of opposition, pandering to
voters' pet peeves without enduring the liabilities of trying to
respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   Most French would seem to think otherwise. When five
conservative regional presidents won office in 1998 by entering
into pacts with the rightist National Front, they were thrown out
of their party.
</P>
<P>
   The EU's willingness to suppress the normal weight of
majorities, giving small nations like Ireland a disproportionate
level of power in EU decision-making compared with big nations like
Germany, will also force the EU to tread lightly with Austria if it
wants to enlarge.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Haider sees the attacks by the EU as unfair and
politically motivated. In an interview, he said the EU's response
was orchestrated by the liberal Social Democrats, whom his party
threw out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was initially reluctant to embrace the sanctions against
Austria. But now Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is saying that the
EU's aggressive intervention forced Haider and Schuessel to agree,
at President Thomas Klestil's insistence, to sign a pledge in which
they acknowledged Austria's complicity in the Third Reich and
committed the country to upholding human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cease our fight against xenophobia and racism, then we
put at risk the union that has actually given Europe 50 years of
peace,'' Cook said.

ON THE WEB, MAGAZINE IS ALL THE BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Buzz snakes through our culture like millennial mist. People and
institutions rise and fall on their ability to generate the stuff.
For more than a decade, Tina Brown was the fin de siecle queen of
buzz. As editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she and her
publications dominated table talk at All The Right Places.
</P>
<P>
   But today Brown is in eclipse. The latest pretender to her
throne is David Talbot, creator of Salon.com, the randy, San
Francisco-based online magazine. Talbot's house of buzz has cooked
up a daily gumbo of news and opinion, arguably hotter than anything
on the Internet. Anchored by outstanding cultural coverage, it
presents a sexed, edgy confection that attracts readers like moths
to a back porch light.
</P>
<P>
   And it has done so in cyberspace, not on the newsstand. ``Salon
is the first really successful new media site on the Net,'' says
media critic Jon Katz. ``It is the first to figure out how to fuse
content and interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Its craving for attention is matched by its penchant for
controversy. Salon is in the news for its lapses in judgment as
well as its scoops. Its writing, says Washington Post media critic
Howard Kurtz, ranges from superb to sophomoric. The editorial
product can be as uneven as it is insouciant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this unhinged approach has legs is unclear. ``Salon's
strength and weakness is that it takes all kinds of editorial
chances in an age when most publications are cautious and overly
polite,'' Kurtz says.
</P>
<P>
   When Salon is good, it is very good. Salon reporter Daniel
Forbes made headlines last month when he uncorked a story
documenting the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy's searching of network television scripts for antidrug
messages. It was a superior piece of journalism and a clean score
for Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Talbot ran a piece by Dan Savage, an
openly gay Seattle-based writer bent on giving then-presidential
candidate Gary Bauer the flu because of Bauer's antipathy toward
gays. Savage, who had come down with the virus, posed as a Bauer
volunteer in Iowa and fraudulently voted as a Republican there.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers howled about the piece, which they considered
beyond the pale even for Salon. Talbot printed a sampling of their
e-mail tirades along with an editor's note in which he stood by the
article without condoning what Savage claimed to have done. Today,
Talbot remains unchastened by l'affaire Savage: ``My only
difficulty was not to have put an editor's note on the piece when
it ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon, then, is the gifted adolescent who dazzles a crowd yet
forgets to clean up his room. And it couldn't care less about
criticism. ``There is no bad buzz,'' says David Weir, its
Washington bureau chief, updating P.T. Barnum's famous dictum.
``We're not The New York Times. We're not gatekeepers of what
should be published.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Salon's sense of propriety is elastic, its
pursuit of cheek singleminded. ``The primary reason Salon exists is
because of the frustration I felt by the confines of daily
journalism,'' explains Talbot, a former arts editor of the San
Francisco Examiner. ``It has become increasingly formulaic and
focus-group driven _ simply dull. I came of age with the gonzo
journalism of Hunter Thompson in Rolling Stone. It was risk-taking,
provocative journalism. We've done that here.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about that. Salon is still recovering from the
firestorm it created in 1998 over the story it ran, on the eve of
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, about a
34-year-old extramarital affair of House Judiciary Committee
chairman Henry Hyde. All 57 journalistic organizations that were
offered the story turned it down. Salon's Washington correspondent,
Jonathan Broder, left over Talbot's decision to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot was pilloried for leaky ethics and a pro-Clinton agenda.
There were bomb threats at the office and death threats at home. He
wrote at the time that ``ugly times call for ugly tactics'' and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is also a feast of guilty pleasures. It produces stories
as illicit in this earnest world as Godiva chocolates to a weight
watcher. High in this category are the 53 episodes of ``Nancy Chan:
Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl.'' This fictional romp catches with
a gimlet eye the lust in the Imperial City with chapters like
``Thighs Wide Shut.'' Salon also has a regular sex column. One
recent offering by Susie Bright titled ``The Randy Bellboy''
provided tips on how lonely female hotel guests can get serviced by
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbot also craves serious credentials. Salon's political
reportage, notably its award-winning work on the Whitewater
scandal, has been solid. Last summer, Weir opened a Washington
bureau that will soon have nine reporters. (There are 56 on the
editorial staff, 10 in New York and the rest in San Francisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Jake Tapper, its lead political reporter, provides a steady
stream of smart, wry coverage of the presidential campaign. The day
after the New Hampshire primary, while the rest of the media herd
focused on South Carolina, Anthony York had a strong piece
detailing how the arcane rules in the California primaries will
hinder the transfer of raw votes among independents for John McCain
and Bill Bradley into convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, sex trumps politics at Salon.
Grown-up discussion of it is Salon's long suit and is marbled
through the 11 Salon sites, which include Arts &AMP; Entertainment,
Books, Health &AMP; Body, Media, News, Politics2000, and, Technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest is Mothers Who Think, edited by Talbot's
wife, Camille Peri, devoted to intelligent exploration of real life
for women with children. Two weeks ago, it ran a piece asking, ``Is
this child pornography?'' about the trend among photo labs to call
police over film of naked children in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot celebrates sex because no one else does. He considers it
an effective tool to distance Salon from online competitors. ``The
question for new media operations is: What do you do that no one
else does?'' he asks. ``Most publications in America can't answer
that effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But more fundamentally, Talbot chafes at the way sex is treated
in this country. ``The US is childish as a culture in dealing with
it,'' says Talbot, who wrote a book on the subject. ``It is treated
either in a snickering sophomoric way or a harrumphing prudish way.
I find that inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Weir, ``I can't think of a dinner party when sex doesn't
come up along with politics, books, and movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot started Salon in 1995 as a weekly cultural digest. Books
were its windows to the world. ``At the beginning, we concluded
that the focus on new ideas in arts and culture and politics tended
to emerge through books,'' Weir says. Salon's book section remains
a superior admixture of knowing reviews covering an eclectic range
of books and illuminating interviews with authors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Talbot realized that Salon could not survive as a
weekly given the speed of the Internet, and in February 1997 took
it daily. ``We realized that news drives traffic,'' Weir says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, news coverage mushroomed, driven by the elections
that year and seismic events like the death of Princess Diana that
drew huge spikes in readership. Talbot sees running room covering
the entertainment industry. Because publications like Entertainment
Weekly are owned by conglomerates, he argues, they will be less
likely to pursue aggressive investigations than the independent
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Salon had revenues of $6.2 million last year and expects to turn
a profit sometime next year. It raised $27 million in a public
offering and $15 million from private investors last year to pay
for its current hiring spree. But profits are elusive for dotcoms.
Buzz does not automatically morph into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot hopes to open a European operation based in London later
this year. CEO Michael O'Donnell is now in Europe talking to
institutional investors. He salivates over the $800 million worth
of online ads in the United Kingdom alone last year and remains
sanguine that an American operation can thrive in a cultural
collision with the Euros.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Salon sold 10 percent of itself last year
to Rainbow Media Holdings, the holding company for the Bravo
Network, the Independent Film Channel, and American Movie Classics.
It plans to air its own television show on Bravo in late summer.
Salon Radio, accessible on its home page, is also ramping up its
audio stream of talk and music to augment the online offerings. By
the end of the year, a reader will be able to hear Salon reporters,
reviewers, and columnists read their work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salon readership is soaring, according to its own
figures. It claims that 3.4 million people visited it in December,
up fivefold from the 650,000 during the previous December. Slate,
the more traditional online magazine of politics and commentary run
by former New Republic editor Michael Kinsley, disputes the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This food fight is based on dueling statistics. The industry
yardstick has been Media Metrix, the New York company that projects
totals based on a sample of users. By that measurement, Salon had
1.4 million in December; Slate had 900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salon says that the sample system grossly underestimates the
true numbers. As for Slate's charges? ``Sour grapes,'' says Patrick
Hurley, Salon's vice president for marketing. ``When's the last
time you heard someone talk about Slate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slate won't go around licking doorknobs,'' snaps Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   But it does advertise on Salon. Even more delicious for Salon
was CNN's refusal last year to air its television ad campaign on
the grounds that an online site was a direct competitor to the TV
network.
</P>
<P>
   Love that buzz. At the end of the day, though, Salon will rise
or fall on its credibility. ``Buzz is their ideology,'' Broder
says. ``Once the fascination in the Web ends, the old rules still
apply.''

W.R. GRACE CO. RESISTED ASBESTOS LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Attn.: Mont.; a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE APPEL AND NEIL SWIDEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   W. R. Grace Co. sold millions of bags of home attic insulation
that contained asbestos, but the company never warned the public,
documents obtained by The Boston Globe show.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Grace, whose Cambridge, Mass. Construction
Products Division oversaw Zonolite Attic Insulation until it was
discontinued in 1984, knew as far back as 1963 about the asbestos.
But they were worried that a warning label would hurt sales, memos
from high-ranking Grace officials show.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos has been linked to several diseases, including lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no labeling requirement at the time, Grace did
not break the law. But documents show the company lobbied hard to
keep its product free from warning labels and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In public testimony and letters to government regulators, Grace
executives consistently argued that the attic insulation was safe.
In internal memos, they:
</P>
<P>
   --Discussed such options for keeping regulators at bay as
``obstruct and block.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tracked mounting lung cancer deaths of workers at the Grace
mine and mill where the main ingredient used in the insulation came
from.
</P>
<P>
   --Drafted a press release in 1977, citing ``health hazards'' as
their reason for discontinuing the attic insulation. The release
was never issued, however, and Grace continued to sell the
insulation for seven more years.
</P>
<P>
   W. R. Grace, a $1.5 billion multinational chemical and
construction products company, was thrust into the spotlight by the
1995 book and 1999 movie ``A Civil Action.'' Both were based on a
1982 lawsuit concerning chemical contamination and high leukemia
rates in East Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   At least three government agencies knew there was asbestos in
Grace's attic insulation while it was on the market. Current
government officials have a hard time explaining why the agencies
did not do a better job of following up on their initial concerns
with Grace's product.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency warned in a 1981
study that consumers of products made from the mineral used in
Grace's attic fill ``may be particularly vulnerable and unprotected
due to ignorance of the potential hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until earlier this month that the EPA warned
homeowners to hold off on handling Grace's attic insulation,
believed to still be in thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA made its decision during its emergency investigation of
widespread asbestos contamination in Libby, Mont., where the
material used in the Grace insulation was mined and milled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend, to the extent possible, that you hold off on any
remodeling until we know about the asbestos content of the Zonolite
insulation and any potential health effects,'' the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   Why it took the EPA nearly 20 years to issue a public warning is
unclear. ``That's a grand question,'' said Paul Peronard, the
coordinator of the EPA's Libby team.
</P>
<P>
   William Corcoran, Grace's vice president for public and
regulatory affairs, said, ``We didn't think the product was a
health hazard.'' Despite the new EPA warning, he said, Grace
officials continue to believe the product poses no risk.
</P>
<P>
   Zonolite is a loose-fill insulation that was poured between
attic rafters, under floor boards, and behind walls. It is made
from a gold-colored mineral called vermiculite, mined in Libby,
Mont., and processed at one of 32 plants around the country,
including one in Easthampton.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite asbestos was naturally present in the Libby
vermiculite and the products made from it. Grace removed some, but
not all, of the asbestos, company memos show.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite asbestos is a particularly dangerous form of the
mineral, said Dr. Jacqueline Moline, an occupational and
environmental health specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer linked to asbestos, can develop
from low exposures to tremolite, she said, ``the kind that women
got shaking out their husbands' clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, a Cambridge, Mass. homeowner, recently spent three
days removing Zonolite insulation from his attic in preparation for
a renovation. He said he did not know the insulation contains
asbestos. Though he wore a mask, he said he would have been more
careful had he known about the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disarming to learn at this late date how potentially
dangerous it is,'' he said, adding, ``I was surprised how long the
dust stayed in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he does not know how he should dispose of the
insulation, which now sits in 20 or so garbage bags in his garage.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimated in 1985 that 940,000 American homes contained,
or had contained, Zonolite attic fill, and that Grace held about 85
percent of the market for vermiculite insulation. ``You open up a
wall and it pours out,'' said Eric Anderson, owner of Anderson
Insulation in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just blow right over it,'' said Janet Baronian, assistant
director of Menotomy Weatherization, an Arlington, Mass.
weatherization program for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   All of Grace's Zonolite attic fill came from Libby vermiculite.
Vermiculite from other mines, including one operated by Grace in
Enoree, S.C., is used to make products such as cat litter and
potting soil. Those mines do not appear to be similarly
contaminated, according to Peronard, the EPA study coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos was once considered the most effective fireproofing
material available. But that changed dramatically by the mid-1970s,
as public fears grew about the health hazards of asbestos. As the
number of cases of ailments and diseases linked to the mineral
climbed, asbestos was ripped out of schools. Spackling compounds
and spray fireproofing that contained asbestos were banned, and
hair dryers with asbestos filters were voluntarily withdrawn from
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's Zonolite insulation, however, remained largely
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said that was because his company cooperated with
government agencies and was producing a safe product. ``We never
tried to hide it from anyone,'' he said. The only asbestos
standards in the 1970s were for workers, enforced by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Zonolite Attic
Insulation was designed for consumers, he said, who would have
limited exposure to it compared with workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We complied with that OSHA target at our plants, but it's a
different exposure when Harry Homeowner is involved,'' Corcoran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet OSHA cited Grace for excessive asbestos levels as early as
1976. That kind of violation involving a consumer product such as
Zonolite ``gives you an indication that there could be a problem
downstream, with other workers and consumers,'' said John Martonik,
director of OSHA's office of program evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Egilman, a clinical associate professor in the
Department of Community Health at Brown University, has been a paid
expert witness against the asbestos industry. Though he has not
testified against Grace, he has conducted extensive research on the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace has known about the hazards of asbestos since they
bought the mine in 1963. They knew the asbestos was there and how
toxic it was,'' said Egilman, who has worked a lengthy unit on
Grace into his medical ethics course. He added, ``They've engaged
in a coverup of the toxicity of their products and knowingly failed
to warn people for the purpose of making money and to avoid
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Corcoran, ``We completely reject his theories.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of hundreds of company memos shows that Grace officials
argued publicly against tougher government standards while
privately discussing their concerns about liability and the
potential dangers associated with their product.

THE POLITICAL VACUUM OF PROSPERITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There has never been a presidential campaign like
this one.
</P>
<P>
   The 1944 election was held in the 36th month of World War II.
The 1952 election was held in the 29th month of the Korean War. The
1980 election was held in the 15th month of captivity of the
American hostages in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   This week's South Carolina primary, perhaps the most important
confrontation of the Republican nomination fight in the 2000
election, is being held in the 107th month of expansion in the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   And as the presidential campaign moves south and west we are
witnessing the development of a an entirely new, different brand of
politics. Call it the politics of prosperity: a new American
dialogue that omits most of the major issues of traditional
politics, including the economy and foreign policy, and instead
emphasizes issues that have been at the periphery of politics, such
as campaign-finance overhaul and education that, until now, have
had difficulty muscling to center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontations between the wealthy and the striving, the
fights about national priorities in times of limited resources, the
struggles over how (or whether) to cushion the vulnerable from the
vicissitudes of the marketplace _ all these, the staples of
American politics, have been swept off the table by the comforting
breeze of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still poverty and there's still inequality, but it's a
very strong economy and it's hard to run against the economy,''
says Robert Feinberg, an American University economist. ``With the
exception of some extreme views, there's very little criticism of
the Fed, very little criticism of the thrust of Clinton's economic
policy, very little to complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's complaining, for example, about inflation, which is at
2.7 percent. Unemployment, which was at 7.3 percent when Bill
Clinton was elected, now is at 4.1 percent as the nation prepares
to select his successor. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sits
above 11,400 _ more than three times higher than the 3,301 level it
hit in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked anyone when this recovery began in 1992 what the
chances of getting the unemployment rate down to around 4 percent
they would have laughed their heads off,'' says Frank Levy, an MIT
economist. ``They would say that even if you could get that low,
which you couldn't, you'd have high inflation. Well we did get that
low and we don't have that inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the candidates struggling to win the attention
and votes of Americans in the early primary states are also
struggling to fashion a new kind of politics. In this politics of
prosperity, all the guide posts of the past have been removed, all
the navigational buoys that have guided candidates have drifted,
all the assumptions have been altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This great prosperity allows people to talk about things like
Elian Gonzalez and concentrate on more particularized issues like
education and health,'' says Tamu Buhr, a political scientist at
Harvard University. ``There are whole bunch of things you don't
have to focus on, like jobs. Instead you can talk about cutting
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of prosperity calls upon Americans to make no
sacrifices; in President Clinton's State of the Union Message late
last month, in the budget he presented last week, and in the
appeals of all the Democratic and Republican presidential
candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire and, now, South Carolina and
the West, there is no call for selflessness, no incantation about
the future dividends that current sacrifices will bring.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of prosperity includes only the most casual bows to
the concerns of the poor; even the Democrats, traditionally the
voice of the underdogs, are pitching their stump speeches to
suburban, middle-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of prosperity, moreover, has become the politics of
politics. This is the rare election when the conversation is
dominated not by what politics is for (creating economic growth,
for example, or easing the burden of poverty) but by how we conduct
our politics _ whether the ads are negative (a major issue last
week in South Carolina) or whether a candidate's supporters are
rude (a question raised in New Hampshire), or whether the big
interests get too much influence (one of the big issues in Iowa in
January).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the principal issue in 2000 may well be campaign-finance
reform, which is a classic prosperity issue, one that may
ultimately involve the distribution of wealth but more immediately
involves the distribution of political power.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgent Republican candidate, Senator John McCain of
Arizona, has made an overhaul of the campaign-finance system his
leading issue, and though former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey
has tried to make campaign-finance his ticket to the Democratic
nomination, Vice President Al Gore of Tennessee, himself a
prodigious fund-raiser under President Clinton, has positioned
himself as a strong advocate of changing the system as well.
</P>
<P>
   Issues like that have been at the periphery of modern American
politics, but never at the center. Common Cause, the self-styled
citizens' lobby, tried to make special-interest money a major issue
in 1988 without much success, and when picketers pestered GOP
Senator Robert J. Dole of Kansas about blocking an overhaul of the
campaign-finance system in the Senate, he was able to dismiss the
criticism with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy economy has provided a vacuum in the political area
that is being filled by these other issues. A decade ago, only 27
percent of the nation believed it was financially better off than a
year earlier. Now the figure is 53 percent. A decade ago, half of
Americans thought that economic conditions in the nation were
getting worse, as against a third who believed that conditions were
getting better. Right now the figures are completely reversed, with
a third believing things are getting worse and a half believing
conditions are improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that things are going well means people don't have to
focus just on themselves,'' says Fred Wertheimer, a former Common
Cause president. ``The fights in 1980s were much different from the
fights now in 2000. The dimension of the big-money problem is much
larger now, of course,but the harder the economic times, the less
willing people are to listen to things that don't relate directly
to economics. With better times, they can look at the things that
need to be dealt with but sometimes aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the politcal landscape is almost completely
altered. A dozen years ago, Governor Michael S. Dukakis of
Massachusetts won the Democratic presidential nomination with a
promise of ``good jobs at good wages,'' a phrase that would seem
quaintly out of place on the campaign trail today. Democrats don't
have to make vows like that anymore, or at least right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though things were pretty good in 1988 there were whole
regions of the countries that were in terrible shape,'' says
Dukakis, who is teaching this semester at UCLA. ``Remember the Rust
Belt? South Texas was in trouble. Huge parts of the country were
not sharing in prosperity. There was a lot for a Democrat to talk
about in 1988. There's less for a Republican challenger in 2000 to
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The low level of enthusiasm for the basic GOP chestnut, lowering
Americans' taxes, is a measure of the difficulty that Republicans
face in the new atmosphere _ and helps to explain the success
McCain enjoyed in New Hampshire and the surge he is experiencing in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it hard for the Republicans, because they're usually
in the position of saying they're the party that can bring the
economy back to where it should be,'' says Ann Crigler, a political
scientist at the Unruh Institue of Politics at University of
Southern California. ``They can't say that this time, because it's
going gang-busters. But if things turn bad, they'll take full
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In these good times, the traditional tactics aren't working.
Governor George W. Bush of Texas emphasized his tax-cut plan in the
most tax-averse state in the nation, New Hampshire, and still lost
the primary by 19 percentage points. Only one in 10 of McCain's
supporters in New Hampshire identified a tax cut as their top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the candidates have been emphasizing education,
health, veterans and social issues. They are the topics that have
seldom been at the heart of a presidential election. The
Republicans sought to make education an important issue in 1988,
for example, but it was crowded out by issues of government
spending and questions about reducing the tax on capital gains. The
Democrats began to make health care an issue in 1992, but turned to
the economy and the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Only now is a new politics of prosperity blossoming. The health
of the economy, and the absence of foreign threats, have given
these other issues breathing room _ and attention.

REFORM STOCK JUST KEEPS SINKING AND ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Reform Party just keeps getting more pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   You might have figured that this political circus act founded by
Ross Perot had hit rock bottom when Pat Buchanan emerged as the
leading candidate for the party's presidential nomination. Or when
Donald Trump stepped forward as the most viable alternative to
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Reformers lost their top elected official and
only bona fide celebrity when Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura quit the
party and dismissed it as ``hopelessly dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unworthy of my support and the support of the American
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's declaration that the Reform Party is unworthy of
support surely came as no shock to most Americans. The voters left
little doubt where they stood on the issue of the party's
worthiness when they all but ignored Perot's presidential candidacy
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, in fact, had fared much better when he ran as an
independent four years earlier. It was obvious to most Americans
that he conjured up the Reform Party for no reason except to prop
up his second run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The party was a joke when Perot founded it, and it's still a
joke. Ventura was kind when he described the Reform Party as
``dysfunctional,'' since the term suggests that the party actually
functioned somewhere along the line.
</P>
<P>
   It never did. It never will.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we find ourselves caught up in an unproductive endeavor,
it is wise to cut our losses and move on,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why so many Americans appreciate Ventura. He's no Rhodes
scholar, but he has ``common sense'' to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-wrestler says he has no plans to run for president, but
he's been around the block. He knows that politicians who deny any
interest in running for president sometimes change their minds _
and he knows that only a fool would try to get himself elected
president on the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Which might tell us all we need to know about Pat Buchanan.
Donald Trump is another story; early reports Friday suggested that
he wouldn't seek the Reform nomination in the wake of Ventura's
desertion of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it doesn't matter all that much whether the Reform
Party nominates Buchanan, Trump or even the party's founder and
resident scheming weasel, Ross Perot. This outfit will make no
meaningful contribution to the political process and will have no
impact on the presidential election in 2000 _ or any other year,
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who keep trying to palm off the Reform Party as a
legitimate participant in the process would like us to believe that
the party was created for the purpose of providing voters with an
alternative to the policies of the Democratic and Republican
parties. But that's a difficult premise to buy into when you
consider that the Reform Party has no policies of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Reformers' idea of an alternative is: ``We're
not them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's catchy. But it's not much for voters to hang their hats on,
policy-wise.
</P>
<P>
   One of the popular rationales for third parties and independent
candidacies in this country is that there's not a ``dime's worth of
difference'' between the Democrats and the Republicans. But that
complaint just doesn't hold up.
</P>
<P>
   It's plain to see, even at this early stage of the presidential
campaign, that on most issues Democrats and Republicans have very
different ideas and have very different approaches to solving the
nation's problems. And it's even plainer to see that the Democratic
president and the Republican leadership in Congress are miles
apart, not just in terms of partisan politics but in terms of their
beliefs about the appropriate role of government in the lives of
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that both parties need to be more responsive
to the people. But the people have the power to make them more
responsive by being more involved.
</P>
<P>
   The major parties will get better if the voters demand
improvement. The Reform Party will just keep getting more pathetic.

A LAGGING BRADLEY PUT HIS HOPES ON A LATE AD BLITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Glancing up from their double lattes and
cappuccinos, patrons of a trendy downtown cafe last week witnessed
Bill Bradley peering in from the sidewalk, his right hand reaching
toward them.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was on the move, urgently trying to close Vice President
Al Gore's large lead in the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination. With little time to linger, Bradley paused, smiled, and
pantomimed handshakes with coffee drinkers he couldn't touch.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in the winter of Bradley's campaign for the
presidency. In ways he may not have imagined when he bet that he
could overcome an incumbent vice president, Bradley is on the
outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   All but pushed from the national stage by three consecutive
primary losses and Arizona Senator John McCain's surging ascendance
in the Republican contest, Bradley has seen McCain hijack the
stardom and momentum that Bradley had once counted on seizing.
</P>
<P>
   From the shadows, Bradley soldiers on, searching for a
breakthrough, even as a sense of urgency infects some of his
soldiers. ``If we don't toughen up,'' one of Bradley's national
operatives said with unusual candor, ``Gore is going to win this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But how Bradley could ``toughen up'' enough to rescue his
candidacy poses a quandary. He has made no secret of his charisma
deficit, acknowledging in his 1996 book, ``Time Present, Time
Past,'' that he had bypassed previous runs for the presidency
because of ``my continuing stage fright, and my inability to rouse
people as a speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Bradley is banking more on the power of his
message. He is counting on defying polls that show the public is
more comfortable with Gore's preference for incremental change than
Bradley's sweeping plans to overhaul the health care system and
eliminate child poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley, convinced that his campaign is ``smarter'' than
Gore's, is anticipating that voters will flock to him when they
focus on the contest in the final countdown to the decisive March 7
primaries. ``I still think I have a great chance to be the
nominee,'' he said before his sidewalk pantomime.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Bradley is planning a last-ditch,
multimillion-dollar ad campaign that could make or break his
candidacy. His advisers will not discuss the substance, tone, or
breadth of the ad blitz, which is expected to start within a week
after Saturday's Republican primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude, Bradley last week dusted off a television
endorsement that basketball superstar Michael Jordan had taped for
him before Christmas. The ad is airing from Maine to California,
but there is scant evidence yet that Jordan's pitch will make the
difference Bradley needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it could do for Bradley is cause voters to look seriously
at him for the first time,'' said Dan Payne, a Boston-based
Democratic consultant who is neutral in the presidential race.
``But it's up to Bradley to persuade them that he will do things
that are worthy of their support.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of Bradley's demise is palpable, as polls show him
trailing badly in the largest of the 15 states that go to polls
March 7. If he fails to meet his minimum goal of winning at least
some of the states, Bradley could mothball his campaign by March 8.
Until then, Bradley has two major opportunities to trip up Gore:
debates on Feb. 21 in Harlem and March 1 in Los Angeles. In their
last debate, in New Hampshire, Bradley launched his first offensive
against Gore, forcing the vice president to go on the defensive for
days.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley may need fresh ammunition if he is to break Gore's
stride again. But his crew of researchers, speechwriters, and
advisers, which is skeletal next to Gore's, appears to have left
little unmined as it digs for ways to get tough on the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley took the offensive in New Hampshire, after months
of absorbing criticism without rebuttal, he challenged Gore's
honesty and integrity and blasted his past opposition to federally
funded abortions. Last week, Bradley chided Gore as a ``poster
child'' for the National Rifle Association for backing NRA
initiatives when he served in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley continues to criticize Gore's role in the 1996
Democratic fund-raising scandal, arguing that if Democrats find no
other reason to dump Gore, they should reject him because the
scandal's taint could make him unelectable, Bradley says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore continues to soar in the polls, a phenomenon that
Bradley attributed in part to the media's massive coverage of
McCain's surging candidacy and their waning interest in the
Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, empty seats have outnumbered occupied ones on Bradley's
campaign plane and press bus as he has stumped in New York,
Florida, South Carolina, Ohio, Missouri, Washington, and California
since the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for Bradley, surveys show McCain gobbling up support
from independents at Bradley's expense. Bradley had banked on
independents to register as Democrats to propel him in several key
states on March 7 and to bolster his case that he would be more
electable than Gore in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the grim outlook, Bradley met privately with contributors
in San Francisco Saturday night and assured them he has a plan to
win. Just before the meeting, he attended a youth basketball clinic
with several of his former professional basketball colleagues in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   There, Bradley preached the virtue of resilience. ``The real
question is, what do you have to bring you back after you've gone
down?'' he said, flanked by past basketball greats Bill Russell of
the Boston Celtics and Julius Erving of the Philadelphia 76ers.
``What is it inside you that makes you realize that adversity
somehow strengthens you?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told the youths, seated before him on a gym floor, that
he draws daily on his experiences in basketball to steel him in his
presidential campaign. And Russell reminded the crowd that Bradley
overcame his limitations to reach the top of his sport, two NBA
championships, and a place in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left the gym with less than a month before March 7 to
demonstrate his political resilience.

 UNDATED: ... their product.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1973, Washington state safety and health officials found high
readings of asbestos at Grace's Spokane plant and advised the
company to place a ``Caution _ contains asbestos'' label on the
attic fill made there.
</P>
<P>
   A Grace official suggested in a Dec. 4, 1973, memo to a vice
president that the company tell the authorities they were
correcting the problems. The memo further stated that ``the word
asbestos has become a real scare word and we are very concerned
about having to put a label on our product when we don't really
believe it is a significant hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1976, OSHA cited Grace's Omaha plant for asbestos
exposure levels from its attic insulation that exceeded both the
agency's 8-hour and 15-minute ceilings for workplace safety. If the
problem was not corrected, regulators warned, they would require a
warning label. Grace estimated it took about two hours for
homeowners to install its attic insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Grace executives responded that no label was needed and if a
problem existed, it could be corrected. They received a one-year
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Within the company, executives discussed company tests showing
high asbestos in attic insulation made at a number of Grace's
plants. They worried about future OSHA inspections and ordered a
series of experiments to try to coat the vermiculite with a
``binder,'' a substance that would prevent fibers from being
released, according to a March 11, 1976, memo. A successful binder
would free them from having to label.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1976, a tougher OSHA asbestos standard went into effect.
Grace tested throughout 1977, sometimes in Cambridge, but memos
show the company had inconsistent results.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1977, Grace produced a series of draft press releases
in preparation for possibly having to pull its attic insulation and
other asbestos-containing products off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The company is ``sufficiently concerned about the entire issue
of asbestos and associated health hazards to discontinue this
product,'' one draft said. Attic insulation ``must be safe beyond
any doubt whatsoever to meet Grace's product standards for sale to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Grace discontinued its attic insulation seven years later _
for economic reasons, Corcoran said _ there was no public
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, 1977, a Grace executive vice president in Cambridge
circulated to top management a 20-page ``personal and
confidential'' memo that discussed Grace's options for dealing with
``the problem'' of asbestos in the Libby vermiculite. ``An in-house
study of mortality rates among ex-employees at Libby indicates that
their risk of lung cancer is five times the national average,'' the
memo said. It also noted that 28 percent of veteran workers at its
many processing plants had been diagnosed with asbestosis, a
debilitating scarring of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The memo reaffirmed Grace's opposition to warning labels. ``We
believe that a decision to affix asbestos warning labels to our
products would result in substantial sales losses.'' It discussed
the option of closing the Libby mine, but rejected it because a
buyer would be difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, an OSHA office in Ohio learned that 32 workers at the
O.M. Scotts and Sons fertilizer plant in Marysville were sick _
they were bleeding into their lungs. The plant made Scotts Turf
Builder, and its main ingredient was Libby vermiculite purchased
from Grace.
</P>
<P>
   This time, word of the illnesses spread beyond a local OSHA
office. By 1980, the EPA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission,
and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health _
OSHA's research arm _ all wanted information about Grace's
vermiculite operations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
proposed a formal study. In November 1980, Grace executives met
with institute officials to argue against it. ``A viral infection
was a more likely Scott explanation than vermiculite,'' one
executive told the officials, according to a Nov. 26, 1980, Grace
memo.
</P>
<P>
   The institute officials were not swayed. They said they would
send Grace a study plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Grace executives said they could respond to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health plan in a number of
ways, including: ``obstruct and block,'' ``publish a pre-emptive
epidemiological study,'' ``cooperate fully,'' or ``attempt to apply
influence via congressmen, senators, lobbyists or others to get it
turned off,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the EPA told Grace it wanted to study the Libby
facility and the company's processing plants. The EPA agreed to
Grace's request to significantly scale back the research. The
agency ended up basing much of its study on estimates rather than
data.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1979, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced that it was going to issue a rule asking companies to
send test results showing the amount of asbestos in their products.
</P>
<P>
   On March 12, 1980, Grace executives called the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the call we learned that vermiculite was not a high
priority at CPSC . . .'' a Sept. 30, 1980, memo stated.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, the executive vice president of Grace's Construction
Products Division sought the company's exemption from any
forthcoming labeling policy.
</P>
<P>
   The letter included 1977 test results of attic insulation that
had been treated with a binder. The executive said the company had
developed a binder and ``recently started up equipment at all its
expanding plants to apply this binder to attic insulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Internally, however, Grace executives were not confident about
the test results.
</P>
<P>
   The Construction Products Division ``does have concern with
attic insulation as shown in the test results,'' stated a March 25,
1980, Grace memo from a project manager to a vice president. The
division's research department was ``continuing binder efforts, but
I see little light at the end of this tunnel during the next 12
months,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA released its final report in 1985, concluding that
exposure to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite is ``an occupational
and consumer concern.'' The National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health report came a year later, recommending a much
lower asbestos exposure limit. That limit is in effect today.
</P>
<P>
   Grace closed its Libby mine in 1990. It opened an office there
late last year to act as a resource for residents and the EPA
during the investigation, Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, deaths in Libby continue to mount. ``Every week there
are more diagnosed,'' said Gayla Benefield, a Libby resident who
said both her parents died from asbestos-related illnesses. ``We
just want to get to the bottom of this.''

<P>
   BUDAPEST _ Serbian officials were taking emergency measures
Sunday against a waterborne cloud of cyanide that is wiping out
plant and animal life as it travels down the Tisza River, in one of
Europe's worst environmental disasters since Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of fish have been killed and drinking water supplies
contaminated on the Tisza, one of the region's main waterways,
since the cyanide leaked from a mine in western Romania, near the
border city of Oradea on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian and Serbian officials say the spillage is an
environmental catastrophe, causing immense damage to the region's
fragile ecosystem that could take years to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the fish in the Tisza have died since the
cyanide reached Serbia, said Attila Juhas, mayor of the northern
Serbian town of Senta. ``Enormous quantities of dead fish are
floating on the surface and the spill continues to spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants in northern Serbia have already removed fish from
their menus, and the alarm has spread south as far as the capital,
Belgrade, which lies on the Danube some 80 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Branislav Blazic, Serbia's environment minister, said Serbia
will demand compensation from those responsible for the cyanide
spill
</P>
<P>
   ``It is astonishing that somebody let something like this
happen. The Tisza has been killed. Not even bacteria have
survived,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blazic claimed the initial concentration of the cyanide in
Romania must have been enormous if the effects are still so deadly
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The cyanide cloud is travelling at 2.5 miles an hour and Sunday
hit the Danube, east Europe's main waterway, in northern Serbia.
Sections of the Danube are already heavily polluted after the NATO
bombing campaign last year that targeted oil and gas refineries.
</P>
<P>
   From there the poison is likely to travel downriver, through
Serbia and could reach Bulgaria, where the Danube empties into the
Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of several towns in northern Serbia on the Tisza say
their stretches of the river are now completely dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tisza will practically become a dead river in 10-15 hours
in the municipality of Kanjiza,'' said town mayor Istvan Baskonyi
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency teams have been removing tons of dead fish by hand
from the river while signs have been posted by the river bank in
northern Serbia, warning locals to stay away from the Tisza, and
not to fish or swim in its waters.
</P>
<P>
   Over 100,000 cubic meters of contaminated water was released. A
cyanide solution is used in mining to separate gold ore from
surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cyanide pollution of the Tisza River has led to the
greatest extermination of fish life in Central Europe to date,''
Karoly Pinter, head of the wild life department of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Regional Development, on Tuesday told the Hungarian
state-run news agency MTI.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists have pointed out that some of the fish are on the
endangered list and most likely have been totally wiped out. It
will take three or more months to assess the full extent of the
damage as much of the upper Tisza is covered by ice.
</P>
<P>
   Cyanide use is forbidden in the European Union, but Romania is
not a member.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Romanian Environment Ministry confirmed reports
that the Romanian-Australian company running the mine was closed
soon after the cyanide spill. The ministry has sued the company,
spokeswoman Carla Chivu said.
</P>
<P>
   Its manager, Philip J. Evers, an Australian engineer, told the
Hungarian daily Nepszava that the mine's reservoir holding highly
poisonous chemical waste from the mine overflowed after what he
called unprecedented rain and snowfalls in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary is seeking compensation from Romania, although there are
no bilateral agreements on such issues between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   State-run Hungarian radio reported officials confirming that a
second cyanide spill occurred Feb. 6, but its level of
concentration was much lower, 60 times the acceptable level. &QL;

A NEW OPENING FOR `REAR WINDOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDFORD HILLS, N.Y. _ Robert Harris leans over a workbench in his
office, surrounded by strips and spools of film, unwinding one reel
until he finds the frame he's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at this,'' he says, placing it under a magnifying
lens. It's the famous close-up near the beginning of Alfred
Hitchcock's ``Rear Window,'' where Grace Kelly leans over and
kisses a sleeping Jimmy Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The frame is from a print of the original 1954 negative. It's
grainy, dark _ you can barely see Stewart's face _ and drenched in
a murky yellow-green.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it looked like when we received it,'' Harris says.
``That's &UR;  &LR; what we were dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he shows me a print of the same frame after he and his
colleague, Jim Katz, were done with it. Stewart is in Kelly's
shadow, but his features are clear, flesh tones are natural, and
the background is well detailed. There's a crisp air to the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Harris says, with a satisfied grin, ``is what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Katz are co-proprietors of the Film Preserve Ltd.,
located an hour's train ride north of Manhattan, and known as the
most fastidious firm involved anywhere in the art and science of
film restoration.
</P>
<P>
   There are other exceedingly careful workers in the field, most
notably at the Library of Congress, the UCLA Film Archives, the
Academy of Motion Pictures, and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Pollock, chairman of the American Film Institute and a
former head of Universal Pictures, says of Harris and Katz,
``They're, by far, the best at what they do. They're
perfectionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Their restoration of ``Rear Window'' is their latest project _
sponsored, as is all their work, by the studio releasing it (in
this case, Universal) _ and when it opened last month at Film Forum
in Manhattan, critics were agog at its lifelike beauty. It opens
nationwide on Friday, when it will screen at the Brattle Theatre in
Cambridge, where it will run through Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Katz have restored just four other feature films in
the past 14 years _ ``Lawrence of Arabia'' (which Harris worked on
solo), ``My Fair Lady,'' ``Spartacus,'' and ``Vertigo.'' They spend
two years, day in and day out, on each project, at a cost to the
studio ranging from $650,000 (for the 35mm ``Rear Window'') to $1.2
million (for the wider-screen ``Vertigo'' and ``My Fair Lady'').
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of reissues called ``restorations'' out there,
but many are misleadingly labeled _ new prints of old films, maybe
scrubbed down a bit, but, Harris insists, ``They're not
`restorations.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do,'' he says of his own practice, ``is restore the
film from the ground up. We deal with problems on a shot-by-shot,
frame-by-frame basis. Our edict is to produce a new negative and a
new print that make the film look as much like it did when it first
came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Their purity often takes them to extremes. Unless they are kept
in cold, dry storage (and until a decade or so ago, they rarely
were), color films fade with time. So when Harris and Katz restored
Hitchcock's ``Vertigo,'' they obtained a chip from a 1957 green
Jaguar _ the car Kim Novak drives in the film _ in order to restore
the color to exactly the right shade of green. ``There's green, and
then there's green,'' Harris notes.
</P>
<P>
   When they did ``My Fair Lady,'' they went to Gene Allen, the
film's production designer, to find out the exact shade of white
used on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Rear Window,'' they found Georgine Darcy, the actress who
played the scantily clad dancer that Stewart watches frolicking in
her apartment across the way. She had kept the pink shorts she wore
in the film, and let Harris and Katz borrow them so they could get
that color exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no other film restorers go to such lengths. Ask Harris
why they bother, and he looks puzzled. ``If you know what you're
doing,'' he replies, ``why not do it right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is, we're sitting down with the filmmaker and
we're saying, `Thank you for what you're done in making this film.
Here's some way of giving it back to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 54, grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. His father had friends in
the movie industry, and would receive cartons and cartons of 16mm
film reels, films from the '40s, which Harris would stay up and
watch all night. By age 10, he was a movie buff.
</P>
<P>
   He went to film school at New York University, got involved in
film distribution, and helped Kevin Brownlow piece together Abel
Gance's long-lost silent classic, ``Napoleon,'' the mother of all
film restorations and, as it turned out, a fabulous success.
</P>
<P>
   He developed a crusader's passion for saving old films. His
favorite was ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' which he knew had been
shortened from 222 minutes to 187. He wanted to find that missing
35 minutes and release it in full.
</P>
<P>
   The executives at Columbia, who didn't even know anything was
missing, let him into their vaults. He tracked down the film's
editor, Anne Coates, who put him in touch with the director, Sir
David Lean, who ended up working at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, Katz, who was president of Universal's
classics division, struck a deal with Alfred Hitchcock's estate to
reissue the five films _ ``The Man Who Knew Too Much,''
``Vertigo,'' ``Rope,'' ``The Trouble With Harry,'' and ``Rear
Window'' _ that had reverted to family ownership decades ago and
had been out of circulation ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real ballyhoo, with big premieres that Jimmy
Stewart attended, but the thing that struck me,'' Katz recalls,
``was that the condition of these films was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz had also just signed to release ``Napoleon,'' and met
Harris. When he started bemoaning the dreadful condition of the
Hitchcock films, Harris said he could do something about that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, they became business partners. ``Bob's the technical
guy, I put the deals together,'' explains Katz, who also has a
production company in Hollywood. ``I have a lot more contacts than
he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are frustrated, mournful even, that the guardians of the
jewels, the heads of the studios, have shirked their
responsibilities over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These films are antiques,'' Harris says. ``You can have a
Shakespeare folio that's 400 years old and, if you're careful, you
can turn the pages, you can read it. But you look at a film from
1964 _ it's fading, the perforations are cracked, it's falling
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Some studios try. ``If you go through Universal's vaults, those
films are stored at 34 degrees Fahrenheit and 25 percent
humidity,'' he says. ``On the other hand, in 1986, at Columbia,
when I started `Lawrence,' the vaults were in a converted bowling
alley at 68 degrees. My jaw dropped. If you know anything about
photographic emulsion, you know that's too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the problems date back to a decision made by the
studios in the early 1950s. Until then, Technicolor movies were
shot on three strips of black-and-white film stock. The strips _
each containing the information for yellow, cyan, and magenta, the
full range of the color spectrum _ were run through three dyes and
then printed, one layer on top of another, in a way that
corresponded to the degrees of light and dark on the negative.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is that the original negatives were not in color,
and so, they have not faded.
</P>
<P>
   Making prints from these dyes was a slow process, however, and
in 1950, Eastman Kodak came up with a color film you could load
right in the camera. For a while, the studios continued to print
even Eastman film with Technicolor dyes, but, from then on, the
original negatives would be in color. And over time, they have
faded.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``Rear Window'' restoration, Harris took the Eastman
color negative, filtered it onto three separate strips of
black-and-white film stock _ the yellow, cyan, and magenta _ then
printed the mix with special dyes at Technicolor's lab.
</P>
<P>
   There were two remarkable things here. First, it marked the
first time anyone has used Technicolor's three-dye process since
Francis Ford Coppola shot ``The Godfather Part II'' in 1974.
Second, because the Eastman negative had faded, Harris and
Technicolor's engineers had to fiddle with the colors, varying the
degree of yellow, cyan, and magenta. And because the levels of
distortion on the negative were far from uniform, they had to alter
the mix hundreds of times _ ``literally from shot to shot,'' Harris
says.
</P>
<P>
   The studio vaults are apparently crammed with horror tales. The
original negative for ``Citizen Kane'' is gone, burned in a fire,
as is the three-strip Technicolor negative for ``Singing in the
Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The disasters are not limited to vintage films. ``Chinatown''
and ``The Godfather'' are fading fast. The special effects for
``Star Wars,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' and
``Superman'' were printed on a film stock that, it turned out,
fades after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Studios are paying more attention to preservation than in the
past, partly because of the rise of DVDs, which have much sharper
images than laser discs or VHS tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hide a multitude of sins on video, which you can't
do so easily on DVD,'' Harris says. ``The question is, how long
will it take to rescue all these films? Will the rescue come too
late?''

   BUDAPEST _ Serbian officials were taking emergency measures
Sunday against a waterborne cloud of cyanide that is wiping out
plant and animal life as it travels down the Tisza River, in one of
Europe's worst environmental disasters since Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of fish have been killed and drinking water supplies
contaminated on the Tisza, one of the region's main waterways,
since the cyanide leaked from a mine in western Romania, near the
border city of Oradea on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian and Serbian officials say the spillage is an
environmental catastrophe, causing immense damage to the region's
fragile ecosystem that could take years to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the fish in the Tisza have died since the
cyanide reached Serbia, said Attila Juhas, mayor of the northern
Serbian town of Senta. ``Enormous quantities of dead fish are
floating on the surface and the spill continues to spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants in northern Serbia have already removed fish from
their menus, and the alarm has spread south as far as the capital,
Belgrade, which lies on the Danube some 80 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Branislav Blazic, Serbia's environment minister, said Serbia
will demand compensation from those responsible for the cyanide
spill
</P>
<P>
   ``It is astonishing that somebody let something like this
happen. The Tisza has been killed. Not even bacteria have
survived,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blazic claimed the initial concentration of the cyanide in
Romania must have been enormous if the effects are still so deadly
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The cyanide cloud is travelling at 2.5 miles an hour and Sunday
hit the Danube, east Europe's main waterway, in northern Serbia.
Sections of the Danube are already heavily polluted after the NATO
bombing campaign last year that targeted oil and gas refineries.
</P>
<P>
   From there the poison is likely to travel downriver, through
Serbia and could reach Bulgaria, where the Danube empties into the
Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of several towns in northern Serbia on the Tisza say
their stretches of the river are now completely dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tisza will practically become a dead river in 10-15 hours
in the municipality of Kanjiza,'' said town mayor Istvan Baskonyi
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency teams have been removing tons of dead fish by hand
from the river while signs have been posted by the river bank in
northern Serbia, warning locals to stay away from the Tisza, and
not to fish or swim in its waters.
</P>
<P>
   Over 100,000 cubic meters of contaminated water was released. A
cyanide solution is used in mining to separate gold ore from
surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cyanide pollution of the Tisza River has led to the
greatest extermination of fish life in Central Europe to date,''
Karoly Pinter, head of the wild life department of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Regional Development, on Tuesday told the Hungarian
state-run news agency MTI.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists have pointed out that some of the fish are on the
endangered list and most likely have been totally wiped out. It
will take three or more months to assess the full extent of the
damage as much of the upper Tisza is covered by ice.
</P>
<P>
   Cyanide use is forbidden in the European Union, but Romania is
not a member.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Romanian Environment Ministry confirmed reports
that the Romanian-Australian company running the mine was closed
soon after the cyanide spill. The ministry has sued the company,
spokeswoman Carla Chivu said.
</P>
<P>
   Its manager, Philip J. Evers, an Australian engineer, told the
Hungarian daily Nepszava that the mine's reservoir holding highly
poisonous chemical waste from the mine overflowed after what he
called unprecedented rain and snowfalls in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary is seeking compensation from Romania, although there are
no bilateral agreements on such issues between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   State-run Hungarian radio reported officials confirming that a
second cyanide spill occurred Feb. 6, but its level of
concentration was much lower, 60 times the acceptable level. &QL;

   HARARE _ As most of the millions who are sending and receiving
roses for Valentine's Day today (Monday) know only too well, the
path of true love is a rough one.
</P>
<P>
   The rose growers of Zimbabwe, where many Valentine roses began
their journey, will tell you that the path from tropical farm to
British florist is not particularly smooth either.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brown and his staff toiled for long days under the African
sun, overcame chronic diesel shortages caused by the country being
at war in the Congo, and had a brush with the airline hijacking at
Stansted Airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not think of rose growing as an exciting, breakneck
business but we have three days to get our roses from here to shops
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around Valentine's Day every minute counts,'' said Brown. He
manages 87 pickers and other staff on the 100-hectare (250-acre)
Bartlett Farm, situated 90km (60 miles) from Zimbabwe's capital,
Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is immense. ``We have to deal with downy mildew,
powder mildew, red spider and aphids, and that is before we have
picked the roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when we think our problems are over, we hear of the
Stansted hijacking and planes being diverted. That kind of thing
can be a disaster for our timing,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time in its 11 years of rose growing,
Bartlett Farm hit Valentine's Day ``spot on,'' said Brown. That
meant getting a peak number of red roses, as opposed to yellow,
pink or white, to early maturity and on to a cargo flight by last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The feat required impeccable timing but also the less
predictable cooperation of the sun. ``A week of overcast weather
can change everything,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   So can the calendar: the weekend that has preceded the lovers'
feast this year means Zimbabwean roses on sale in Britain Monday
were cut last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pickers emerge from their houses, walking through the long
grass surrounding the rose plantation, just as dawn gives way to
the first rays of sunlight at 6 a.m. They earn slightly more than
the minimum wage, but with housing and water provided by the farm.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at record levels in Zimbabwe, most people are
just grateful for a job.

SOBIN'S LUSH LANGUAGE BRINGS OUT THE SCENT OF TRUFFLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE FLY-TRUFFLER 
By Gustaf Sobin 
Norton, 155 pp., $19.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After his young wife dies, Philippe Cabassac, a middle-aged
professor of a dying Provencal language, loses interest in
everything except hunting for black truffles on the land his family
has owned for generations. From November through March he truffles
the age-old way, trying to spot the tiny flies that lay their eggs
in the earth just above the precious, richly-scented fungi.
</P>
<P>
   For Cabassac the truffles are more than just a winter delicacy.
Eating them enables him to enter a vivid dream world in which he is
reunited with Julieta.
</P>
<P>
   Gustaf Sobin is an American poet and novelist who has lived in
Provence for 35 years and clearly has come to know his adopted home
as intimately as any outsider could hope to. His style is
poetic &UR;  &LR; and &UR;  &LR; richly symbolic, so evocative of the Provencal
landscape that, reading certain passages, you can almost smell the
truffles.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time Sobin's poetic prose turns a tad purple, as in
this passage, when Cabassac imagines he and Julieta are making love
during a dream facilitated by ``an especially succulent truffle
omelette'': ``Slowly, languorously, without the least trace of
precipitation, they'd moved for hours, it seemed, cradled by a
rhythm as telluric as it was corporal. Like some kind of mild
earthen pulsation, that rhythm beat _ syncretic _ through their
very bodies. Throbbed, unabated, through the furthest reaches of
their being.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``The Fly-Truffler'' isn't as overwrought as that
particular paragraph, but Sobin's writing style does tend to the
exquisite. But his lush style suits his story, a haunted, haunting
tale of obsessive love.
</P>
<P>
   Cabassac first sees Julieta sitting in the back of the dark,
gloomy auditorium during his introductory lecture on Provencal
linguistics. For weeks he watches her in class: ``Taking note after
note, she'd glance up, occasionally, less with her eyes, it seemed,
than with her tall mineral forehead.''
</P>
<P>
   That tall mineral forehead may puzzle some readers (which
mineral?), but to Cabassac, it marks her as ``Alpine Provencal.''
Everything about her embodies the landscape he loves. She is
``redolent of altitude . . . spoke of rocks and cascades, of wild,
resinous stands of pinewood.''
</P>
<P>
   Julieta is an orphan, convent-reared, her background a mystery.
She is strangely quiet and passive, inspiring Cabassac to want to
``fill her with sound, sprinkle her long silences with a plethora
of spoken particles.''
</P>
<P>
   She tells Cabassac that she has always been drawn to the
mountains. Before long the two are living together platonically
(``His love had taken on the form of a chaste veneration from the
very first'') in his rambling old farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends they travel to Haute Provence, to persue a shared
passion for recording what Cabassac calls ``breath relics,''
vestiges of the old Gallo-Romanic language preserved in certain
high, isolated Alpine communities. They interview old men and
women, peasants, sheepherders, and silkworm farmers. Cabassac
realizes that Julieta has more than an academic interest in
linguistics. She is looking for her identity in the obsolescent
language.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably Cabassac's ``chaste veneration'' of Julieta falls
away. (What kind of story would this be if it didn't?) She becomes
pregnant. Everything changes. Cabassac is so besotted with Julieta
that he wants her all to himself. He hides an unworthy secret: He
resents the child she's carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Julieta miscarries, grieves, dies. Cabassac loses interest in
everyday life. He stumbles through his lectures. His classes
dwindle. He's forced to sell off his estate, piece by piece, to
support himself. He lives only for his truffle dreams of Julieta:
``Come those winter nights, he'd ingest a dark, savorous tuber and
enter what he himself called that dispousicioun. Dreaming entire
episodes _ whole glossy sequences that unreeled like film strip and
lasted, it seemed, like little eternities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fly-Truffler'' is not so much about love as about
obsession, a subject Sobin explored in his two previous novels,
``Venus Blue'' and ``Dark Mirrors.'' It's also about the limits of
communication and the power of secrets. (And it may be the first
novel that deals with the pathology of truffle abuse.) Mostly,
though, it's about Sobin's carefully crafted sensuous prose, which
is wonderful, if you like that sort of thing. If you don't, a
little goes a long way.

`MUSE' BRILLIANT BROOKS; `WINSLOW BOY' TOP MAMET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Muse'' (DVD) _ Albert Brooks can't seem to
catch a break. Perhaps his sense of irony and humiliation will
never cross over into the mainstream, but his loyal fans can enjoy,
again, his brilliant, comic assessment of Hollywood. The cameos by
Rob Reiner and Martin Scorsese are excellent, and Jeff Bridges is
perfectly cast as a tennis-playing screenwriter who can't get the
ball over the net but his self-image is so secure, he doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' (DVD) _ This might be David Mamet's best
movie. His adaptation of Terence Rattigan's 1946 play based on a
1910 legal case is convincingly compact. Mamet's understated style
perfectly suits the Victorian-era story of a young boy on trial for
stealing a five-shilling postal order. Rebecca Pidgeon superbly
underplays her role as a feminist, and Nigel Hawthorne is terrific
as the family patriarch. Cinematographer Benoit Delhomme's imagery
is perfectly married to the visual style of the period. Ariculate,
smart, suspenseful, and artfully unpretentious.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ! 1/2 ``The Beach'' It must have seemed a cool idea to Leonardo
DiCaprio to make a neo-hippie movie with the ``Trainspotting''
gang. But his blissed-out backpacker seems a twit without
qualities, redeeming or otherwise. He leaves everything and
everybody worse off and throws to the winds any chance of dramatic
credibility when he does a Marlon Brando ``Apocalypse Now'' parody
in the jungle. ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' did it better than this
candidate for all-time spring-break-bummer movie. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !! ``The Big Tease'' Sunny but slight mockumentary in which a
Scots hairdresser (Chris Ferguson) throws himself at the LA styling
establishment so he can make his mark in its Big Hair Olympics.
Easy to take, but innocuous. The best thing in it is Frances
Fisher, as a public relations live wire who's charmed out of a bad
hair day and decides to help plug the newcomer into the system.
(R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Following'' Christopher Nolan's ambitious film noir imagines a
naive unemployed writer (Jeremy Theobold) who begins trailing
ordinary people out of boredom and curiosity. Alex Haw delivers a
memorable performance as the burglar who catches Theobold at his
game, and begins to follow the follower. But Theobold can't keep
up, and the movie can't overcome its low-budget limitations.
(Unrated) (Michael Blowen) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Holy Smoke'' This throwback to Jane Campion's
``Sweetie'' and ``The Piano'' begins in an exciting burst of raw,
anarchic energy. It's carried by Kate Winslet's thrillingly
fearless performance as an Australian looking for something more
spiritual than her stifling family. But the film goes off the
tracks when she's brought back from India and thrown together with
a cult deprogrammer played by Harvey Keitel. It stops being about
her search and her risk-taking and starts being about his shaky ego
as they plunge into a mundane battle of the sexes. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``Snow Day'' The snow seems like plastic. The movie, too.
It's labored and prefab in its overextended story of preteens who
try to bring about a second snow day by diverting the working stiff
who runs the city's only snowplow, and of teens who chase young
love through the white stuff. Nice understated performance by Chevy
Chase as the loser weatherman dad of the protagonists, but there's
only so much he can do. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``The Tigger Movie'' The least endearing of all the ``Winnie the
Pooh'' characters gets his own animated kid-friendly feature. The
familiar bundle of unchecked impulse sets off on a search for his
kin. There's no arguing with the underlying message of ``home is
where the heart is,'' but more than half the film is spent in
rushed sketches and bewilderingly brief scenes accompanied by rote
songs. (G) (Joan Anderman)

CRACKING THE CITADEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
IN GLORY'S SHADOW 
Shannon Faulkner, The Citadel, and a Changing America 
By Catherine S. Manegold. Knopf. 352 pp. $26.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1993, perhaps on a whim, high school senior Shannon Faulkner
of Powdersville, S.C., applied to the all-male, state-supported
Citadel College. With the help of a guidance counselor and a little
White-out, Faulkner eliminated all mention of her gender in the
college application and her high school transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Unknowing Citadel officials sent Faulkner a letter of acceptance
that triggered an ugly, nearly three-year legal battle to allow her
to attend the school and march in the corps of cadets, which
Faulkner finally did briefly in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   All of that should be fodder for an interesting magazine article
and maybe a good book. But the problem with Catherine Manegold's
treatise, ``In Glory's Shadow: Shannon Faulkner, The Citadel and a
Changing America,'' is that the heroine is no Susan B. Anthony. Nor
is she very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   So Manegold, instead of writing about Faulkner and what she went
through to get into the school, turns this tale into a sweeping
history of the South, its military culture, and the men who led the
Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the story is no match for the way a similar
technique was used by Robert Timberg in ``The Nightingale's Song,''
the seminal work about five US Naval Academy graduates whose lives
intersected during Ronald Reagan's presidency and the Iran-Contra
scandal. Neither does it live up to the likes of Richard Ben
Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the ultimate account of six men running
for president in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed Faulkner in Powdersville for the Globe not long
after the Citadel realized it had mistakenly admitted a female to
the historically all-male school. Faulkner appeared awkward and
rather inarticulate, a simple teenager who never anticipated the
uproar her prank would spark.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she had applied to the Citadel, Faulkner had
difficulty answering. When asked why she thought the Citadel should
include men and women in its bachelor's program, she was similarly
unresponsive. Her mother, on the other hand, was brimming with
enthusiasm for the coverage the story prompted.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Manegold's story recounts, the excitement of all that
attention turned quickly to fear for the Faulkners.
</P>
<P>
   There were anonymous, threatening letters. Hostile phone calls
bombarded the family. Bumper stickers proclaimed ``Save the
males.'' And then, as Faulkner gained weight, other bumper stickers
said ``Shave the whale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brigadier, the campus newspaper, speculated on her
sexuality, suggesting she was a lesbian and then contending she was
romantically involved with a black cadet. Company marching chants
used lyrics that talked about electrocuting her. She was also
referred to as ``the divine bovine.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, a few days before Faulkner left Powdersville, a man
came up behind her in the grocery store, Faulkner said, putting his
hand over her mouth. He said, ``I can't touch you while you're on
that campus. But I can get to your parents. I know a place where I
can watch them burn.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy and exhausting legal battle that went all the
way to the US Supreme Court and cost the Citadel $10 million, the
gates opened, and Faulkner was allowed on campus as a cadet. She
had her own room, a private bathroom, and protection from federal
marshals.
</P>
<P>
   And then, Faulkner remembers hearing the voice of the man from
the grocery store again: ``The heat in Charleston makes some folks
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   She never figured out who said it. But that incident may have
been the point at which Faulkner's will to fight the forces arrayed
against her faltered, according to Manegold. She didn't even last a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner spent most of her five days in the infirmary, suffering
from heat exhaustion and stress. Eventually, she decided to leave
and the men on campus exulted, singing, ``Hey, hey, the witch is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Faulkner told her supporters. ``All I can say is
I have to think about my own health right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women cadets have since followed her, the first graduating
last year. As for Faulkner, she finally graduated herself last year
from Anderson College, 200 miles away.

THREE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS FEATURE BELIEVABLE YOUNG PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the life of your average preteen or teenage kid were a TV
show, there would be no shortage of storylines.
</P>
<P>
   There's first love, of course, often followed by first
heartbreak. School corridors are filled with rival cliques that
carry on like Montagues and Capulets, and daily life is charged by
collisions with parents and other authority figures. On a regular
basis, kids taste the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat on
the soccer field, in the classroom, or on the dance floor. All of
this, of course, occurring in a context of excruciating
self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In short, puberty and adolescence furnish no end of raw material
for drama, not to mention awkward slapstick moments of comedy (that
are not usually a laughing matter at the time). Oddly enough,
though, television has historically shown only sporadic interest in
the dramatic and even comedic possibilities of those turbulent
years, largely relegating preteens and teenagers to supporting
roles in family programs.
</P>
<P>
   This season, though, kids occupy center stage in two of the best
new shows on television: NBC's ``Freaks and Geeks'' and Fox's
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' and are playing an increasingly
prominent role in another new gem, ABC's ``Onceand Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, the three programs don't have much in common.
``Malcolm in the Middle'' is a gonzo comedy, ``Once and Again'' is
an introspective relationship drama, and ``Freaks and Geeks'' is a
quirky hybrid of sitcom humor and emotional poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   But what the three share is a gallery of richly individual
portraits of believable kids _ unlike, say, the miniature adults
who inhabit teen soap operas such as ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and
``Dawson's Creek,'' or the superwoman fantasy of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' _ and an honest effort to look at an
often-confusing world from a youthful point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Not so incidentally, all three programs feature some of the most
talented and appealing young stars to light up the small screen
since the mid-1990s heyday with the likes of Fred Savage (``The
Wonder Years'') and Claire Danes (``My So-Called Life'').
</P>
<P>
   One of them is 14-year-old John Daley, who plays geeky but
soulful high school freshman Sam Weir in ``Freaks and Geeks.'' In a
telephone interview, Daley said the strength of the program is that
``we cover a lot of the topics you'll find in a high school, and we
talk like kids, not adults, in the way things are expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dealing with birth-control problems; we're dealing
with bully problems,'' said Daley.
</P>
<P>
   To 10-year-old Meredith Deane, who plays Zoe Manning on ``Once
and Again,'' it's only logical that stories spotlighting the
younger characters have begun cropping up more and more in what
began as a show about middle-aged love. After all, Deane said, in
her age group ``there's so many things going on. There's the
transfer to middle school. There's divorce. There's all kinds of
preteen issues for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Muniz, the 14-year-old actor who plays the title
character, a child genius, of ``Malcolm in the Middle,''
emphatically believes that his and other current shows are ``more
real'' depictions of childhood and adolescence than the standard TV
fare of ``perfect families singing carols to their grandma in front
of the Christmas tree.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking back and ahead
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the creators of the three new shows _ baby
boomers all _ said they were drawn partly by the opportunity to
portray youngsters more realistically, and partly by the chance to
create stories that comment on their own youth or on the lives of
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Feig, the 37-year-old creator of ``Freaks and Geeks,''
acknowledged that he modeled the character of Sam on himself. But
he also draws freely from the young cast. ``Half the time I'll be
hanging around on the set, listening to the kids,'' he said. ``They
tell me `I'm afraid to say or do anything because it will end up in
the script.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sam has a crush on an unattainable girl _ a crush that Neal, one
of Sam's fellow geeks, advises him to drop. ``She's a
cheerleader,'' he explains. ``You've seen `Star Wars' 27 times. Do
the math.''
</P>
<P>
   In another episode, the ``freaks'' are so desperate to get into
a bar to see a hot rock band that they purchase fake IDs from a
scary ex-con. Meanwhile, the ``geeks'' befriend a pretty new girl
in school and are giddy that she wants to spend time with them,
only to see her slowly but surely abandon them for the company of
the jocks and cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, adolescence. ``It's a time when your emotions are at their
highest _ and your worldview is at its most narrow _ and it's
excusable,'' remarked Feig. ``It's much easier for me to summon up
the feelings I had then than it is to write about grown-up
feelings. I write about things that were terrible at the time, but
can be funny now.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach is taken by Linwood Boomer, creator of
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' a midseason show that has exploded into
a top-10 hit. Like the title character, Boomer was labeled
``gifted'' as a child, which led to ``one of the truly worst times
in my life, not funny at all at the time. But if you think about
most comedies, it wouldn't be funny happening to a real person.''
</P>
<P>
   From his childhood travail, the now-43-year-old Boomer has drawn
the material for an uproariously funny comedy. Malcolm is ashamed
of his 165 IQ and wants nothing more than to be a regular kid, but
no such luck. A teacher solicitously spells it out to the rest of
his class: ``Malcolm may not look different than the rest of us,
but he is. Verydifferent . . . in his brain.'' At a science fair
where Malcolm does a dazzling series of computations involving
numbers from credit cards, one classmate sighs: ``Following you is
like following Streisand.'' His normally voluble family is stunned
into silence by Malcolm's brilliance. ``Is Malcolm a robot?'' asks
his kid brother.
</P>
<P>
   Boomer said adolescence is fertile terrain for comedy or drama
because it's ``that time when you've got all the physical powers of
an adult, and none of the common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fork in the road
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That duality can lead to pratfalls, as in ``Malcolm,'' or it can
lead to intense soul-searching. That's where Edward Zwick comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Zwick, along with fellow ``thirtysomething'' creator Marshall
Herskovitz, helped pioneer the teen-angst genre with ``My So-Called
Life'' in 1994. The program made a star out of Claire Danes, who
played 15-year-old Angela Chase, and legitimized teenage life as
the stuff of serious drama, with plots involving guns in school,
the harassment of a gay student, and Angela's sexual awakening.
</P>
<P>
   But ``My So-Called Life'' lasted only half a season before being
canceled. So when Zwick and Herskovitz began writing ``Once and
Again,'' a drama about the romance between two divorcees, they knew
from the start that the program would place increasing emphasis on
14-year-old Grace and 9-year-old Zoe Manning, the daughters of Lily
Manning, and on Rick Sammler's two children, 16-year-old Eli and
12-year-old Jessie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt there was still a lot more to say,'' said Zwick, 47.
``To be the parents of older children, as both Marshall and I are,
and to spend a disproportionate amount of time thinking and talking
about that: We wanted to write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, adolescence is a universal experience with
which viewers can identify. ``In every life, not only in a writer's
life, those years have a kind of lasting resonance,'' he said.
``Witness the number of people who evoke high school as the seminal
moment, even sometimes the defining moment, of their lives. It's a
time when everything is amplified: your passions, your fears,
connections, alienation. You're in a kind of hormonally induced
hallucination.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks on ``Once and Again,'' little Zoe learned that
her parents were getting a divorce on Christmas Eve at the same
moment she made another devastating discovery. Virtually an entire
episode was devoted to Eli's attempts (ultimately unsuccessful) to
find a sensitive way to break up with his girlfriend. On numerous
episodes, the children's uncertainty and tentativeness is matched
and mirrored by their parents' own faltering attempts at romance: a
subtle reminder that in some ways, we all remain teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as these shows are, they won't survive long without
an audience. For instance, ratings are ominously (and inexplicably)
low for the irresistible ``Freaks and Geeks''; it currently ranks
103d out of 154 shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers loved `My So-Called Life,' but it could not draw
older viewers,'' observed Alex McNeil, the author of ``Total
Television.'' ``You have to have another segment of the viewing
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Nielsen has in store for them in the long term, the
fact that ``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' and
``Once and Again'' are on the air is heartening to Robert J.
Thompson, author of ``Television's Second Golden Age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These blue-chip creators have finally begun to realize that
this is a great place to tell American stories,'' said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing it took television so long to figure out we
shouldn't be doing just cop shows or hospital shows or detective
shows,'' he added. ``The clash between generations in the year
2000: I can think of few stories that are more interesting, more
potentially dramatic, and more universal than these stories.''

TATE GALLERY, NEW BRANCH RADIATE ENERGY OF A MODERN MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Christoph Grunenberg was rather ungraciously forced out
of his position as curator of Boston's Institute of Contemporary
Art last year. After a couple of figurative somersaults, he landed
quite gracefully on two feet, at the Tate Gallery, where, since
September, he's been curator of contemporary collections.
</P>
<P>
   He's moved from farm team to the major leagues. The ICA
currently has 13 full-time employees, a schedule of half a dozen
shows a year, annual attendance of 75,000, and a plan (which some
knowledgeable observers feel is iffy) to build a new waterfront
facility. The Tate staff is 500 strong; the main museum at Millbank
in London's Westminster mounts a half-dozen shows at any one time,
along with jaw-dropping displays of the permanent collections.
Millbank attendance is 2.4 million annually, with another million
visiting the museum's branches in Liverpool and St. Ives, and more
than two million more expected to visit the new Tate Modern, which
will open in May in the former Bankside Power Station on the South
side of the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   Millbank, now undergoing its own dramatic expansion, will house
the museum's collection of British art, 1500 to the present; the
Tate Modern will present Britain's national collection of
international modern and contemporary art, plus a menu of temporary
shows. A shuttle boat on the Thames will ferry visitors the mile
and a half from one Tate to the other _ not a perfect solution, but
there wasn't an eligible site or structure any nearer to Millbank.
Harvard, which hopes to build a new Renzo Piano-designed museum in
Cambridge, Mass., will doubtless keep a close eye on how the double
venue works out for the Tate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tate's ambition is to be one of the top three or four
modern museums in the world,'' says Grunenberg, sitting in his
spacious corner office located in a historic building adjacent to
the Millbank museum, which is bursting at the seams. ``It's not as
big a collection as the Museum of Modern Art's or the Guggenheim's.
But the only modern art museum in competition with it in Europe is
the Centre Pompidou'' in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   German by birth, Grunenberg, 37, is no stranger to London,
having trained at the city's famed Courtauld Institute, where the
Tate's dynamo director, Nicholas Serota, also studied. Grunenberg's
special subjects were the American painter Mark Rothko and the
history of the white cube as the classic setting for 20th-century
art. At the Tate, he revisits both. He'll be in charge of
installing the series of nine magisterial burgundy and black
Rothkos the artist gave to the Tate after deciding that their
intended setting, the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram
Building in New York, wasn't sufficiently spiritual. One room at
the Tate Modern will be designed around them, and the BBC is doing
a special solely on the Rothkos _ which arrived at the Tate the
very day the artist committed suicide, in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Grunenberg's brief Boston career? He was hired
by former director Milena Kalinovska, whose replacement, current
director Jill Medvedow, ``has a serious lack of affinity for
contemporary culture,'' Grunenberg says. ``She didn't support my
commitment to international programming and to an interchange with
contemporary popular culture.'' She also brought in another
curator, Jessica Morgan, in effect shunting him aside. It was clear
that Grunenberg and Medvedow couldn't work together. (Medvedow
declined to comment on Grunenberg for this story.) He applied for
other Boston curatorial vacancies. Then the call came from the
Tate.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two institutions are extreme. ``At a
small institution like the ICA there's an improvisational, hectic
pace,'' he says. ``You can't do things thoroughly. You just get the
show up on the walls. Here, the schedule is planned three to four
years ahead of time and there are archives, libraries, and
conservation and publications departments to back up curators.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunenberg is in the Tate's collections department, which means
he's in charge of the contemporary part of the permanent collection
_ maintaining and installing it, as well as adding to it, both by
shopping and through the bequests in lieu of inheritance taxes that
British law allows. The Tate recently acquired a Brancusi and
Mondrian through the bequest law. The Tate's collections are its
collateral, and make getting loans from sister museums fairly
simple. ``Because the ICA doesn't collect and has nothing to offer
in exchange,'' Grunenberg says, ``getting loans there is a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the Tate generates excitement over new
art in a way Grunenberg's former employer never has been able to.
The Rachel Whiteread show he organized, one of the finest the ICA
has ever presented, attracted a scant 3,000 visitors. His 1997
``Gothic'' show, a complex meditation on the macabre, drew only
6,000, despite its obvious appeal to youthful followers of ``Goth''
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Tate has no such attendance problems for new art, especially
around the time of the annual Turner Prize show, which draws well
over 100,000 visitors a year and is reliably controversial. The
winner of the $32,000 award _ this year, it's 30-year-old filmmaker
Steve McQueen _ _ is announced, Academy Awards-style, on live TV.
``There was one week during this year's show of the short-listed
artists when you couldn't turn on the television without hearing
about it,'' says Grunenberg, who is about to take over the Tate's
Patrons of New Art, the group that started the Prize in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   It was the unmade panty-hose-strewn bed at the heart of Tracey
Emin's installation that sent viewers over the edge at this year's
show, which closed last week. Maybe it offended the British love of
tidiness? Grunenberg doesn't think it was the implication of sex.
The British public, he says, doesn't get riled up over sexual art.
</P>
<P>
   Britons thought the American reaction to ``Sensation!,'' the
show of work by young British artists that caused the mayor of New
York to threaten to close down the Brooklyn Museum, ``was
typical,'' Grunenberg says. ``It reinforced the stereotype about
American puritanism. It was very telling that the fuss was over
religion'' _ over Chris Ofili's painting of the Virgin with knobs
of dung affixed to it. ``That's a shift in the culture wars. It
used to be sex that caused controversy in America. Now you can show
work that is actually obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tate, partly through Serota's vigorous efforts, has
developed the kind of global constituency an institution such as
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, perceived as ``regional,'' can only
envy _ and will have to develop to carry out its own ambitious
expansion plans. The Tate's International Council includes 100 top
collectors, ``the creme de la creme,'' Grunenberg calls them,
including a number of Americans. (No members from Boston yet.)
</P>
<P>
   When he left London in 1993, ``it was still a hostile place for
contemporary art,'' Grunenberg recalls. ``It's changed enormously,
with loads of new galleries and much more serious arts coverage in
the press, which used to be notably philistine.''

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The unseemly fight George Bush and
John McCain in South Carolina is a battle of images rather than
issues. But they are both so frantic that their efforts to distort
each other's identity are often downright silly. McCain is not a
loony liberal, as Bush contended, and Bush is not Bill Clinton, as
McCain claimed. McCain was wise to pull away from such madness.
Bush ought to do the same. By MARIANNE MEANS.

FOR THE RECORD, THIS GUY IS CRAZY ABOUT FITNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Sokol calls himself the fittest man alive. He'd have to
be. Can you do that?
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old San Jose fitness freak has set nearly 20
unheard-of exercise records. Such as: 52,003 sit-ups in 32 hours
and 17 minutes; 3,333 squat thrusts in four hours; and 500.2 miles
bicycled _ standing up.
</P>
<P>
   Sokol was in the area recently, trying to shatter two
squat-thrust records. He explained his overzealous need to keep
breaking exercise records and maintain a healthy and fit body.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you're setting all these records because ... ?
</P>
<P>
   A: The reasons have changed. At first, it was to be the best at
something. It was a matter of finding something I could excel at,
to satisfy my own ego. Then it became entwined in my career.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you do have a life beyond this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah, I have a master's in exercise physiology and an
undergraduate bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. I have
been teaching and working in health clubs and I do a lot of
speaking at Silicon Valley companies. I hold several patents on
exercise equipment. I've made a little career out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, I get to continue testing myself. I feel like I'm holding
the clock back, like I'm young physically. Some people think, ``I
can't do certain things anymore,'' and I don't think that's true,
not only in exercise, but in all facets of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you're setting records, when do you have time to, like,
go to the bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Guinness, if an event goes longer than 12 hours, you're
allotted a five-minute break each hour. But you can't accumulate
them. And you can't sleep, so that five minutes is important.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does your wife think you're nuts?
</P>
<P>
   A: I met her as a result of her seeing an article on me in
Cosmpolitan, so she knew what she was getting into. She's a dancer
and she teaches health and fitness to children, so she's very
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kinda food do you eat?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lots of fruits and vegetables. I drink a lot of water and try
to stay with leaner protein foods. I do take supplements. I'm not
as sore after my workouts. I also take your basic multivitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ever fall off the wagon and make it a Whataburger night?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't eat hamburgers, but I had Mexican food. I won't get
chips and cheese or foods with lots of fat. If I go to an Italian
restaurant, I ask them to keep oil off the salad and put on my own
dressing. It does require making certain choices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hear you also know a lot about stress reduction. Let's say
I have two girlfriends, making my life very hectic. Any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you can switch to one girlfriend. The other possibility
is to commute from one residence to the next on bike or foot. Try
to incorporate exercise into your everyday life. You might
incorporate other things too, but I won't go there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Answer a long debate _ what's better, treadmill or
StairMaster?
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither. The best exercise is what you like to do. Walking is
generally the most convenient form of exercise. It requires very
little learning, with the exception of my 13-month-old son, who's
not quite getting it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's say I don't have any weights (and believe me, I don't),
what else can I use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every object in your house can become exercise equipment. I
spend a lot of time in hotels, so I've learned how to use hotel
furniture. With a chair and a bed, you can put your feet up on the
bed and hands on the chair, as if you're sitting. Your palms rest
on the chair, your backside hangs off the chair. Bend your elbows
and your rear drops down. That works your triceps. You can turn
over and do an interesting-looking push-up with your hands on the
armrests of the chair. Or you can pull milk jugs out of the fridge
and do arm curls and overhead presses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get started doing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I started exercising when I was young. I had asthma. A family
physician who was ahead of her time recommended swimming.
Eventually, I outgrew the asthma and acquired a love of exercise. I
ran track and played water polo and competed in events. When I got
out of college, I didn't have my competitive outlet anymore, so I
started running marathons and competing in bike-riding events. I
found out that by some quirky circumstance, I was very good at
sit-ups. At that point, it was like the cartoon character with the
light bulb going on above his head. Now it's a curse I have to live
with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When are you going to quit?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'll never stop exercising. I will stop record-setting when
there's nothing left that I can pull off. I'm not perfect, but I am
healthy and that's something I enjoy. Five years from now, of
course, I'll have this big ol' fat beer belly.

&HT;     BUDGET CUTS PUT ART IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CIRET FISCHER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I recently was invited to the Kennedy Center in
Washington D.C. to receive an award from the Fund for New American
Plays for ``See Under: Love,'' a play I adapted from a novel by the
same name by David Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has been struggling in the trenches of
non-commercial theater for over 25 years, the call from Washington
was heady stuff, and I felt extremely grateful for the recognition.
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington, I paid a visit to another institution to
which I feel an enormous debt of gratitude: the National Endowment
for the Arts. A Traveling Jewish Theatre _ the nonprofit theater I
helped found and still co-direct _ would probably not have survived
for over two decades had it not been funded in its formative years
by the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   When I stepped out of the wrought-iron elevator on the seventh
floor of the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, I was
confronted with tangible evidence of what it means to be on the
front lines of the so-called culture wars.
</P>
<P>
   File cabinets and conference tables line the hallways. Piles of
records, grant applications and videotapes are stacked wherever
there's an inch of space.
</P>
<P>
   The office quarters have been reduced by more than one third of
the already modest size they'd reached in ``the good years.'' When
I met with staff members, we sat on a well-worn sofa and chair
squeezed between several cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   One key program officer couldn't join the meeting because of the
enormous work load she's carrying. In addition to space, the
National Endowment for the Arts lost more than one-third of its
staff and nearly half its budget when it became a political
football between 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The good people of the NEA, like residents of a besieged city,
do what they can to maintain a sense of normality. They screen
applications, organize site visits, develop new initiatives, meet
with artists and members of Congress. And, yet, I leave convinced
that the situation is anything but normal.
</P>
<P>
   It is not normal for the leaders of a great democracy to turn
against one of the most basic human impulses: the creation of art.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, all societies that have done so have been equally
hostile to any expression of human freedom. This animus toward art
is often couched in the argument that in the absence of government
support, the market will best determine what kind of art should be
nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the market supports art that is marketable. Such art
may be of high quality. It may satisfy our needs for entertainment
or diversion. But art-as-product rarely provokes, challenges or
innovates.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, when public support for the arts was generous and
broad, artists created a body of work that became part of America's
deep cultural memory: the photos of Dorothea Lange, the songs of
Woody Guthrie, the theater of John Houseman and Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, government support, through the newly
created NEA, helped support a vital legacy in the form of
institutions like the Lincoln Center, the Guthrie Theater, the
Public Theater, scores of museums, creative writing programs and a
national network of neighborhood arts programs, resident theaters,
symphonies and dance companies.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat among the cubicles and the overflowing files at the
NEA, I began to fear for that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the theater and other unmarketable art forms will
persevere, one way or another. The need to create simply runs too
deep to be extinguished by budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, walking back through the overcrowded hallway, I wondered at
all the dreams and hard work that lay buried in the piles of grant
applications stacked along the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that these nascent theaters, dance companies and
musical groups will still exist 20 years from now are all too slim
as long as our cultural future continues to be held hostage by
politics.

   SOUTHASIA-RIGHTS (United Nations) _ Human rights organizations

declared a terrorist state _ when India has been involved in
fomenting insurrections in the region for decades and has one of
the worst human rights records of any democracy. By Barbara

   DRY-CLEANERS (Undated) _ For more than a decade, the dry
cleaning business has looked like a tantalizing opportunity for
environmentally minded entrepreneurs. Despite increasing
regulations not to mention criticism from groups like Greenpeace
and Consumers Union, a vast majority of the nation's roughly 33,000
dry cleaners persist in using toxic chemicals linked to cancer,
nervous system ailments and other health hazards. ``Green
cleaners'' using water and new biodegradable detergents sprang up
in many communities in the 1990s. But few existing dry cleaners
were inclined to switch because ``wet cleaning'' takes longer,
increases labor costs and can easily lead to shrinkage or other
quality problems. Now the green spotlight is being claimed by
Hangers Cleaners, which is trying to sell the industry and its
customers on a radically different technology. A look at the
hurdles Hangers has encountered underscores how constant
improvements in existing technology and numerous other competitive
wrinkles can slow environmental innovation, even in industries that
look simple to outsiders. By Barnaby J. Feder.

&HT;     LOIS IS VERY POPULAR AT THIS CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By IHOSVANI RODRIGUES  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Alyssa is popular. So are Jacob, Maria, Joshua,
Austin, Hunter, Antonio, Hannah, Jared, Mackenzie, Marisa, Dakota,
Alejandro, Zach, Jose, Ashley, Madison and Cristina.
</P>
<P>
   Lois, however, is a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the names above, Lois failed to make the Social Security
Administration's top 100 names for births in 1999. Lois never came
close, not even in the top 385.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the name Lois made it onto any list of popular
baby names was in the 1930s, when it ranked an admirable 18th.
Ethel, Margaret and Harold also were on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, San Antonio may have the largest
concentration of women named Lois in the world. About 150 people
named Lois _ each a proud member of the National Lois Club _ are
expected to attend the group's annual convention here.
</P>
<P>
   As in most years, Lois conventioneers will have no real order of
business or itinerary except hanging out with others bearing the
same name. There is not even a profound reason why they chose San
Antonio. (There are no local chapters or members in the entire
state of Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a daughter in San Antonio, so I thought we should go
down there and visit,'' said Lois Rightor, a convention organizer
from Columbus, Ohio. ``I heard it's really pretty down there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a traditional joke for someone to walk into our
meeting room and yell out `Phone call for Lois,''' Rightor said.
</P>
<P>
   The group of Loises has met biennially since 1979, once going as
far as Ireland. What is different about the San Antonio convention
is that it will be the first time the group has met two years
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   The name of Lois is a dying name, they explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned a cruise last year, but by the time we planned it
and actually had it, three members had died,'' Rightor said.
``We've since decided we'll have the convention every year instead
of every two years.''
</P>
<P>
   To help promote the name and everything Lois, there is a Lois
Club in 20 U.S. states, Canada, Norway, Australia, the United
Kingdom and New Zealand. There is a competing organization, the
Lois Link, mostly active in Canada and California.
</P>
<P>
   The upper Midwest is huge Lois country. The biggest clubs are in
Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Milwaukee club has more than 300
members, including a man named Lois _ the only known male in a Lois
Club.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>

   STORMS-GEORGIA _ CAMILLA, Ga. _ Tornadoes slashed through
southwest Georgia early today, killing at least 12 people and
injuring more than 100. The Mitchell County town of Camilla
appeared to be hardest hit, with tornadoes cutting a 5-mile path
through a housing development south of town. (Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   STORMS-SOUTH _ The killer tornadoes that struck Georgia early
Monday grew out of a line of thunderstorms that swept across the
South during the night and by morning extended all along the East
Coast. Thunderstorms also ripped off roofs and knocked down trees
in parts of Alabama, and earlier strong wind destroyed at least six
houses in Arkansas and injured two people. Trees and power lines
also were down in parts of Mississippi and Tennessee, where one
woman was injured by wind-blown debris. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   STORMS-MOBILEHOMES _ Mobile home storm safety. Does Georgia
require tiedowns, as some states do? If not, why not? What lessons
from other states? Are there any tips for surviving in a mobile
home except to leave? And if you leave, where can you go? (Davis,

   STORMS-WARNING _ How much warning did hard-hit areas have? The
National Weather Service had the area under at least a tornado
watch earlier. Are there sirens? Does NWS weather alert radio
system cover these areas? A state commission was formed after '98
tornadoes and grants are being made now for sirens and weather
radios. Any of this in the hit areas? (Harvey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.

   FILM-RIBISI-FEATURE _ The sleepy-eyed Giovanni Ribisi is wide

already been a crack medic in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a
parenthood-obsessed brother to Phoebe in ``Friends,'' and a
mentally challenged man in ``The Other Sister.'' We can almost

 &HT;    `You don't own a house like this... you get to live in it a
while and then pass it on.'
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ John and Kay Ziegler made Lucindia their
permanent home in 1997, almost three-quarters of a century from the
time William Carnegie _ nephew of steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie _
built the house on a 35-foot rise above the St. Lucie River in
1924.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Zieglers are only the home's sixth owners, they
view their time at Lucindia this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't own a house like this,'' says John Ziegler. ``You're
a trustee and you get to live in it awhile and then pass it on,
hopefully, to someone who'll appreciate the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   And a grand tradition it is.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, their home was the crowning jewel of 50 acres of
prime Sewall's Point land that stretched from the St. Lucie River
to the Indian River (hence the name Lucindia, a hybrid of the
rivers' names). During the property's early years, William and
Alice Carnegie added 10-acre parcels here and there until they had
fashioned a grand estate, complete with a packinghouse, boathouse,
guest and caretakers' houses, a greenhouse, pool and poolhouse.
There was even a windmill.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing their own quarters was a little more complicated. Soon
after the Carnegies bought the first acres of land in 1923, they
built a grand, formal mansion. Almost immediately afterward, they
fell in love with what was to become known historically as
``Mizner-style'': Mediterranean-like stucco homes with barrel-tile
roofs, pecky cypress woodwork and wrought-iron hardware designed by
famed Palm Beacher Addison Mizner.
</P>
<P>
   So the Carnegies tore down their first home and commissioned
architect Jack Yates to design a new one. Yates included many
Mizneresque touches, from exposed pecky cypress ceiling beams to
odd-shaped windows and doors. All of the wrought ironwork in the
house was made in Mizner's own factory.
</P>
<P>
   Although subdivision of the estate began in the 1960s (Lucindia
is now a 3-acre parcel), that ironwork has survived, from sconces
and chandeliers to hinges and gates. So have the cypress beams of
the living room, the oak floors and a 40-foot gumbo limbo tree in
the back yard _ rare to see at that size.
</P>
<P>
   The Zieglers credit longtime Lucindia residents Marjorie and Bud
Jordan _ well-known champions of the St. Lucie River's fragile
ecosystem _ with maintaining the home's character while improving
its use. The Jordans lived in the home for nearly 20 years, just
prior to the man who sold it to the Zieglers after a brief stay.
They added a two-story, glassed-in sun porch that floods the
original living room with light. They turned two small, separate
kitchens into one big one with a built-in breakfast nook and a view
of the river, an ideal renovation for John Ziegler, who loves to
cook. And they turned two bedrooms into a master suite with a
whirlpool tub that overlooks the river.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lucindia has become a tranquil retreat for the
Zieglers, who also maintain homes in New York, Michigan and London.
John Ziegler, president of the National Hockey League from 1977 to
1992, is semi-retired, but still works as a sports business
consultant. But he finds it harder and harder _ especially at this
time of year _ to visit his office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised by (this) lifestyle, in terms of the
tempo, coupled with the weather,'' he says. Lucindia allows him _
maybe even forces him _ to slow down and relax, slip on boat shoes
and putter around the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Lucindia also works its magic on Kay, an antiques appraiser who
spent 11 years as a flight attendant for Pan Am's presidential
charters. She worked on airplanes that ferried White House staff,
the Secret Service and press corps, a demanding job that took her
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   At Lucindia, life is quieter. She tends to roses beside the pool
and plays with the King Charles spaniels she breeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up here in the morning,'' she says, ``And you just
feel good.''

ON THE WEB, MAGAZINE IS ALL THE BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buzz snakes through our culture like millennial mist. People and
institutions rise and fall on their ability to generate the stuff.
For more than a decade, Tina Brown was the fin de siecle queen of
buzz. As editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she and her
publications dominated table talk at All The Right Places.
</P>
<P>
   But today Brown is in eclipse. The latest pretender to her
throne is David Talbot, creator of Salon.com, the randy, San
Francisco-based online magazine. Talbot's house of buzz has cooked
up a daily gumbo of news and opinion, arguably hotter than anything
on the Internet. Anchored by outstanding cultural coverage, it
presents a sexed, edgy confection that attracts readers like moths
to a back porch light.
</P>
<P>
   And it has done so in cyberspace, not on the newsstand. ``Salon
is the first really successful new media site on the Net,'' says
media critic Jon Katz. ``It is the first to figure out how to fuse
content and interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Its craving for attention is matched by its penchant for
controversy. Salon is in the news for its lapses in judgment as
well as its scoops. Its writing, says Washington Post media critic
Howard Kurtz, ranges from superb to sophomoric. The editorial
product can be as uneven as it is insouciant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this unhinged approach has legs is unclear. ``Salon's
strength and weakness is that it takes all kinds of editorial
chances in an age when most publications are cautious and overly
polite,'' Kurtz says.
</P>
<P>
   When Salon is good, it is very good. Salon reporter Daniel
Forbes made headlines last month when he uncorked a story
documenting the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy's searching of network television scripts for antidrug
messages. It was a superior piece of journalism and a clean score
for Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Talbot ran a piece by Dan Savage, an
openly gay Seattle-based writer bent on giving then-presidential
candidate Gary Bauer the flu because of Bauer's antipathy toward
gays. Savage, who had come down with the virus, posed as a Bauer
volunteer in Iowa and fraudulently voted as a Republican there.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers howled about the piece, which they considered
beyond the pale even for Salon. Talbot printed a sampling of their
e-mail tirades along with an editor's note in which he stood by the
article without condoning what Savage claimed to have done. Today,
Talbot remains unchastened by l'affaire Savage: ``My only
difficulty was not to have put an editor's note on the piece when
it ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon, then, is the gifted adolescent who dazzles a crowd yet
forgets to clean up his room. And it couldn't care less about
criticism. ``There is no bad buzz,'' says David Weir, its
Washington bureau chief, updating P.T. Barnum's famous dictum.
``We're not The New York Times. We're not gatekeepers of what
should be published.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Salon's sense of propriety is elastic, its
pursuit of cheek singleminded. ``The primary reason Salon exists is
because of the frustration I felt by the confines of daily
journalism,'' explains Talbot, a former arts editor of the San
Francisco Examiner. ``It has become increasingly formulaic and
focus-group driven _ simply dull. I came of age with the gonzo
journalism of Hunter Thompson in Rolling Stone. It was risk-taking,
provocative journalism. We've done that here.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about that. Salon is still recovering from the
firestorm it created in 1998 over the story it ran, on the eve of
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, about a
34-year-old extramarital affair of House Judiciary Committee
chairman Henry Hyde. All 57 journalistic organizations that were
offered the story turned it down. Salon's Washington correspondent,
Jonathan Broder, left over Talbot's decision to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot was pilloried for leaky ethics and a pro-Clinton agenda.
There were bomb threats at the office and death threats at home. He
wrote at the time that ``ugly times call for ugly tactics'' and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is also a feast of guilty pleasures. It produces stories
as illicit in this earnest world as Godiva chocolates to a weight
watcher. High in this category are the 53 episodes of ``Nancy Chan:
Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl.'' This fictional romp catches with
a gimlet eye the lust in the Imperial City with chapters like
``Thighs Wide Shut.'' Salon also has a regular sex column. One
recent offering by Susie Bright titled ``The Randy Bellboy''
provided tips on how lonely female hotel guests can get serviced by
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbot also craves serious credentials. Salon's political
reportage, notably its award-winning work on the Whitewater
scandal, has been solid. Last summer, Weir opened a Washington
bureau that will soon have nine reporters. (There are 56 on the
editorial staff, 10 in New York and the rest in San Francisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Jake Tapper, its lead political reporter, provides a steady
stream of smart, wry coverage of the presidential campaign. The day
after the New Hampshire primary, while the rest of the media herd
focused on South Carolina, Anthony York had a strong piece
detailing how the arcane rules in the California primaries will
hinder the transfer of raw votes among independents for John McCain
and Bill Bradley into convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, sex trumps politics at Salon.
Grown-up discussion of it is Salon's long suit and is marbled
through the 11 Salon sites, which include Arts &AMP; Entertainment,
Books, Health &AMP; Body, Media, News, Politics2000, and, Technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest is Mothers Who Think, edited by Talbot's
wife, Camille Peri, devoted to intelligent exploration of real life
for women with children. Two weeks ago, it ran a piece asking, ``Is
this child pornography?'' about the trend among photo labs to call
police over film of naked children in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot celebrates sex because no one else does. He considers it
an effective tool to distance Salon from online competitors. ``The
question for new media operations is: What do you do that no one
else does?'' he asks. ``Most publications in America can't answer
that effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But more fundamentally, Talbot chafes at the way sex is treated
in this country. ``The US is childish as a culture in dealing with
it,'' says Talbot, who wrote a book on the subject. ``It is treated
either in a snickering sophomoric way or a harrumphing prudish way.
I find that inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Weir, ``I can't think of a dinner party when sex doesn't
come up along with politics, books, and movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot started Salon in 1995 as a weekly cultural digest. Books
were its windows to the world. ``At the beginning, we concluded
that the focus on new ideas in arts and culture and politics tended
to emerge through books,'' Weir says. Salon's book section remains
a superior admixture of knowing reviews covering an eclectic range
of books and illuminating interviews with authors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Talbot realized that Salon could not survive as a
weekly given the speed of the Internet, and in February 1997 took
it daily. ``We realized that news drives traffic,'' Weir says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, news coverage mushroomed, driven by the elections
that year and seismic events like the death of Princess Diana that
drew huge spikes in readership. Talbot sees running room covering
the entertainment industry. Because publications like Entertainment
Weekly are owned by conglomerates, he argues, they will be less
likely to pursue aggressive investigations than the independent
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Salon had revenues of $6.2 million last year and expects to turn
a profit sometime next year. It raised $27 million in a public
offering and $15 million from private investors last year to pay
for its current hiring spree. But profits are elusive for dotcoms.
Buzz does not automatically morph into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot hopes to open a European operation based in London later
this year. CEO Michael O'Donnell is now in Europe talking to
institutional investors. He salivates over the $800 million worth
of online ads in the United Kingdom alone last year and remains
sanguine that an American operation can thrive in a cultural
collision with the Euros.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Salon sold 10 percent of itself last year
to Rainbow Media Holdings, the holding company for the Bravo
Network, the Independent Film Channel, and American Movie Classics.
It plans to air its own television show on Bravo in late summer.
Salon Radio, accessible on its home page, is also ramping up its
audio stream of talk and music to augment the online offerings. By
the end of the year, a reader will be able to hear Salon reporters,
reviewers, and columnists read their work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salon readership is soaring, according to its own
figures. It claims that 3.4 million people visited it in December,
up fivefold from the 650,000 during the previous December. Slate,
the more traditional online magazine of politics and commentary run
by former New Republic editor Michael Kinsley, disputes the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This food fight is based on dueling statistics. The industry
yardstick has been Media Metrix, the New York company that projects
totals based on a sample of users. By that measurement, Salon had
1.4 million in December; Slate had 900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salon says that the sample system grossly underestimates the
true numbers. As for Slate's charges? ``Sour grapes,'' says Patrick
Hurley, Salon's vice president for marketing. ``When's the last
time you heard someone talk about Slate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slate won't go around licking doorknobs,'' snaps Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   But it does advertise on Salon. Even more delicious for Salon
was CNN's refusal last year to air its television ad campaign on
the grounds that an online site was a direct competitor to the TV
network.
</P>
<P>
   Love that buzz. At the end of the day, though, Salon will rise
or fall on its credibility. ``Buzz is their ideology,'' Broder
says. ``Once the fascination in the Web ends, the old rules still
apply.''

W.R. GRACE CO. RESISTED ASBESTOS LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Attn.: Mont.; a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE APPEL AND NEIL SWIDEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   W. R. Grace Co. sold millions of bags of home attic insulation
that contained asbestos, but the company never warned the public,
documents obtained by The Boston Globe show.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Grace, whose Cambridge, Mass. Construction
Products Division oversaw Zonolite Attic Insulation until it was
discontinued in 1984, knew as far back as 1963 about the asbestos.
But they were worried that a warning label would hurt sales, memos
from high-ranking Grace officials show.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos has been linked to several diseases, including lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no labeling requirement at the time, Grace did
not break the law. But documents show the company lobbied hard to
keep its product free from warning labels and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In public testimony and letters to government regulators, Grace
executives consistently argued that the attic insulation was safe.
In internal memos, they:
</P>
<P>
   --Discussed such options for keeping regulators at bay as
``obstruct and block.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tracked mounting lung cancer deaths of workers at the Grace
mine and mill where the main ingredient used in the insulation came
from.
</P>
<P>
   --Drafted a press release in 1977, citing ``health hazards'' as
their reason for discontinuing the attic insulation. The release
was never issued, however, and Grace continued to sell the
insulation for seven more years.
</P>
<P>
   W. R. Grace, a $1.5 billion multinational chemical and
construction products company, was thrust into the spotlight by the
1995 book and 1999 movie ``A Civil Action.'' Both were based on a
1982 lawsuit concerning chemical contamination and high leukemia
rates in East Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   At least three government agencies knew there was asbestos in
Grace's attic insulation while it was on the market. Current
government officials have a hard time explaining why the agencies
did not do a better job of following up on their initial concerns
with Grace's product.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency warned in a 1981
study that consumers of products made from the mineral used in
Grace's attic fill ``may be particularly vulnerable and unprotected
due to ignorance of the potential hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until earlier this month that the EPA warned
homeowners to hold off on handling Grace's attic insulation,
believed to still be in thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA made its decision during its emergency investigation of
widespread asbestos contamination in Libby, Mont., where the
material used in the Grace insulation was mined and milled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend, to the extent possible, that you hold off on any
remodeling until we know about the asbestos content of the Zonolite
insulation and any potential health effects,'' the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   Why it took the EPA nearly 20 years to issue a public warning is
unclear. ``That's a grand question,'' said Paul Peronard, the
coordinator of the EPA's Libby team.
</P>
<P>
   William Corcoran, Grace's vice president for public and
regulatory affairs, said, ``We didn't think the product was a
health hazard.'' Despite the new EPA warning, he said, Grace
officials continue to believe the product poses no risk.
</P>
<P>
   Zonolite is a loose-fill insulation that was poured between
attic rafters, under floor boards, and behind walls. It is made
from a gold-colored mineral called vermiculite, mined in Libby,
Mont., and processed at one of 32 plants around the country,
including one in Easthampton.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite asbestos was naturally present in the Libby
vermiculite and the products made from it. Grace removed some, but
not all, of the asbestos, company memos show.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite asbestos is a particularly dangerous form of the
mineral, said Dr. Jacqueline Moline, an occupational and
environmental health specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer linked to asbestos, can develop
from low exposures to tremolite, she said, ``the kind that women
got shaking out their husbands' clothes.''

   John Russell, a Cambridge, Mass. homeowner, recently spent three
days removing Zonolite insulation from his attic in preparation for
a renovation. He said he did not know the insulation contains
asbestos. Though he wore a mask, he said he would have been more
careful had he known about the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disarming to learn at this late date how potentially
dangerous it is,'' he said, adding, ``I was surprised how long the
dust stayed in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he does not know how he should dispose of the
insulation, which now sits in 20 or so garbage bags in his garage.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimated in 1985 that 940,000 American homes contained,
or had contained, Zonolite attic fill, and that Grace held about 85
percent of the market for vermiculite insulation. ``You open up a
wall and it pours out,'' said Eric Anderson, owner of Anderson
Insulation in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just blow right over it,'' said Janet Baronian, assistant
director of Menotomy Weatherization, an Arlington, Mass.
weatherization program for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   All of Grace's Zonolite attic fill came from Libby vermiculite.
Vermiculite from other mines, including one operated by Grace in
Enoree, S.C., is used to make products such as cat litter and
potting soil. Those mines do not appear to be similarly
contaminated, according to Peronard, the EPA study coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos was once considered the most effective fireproofing
material available. But that changed dramatically by the mid-1970s,
as public fears grew about the health hazards of asbestos. As the
number of cases of ailments and diseases linked to the mineral
climbed, asbestos was ripped out of schools. Spackling compounds
and spray fireproofing that contained asbestos were banned, and
hair dryers with asbestos filters were voluntarily withdrawn from
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's Zonolite insulation, however, remained largely
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said that was because his company cooperated with
government agencies and was producing a safe product. ``We never
tried to hide it from anyone,'' he said. The only asbestos
standards in the 1970s were for workers, enforced by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Zonolite Attic
Insulation was designed for consumers, he said, who would have
limited exposure to it compared with workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We complied with that OSHA target at our plants, but it's a
different exposure when Harry Homeowner is involved,'' Corcoran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet OSHA cited Grace for excessive asbestos levels as early as
1976. That kind of violation involving a consumer product such as
Zonolite ``gives you an indication that there could be a problem
downstream, with other workers and consumers,'' said John Martonik,
director of OSHA's office of program evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Egilman, a clinical associate professor in the
Department of Community Health at Brown University, has been a paid
expert witness against the asbestos industry. Though he has not
testified against Grace, he has conducted extensive research on the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace has known about the hazards of asbestos since they
bought the mine in 1963. They knew the asbestos was there and how
toxic it was,'' said Egilman, who has worked a lengthy unit on
Grace into his medical ethics course. He added, ``They've engaged
in a coverup of the toxicity of their products and knowingly failed
to warn people for the purpose of making money and to avoid
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Corcoran, ``We completely reject his theories.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of hundreds of company memos shows that Grace officials
argued publicly against tougher government standards while
privately discussing their concerns about liability and the
potential dangers associated with their product.

 UNDATED: ... their product.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1973, Washington state safety and health officials found high
readings of asbestos at Grace's Spokane plant and advised the
company to place a ``Caution _ contains asbestos'' label on the
attic fill made there.
</P>
<P>
   A Grace official suggested in a Dec. 4, 1973, memo to a vice
president that the company tell the authorities they were
correcting the problems. The memo further stated that ``the word
asbestos has become a real scare word and we are very concerned
about having to put a label on our product when we don't really
believe it is a significant hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1976, OSHA cited Grace's Omaha plant for asbestos
exposure levels from its attic insulation that exceeded both the
agency's 8-hour and 15-minute ceilings for workplace safety. If the
problem was not corrected, regulators warned, they would require a
warning label. Grace estimated it took about two hours for
homeowners to install its attic insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Grace executives responded that no label was needed and if a
problem existed, it could be corrected. They received a one-year
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Within the company, executives discussed company tests showing
high asbestos in attic insulation made at a number of Grace's
plants. They worried about future OSHA inspections and ordered a
series of experiments to try to coat the vermiculite with a
``binder,'' a substance that would prevent fibers from being
released, according to a March 11, 1976, memo. A successful binder
would free them from having to label.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1976, a tougher OSHA asbestos standard went into effect.
Grace tested throughout 1977, sometimes in Cambridge, but memos
show the company had inconsistent results.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1977, Grace produced a series of draft press releases
in preparation for possibly having to pull its attic insulation and
other asbestos-containing products off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The company is ``sufficiently concerned about the entire issue
of asbestos and associated health hazards to discontinue this
product,'' one draft said. Attic insulation ``must be safe beyond
any doubt whatsoever to meet Grace's product standards for sale to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Grace discontinued its attic insulation seven years later _
for economic reasons, Corcoran said _ there was no public
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, 1977, a Grace executive vice president in Cambridge
circulated to top management a 20-page ``personal and
confidential'' memo that discussed Grace's options for dealing with
``the problem'' of asbestos in the Libby vermiculite. ``An in-house
study of mortality rates among ex-employees at Libby indicates that
their risk of lung cancer is five times the national average,'' the
memo said. It also noted that 28 percent of veteran workers at its
many processing plants had been diagnosed with asbestosis, a
debilitating scarring of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The memo reaffirmed Grace's opposition to warning labels. ``We
believe that a decision to affix asbestos warning labels to our
products would result in substantial sales losses.'' It discussed
the option of closing the Libby mine, but rejected it because a
buyer would be difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, an OSHA office in Ohio learned that 32 workers at the
O.M. Scotts and Sons fertilizer plant in Marysville were sick _
they were bleeding into their lungs. The plant made Scotts Turf
Builder, and its main ingredient was Libby vermiculite purchased
from Grace.
</P>
<P>
   This time, word of the illnesses spread beyond a local OSHA
office. By 1980, the EPA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission,
and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health _
OSHA's research arm _ all wanted information about Grace's
vermiculite operations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
proposed a formal study. In November 1980, Grace executives met
with institute officials to argue against it. ``A viral infection
was a more likely Scott explanation than vermiculite,'' one
executive told the officials, according to a Nov. 26, 1980, Grace
memo.
</P>
<P>
   The institute officials were not swayed. They said they would
send Grace a study plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Grace executives said they could respond to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health plan in a number of
ways, including: ``obstruct and block,'' ``publish a pre-emptive
epidemiological study,'' ``cooperate fully,'' or ``attempt to apply
influence via congressmen, senators, lobbyists or others to get it
turned off,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the EPA told Grace it wanted to study the Libby
facility and the company's processing plants. The EPA agreed to
Grace's request to significantly scale back the research. The
agency ended up basing much of its study on estimates rather than
data.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1979, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced that it was going to issue a rule asking companies to
send test results showing the amount of asbestos in their products.
</P>
<P>
   On March 12, 1980, Grace executives called the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the call we learned that vermiculite was not a high
priority at CPSC . . .'' a Sept. 30, 1980, memo stated.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, the executive vice president of Grace's Construction
Products Division sought the company's exemption from any
forthcoming labeling policy.
</P>
<P>
   The letter included 1977 test results of attic insulation that
had been treated with a binder. The executive said the company had
developed a binder and ``recently started up equipment at all its
expanding plants to apply this binder to attic insulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Internally, however, Grace executives were not confident about
the test results.
</P>
<P>
   The Construction Products Division ``does have concern with
attic insulation as shown in the test results,'' stated a March 25,
1980, Grace memo from a project manager to a vice president. The
division's research department was ``continuing binder efforts, but
I see little light at the end of this tunnel during the next 12
months,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA released its final report in 1985, concluding that
exposure to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite is ``an occupational
and consumer concern.'' The National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health report came a year later, recommending a much
lower asbestos exposure limit. That limit is in effect today.
</P>
<P>
   Grace closed its Libby mine in 1990. It opened an office there
late last year to act as a resource for residents and the EPA
during the investigation, Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, deaths in Libby continue to mount. ``Every week there
are more diagnosed,'' said Gayla Benefield, a Libby resident who
said both her parents died from asbestos-related illnesses. ``We
just want to get to the bottom of this.''

 &HT;     Winnie the Pooh CD-ROM shows learning can be fun

   Winnie the Pooh is one of the co-stars of Walt Disney's ``The
Tigger Movie.'' The honey-loving bear is the star of a new CD-ROM:
Disney's Activity Center, Winnie the Pooh. The CD (Windows,
Macintosh; about $30) is designed for children age 6 and up. It's
based on ``The Blustery Day,'' the third story in A.A. Milne's
``The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the company's popular activity-center series, Winnie
the Pooh features arcade-style games, problem-solving activities
and reading. There are six separate activities, most of which have
multiple levels of difficulty:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tigger's Hillside Hop is for one or two players. Tigger and
Rabbit compete in a bouncing/hopping contest to collect presents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Come Fly a Piglet is a side-scrolling arcade-type game in
which kids help Pooh fly Piglet through the Hundred Acre Wood.
Piglet must navigate around debris while kids must lead Pooh over
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find the Bees is an animated story. Parents can read along
with children and help them find hidden bees. At the end of the
story, Pooh tells players whether they've found all the bees. The
next time the child plays the game, the number of bees increases to
keep it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eeyore's House Hunt helps develop logical reasoning as
children try to build a bridge across the river by using building
blocks from the stream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heffalumps and Woozels (the animals Pooh dreams about when
he's asleep) is a matching game, also designed to build logic
skills, that lets children design a Heffalump. Their goal is to
determine which Heffalump doesn't match others on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Owl's Decorating lets children select and place items for
decorating Owl's new tree house.
</P>
<P>
   The program is on the shelves now, and will be joined Feb. 25 by
Disney's first venture into the 3-D arena, Disney's 3-D Adventure,
Tigger's Family Tree.

 Cartoon Network runs afoul of China's doctrine
 &HT;    By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Quayle can rail all he wants about the TV show Murphy Brown,
but when it comes to censorship, nobody can touch the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the government in Beijing banned the broadcasting of
the highly subversive Cartoon Network on Chinese television.
</P>
<P>
   How Scooby-Doo and the Smurfs found themselves on the Communist
Party hit-list is a bit of a mystery, according to a Reuters story.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, who manages to annoy just about everyone, including
his wife, and Time Warner Inc., which owns Turner Broadcastings TNT
&AMP; Cartoon Network, has also had a bumpy relationship with the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman in Hong Kong for Turner Broadcasting System
Asia Pacific said the company was given no reason for the ban,
which took effect last month. ``Their actions violated relevant
Chinese rules,'' said an official with China's State Administration
of Radio, Film and Television. ''They know very well what they
did,'' he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, leaves it to the decadent,
counter-revolutionary, hegemonistic, running-dog Western press (me)
to speculate on the real reasons behind this ban.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, I would just like to say that Cartoon Network is
the best thing on TV, with the possible exception of Judge Wapner
and that crazy Australian guy who wrestles the crocodiles. Space
Ghost has a Fellini-esque quality about it and Cow &AMP; Chicken has
distinctly Orwellian overtones, only with more sight gags. It is
all well worth the $275 a month, or whatever, that Time Warner now
charges me for its basic cable service.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to one possible problem the Chinese may have
with bringing decadent, imperialistic American cable-TV into their
country: The cost. A month of cable service now costs more than the
average Chinese spends on cigarettes in a year, and that does not
include the cost of installation, TV-Guide subscriptions, universal
remote controls, VCRs, DVD players and, of course, one or more
large, flat-screen digital TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting around for days at a time for a service technician to
hook up the cable would also result in a severe decline in
productivity, something the Chinese government cannot afford if it
is to successfully accomplish the Great Leap Forward, or sideways
or up-and-down or whatever direction China's leaders say the
country should be leaping these days.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of the content of the shows on Cartoon
Network, some of which may run afoul of official Communist
doctrine, such as it is at this particular moment. The Flintstones
is one of the shows on Cartoon Network, and I can certainly see how
the Chinese government could have problems with that. Fred, Barney,
Wilma and Betty make the Chinese ''Gang of Four'' look like
cultural visionaries. As China struggles to be accepted as a modern
society, a cartoon about cavemen who bowl with rocks and propel
their cars with their feet would be decidedly unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs Bunny, of course, would be a poison worse than unfiltered
cigarettes and air pollution to the Chinese people. Indeed, Bugs'
snotty attitude and blatant disrespect for authority makes me
wonder why he hasn't been singled out for censorship by American
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs' sidekick, Daffy Duck, has plenty of energy and speaks in a
strange way that could conceivably have Mandarin roots. Still,
there's no guarantee that any number of re-education camps would
straighten out this screwball and make him fly right.
</P>
<P>
   I don't follow Bubbles, Blossom, Buttercup, Dexter and Boomerang
as closely as I should, but I feel sure that there are more than
enough decadent and/or politically incorrect scenes in these
cartoons to make them unacceptable to the powers-that-be in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only cartoon that the Chinese government might
identify with is Johnny Bravo, which features a clueless,
muscle-bound bully who thinks he's wonderful but everyone else
recognizes as a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he sounds like Elvis, which never hurts.
</P>

GIOVANNI RIBISI TURNS UP TEMPERATURE IN `BOILER ROOM'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sleepy-eyed guy isn't the type who immediately commands
attention. But as Giovanni Ribisi builds a character bit by
painstaking bit on screen, he becomes increasingly mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley-raised actor can already claim a remarkably diverse
body of work at the age of 25. Ribisi has proven equally adept at
searing drama (as the dedicated medic in Steven Spielberg's
``Saving Private Ryan'') and crack character comedy (as Lisa
Kudrow's zonky, parenthood-obsessed brother on the smash sitcom
``Friends''). He's convincingly played mentally challenged (``The
Other Sister'') and creatively eccentric when nothing else creative
was going on around him (last year's ``Mod Squad'' feature
debacle).
</P>
<P>
   And now, the sweet-tempered, unfailingly polite young family man
is about to show you why you should never, ever trust him with your
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room,'' opening Friday, offers Ribisi his biggest
opportunity yet to strut his versatile stuff. He plays an
intelligent but wayward New Yorker, Seth Davis, who's torn between
his desire for the approval of his harsh judge of a father (Ron
Rifkin) and his talent for making quick, illegitimate bucks. A
college dropout, Seth does all right running an illegal casino in
his apartment. But when a chance to become a stockbroker presents
itself, he jumps at the chance to make even more money in a way his
father won't criticize.
</P>
<P>
   Except ... the brokerage Seth trains at is a chop shop, a high-
pressure, cold-calling outfit dedicating to selling suckers
essentially worthless securities. As Seth learns to excel at
working the phones and exploiting his faceless ``clients''' greed
and fear, he also discovers that he might have the one thing
neither he nor his heartless colleagues need: a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show Seth becoming this other kind of person,
whether it be more confident or, the other side of that coin, more
decadent,'' says Ribisi, dressed like a millionaire in a
four-button suit jacket and matching gray shirt and tie. ``Him
starting to hate himself more but being caught on this tidal wave
of success. He doesn't know what's happening or if he's doing the
right thing, and I tried to keep my attention on his progression
into that.'' Seth was also a technically demanding performance that
required Ribisi to pitch fast over telephones while a dozen other
people caused distractions all around him. Doesn't look it,
perhaps, but that's an extreme test of an actor's concentration. To
rehearse, Ribisi would spend up to 12 hours a day at an audition
theater in New York, getting his phone technique down pat.
</P>
<P>
   According to fellow Valley actor Lisa Kudrow, that's typical of
his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing he can't do, it feels like,'' Kudrow says.
``I've only worked with him on the TV show, and that's one kind of
acting. But with that, no problems. Whatever he needs to do, there
are no obstacles. And that's one of the most important things about
acting, to just be open to everything, and everything that needs to
get done is just incorporated and justified to make it look like
all is reasonable and working. He just makes everything work.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that needed to get done for the ``Boiler Room'' gig
was understanding the ethically undernourished mindset of the
hard-sell brokers. Writer-director Ben Younger, who had been
recruited for the kind of chop shop the film depicts when he was
struggling to make the transition from cameraman to auteur, could
provide some observations and contacts. But research was no cinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go find a chop shop, much less call 'em up and
go, `Hey, can I come down and watch you guys for a film that I'm
doing?''' Ribisi says with a laugh. ``But some of the people
Younger put me in touch with wanted the movie to get it right. One
of the guys was still a broker who had worked for another firm that
the FBI had shut down. He'd lost somebody who'd lived in Texas
$60,000, and his viewpoint was, `These people are just faceless
voices. The idea is, if they're stupid enough to give me that much
money over the phone, then they shouldn't have it anyway.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that morals are like a personal deal for every
individual. I suppose those guys could justify it by saying it's a
dog-eat-dog world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind of values that have come down to Ribisi through
three previous generations of Sicilian-American forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-grandfather came over and settled in the Bay Area,
which had a big Italian community,'' he explains. ``They were
farmers, proletariat; the lifestyle was the work ethic, get your
education, family. It's the Sicilian way, what can I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ribisi's father, Al, was also drawn to the arts. Working in the
San Francisco one-hit wonder band People led him to L.A., where he
later went into the printing business. Giovanni initially planned
to follow in his father's footsteps _ a dedicated guitarist, he has
his own recording studio _ but acting seemed a natural career path
for a kid who grew up in North Hollywood. Ribisi says that his
mother, Gay, a producer-manager, entered show business around the
same time that he did.
</P>
<P>
   But while living here was what sparked his interest in acting,
Ribisi also credits his Valley childhood with instilling a valuable
degree of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that I didn't grow up in Hollywood and get into that
whole scene type thing, like, `Yeah, I know this person and that
person,''' he says. And while Ribisi had a reputation as something
of a party scenester in his younger days, since marrying actress
Mariah O'Brien Ribisi three years ago and the birth of their
daughter, Lucia, he could arguably claim to have the most settled
lifestyle of any actor in his age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about my wife and daughter, and trying to be better as an
actor,'' he says. ``If I'm not working or whatever, I'm probably
jumping around with Lucia and singing different songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribisi also credits the Church of Scientology with helping out
in the success and stability departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really say I was born a Scientologist, although my
parents were members,'' he says of the sometimes controversial
church. ``It's an applied religious philosophy for me, and it's
something very pragmatic that works. I know it's been in the press
and all that stuff, but it's helped me immeasurably in all aspects
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, on the career front, is racing ahead at top speed. Ribisi
has a major role in the Nicolas Cage summer action spectacular
``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' for which he learned how to hotwire cars in
half the title time and build a '69 Camaro from parts. He kept the
muscle car, too, although, ``We have a nice Suburban for driving
the daughter around in,'' he notes with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Ribisi also provides the off-screen narration for Sofia
Coppola's acclaimed feature debut ``The Virgin Suicides'' and is
currently filming the Billy Bob Thornton-scripted Southern drama
``The Gift'' with Cate Blanchett, Keanu Reeves and Hilary Swank.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means, of course, that there's an increasing amount
of income to be managed. Ribisi admits that that's something he's
never paid a lot of attention to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' he confesses. ``I knew that I did movies, and
someone else handled the money, you know what I'm saying? Now I'm
very conscious of money, so I'm trying to save it up and be smart
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is in the stock market, his ``Boiler Room'' experience
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very conservative about it,'' he explains. ``I asked that
broker, the one who lost the guy $60,000 and didn't care. I
figured, this guy was all over the place and would be a good one to
ask how he would personally invest in the market. He said, `Just
blue chip.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But no, the movie didn't scare me away from investing. It did
scare me away from buying things over the phone, but that's easy
for me anyway. People don't know how to pronounce my name, so when
a cold caller says, `Is Gy-oh-ven-I Rob-a-sy there,' I just say,
`No, he's not.''' &QL;

WE ALL KNOW WHERE SHE GOT THE INSPIRATION ...
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eve Ensler doesn't mince words, though some people wish she
would. The mere title of her play, coming to L.A. for one
star-studded benefit performance on Wednesday, is enough to stir
controversy: ``The Vagina Monologues.''
</P>
<P>
   Explained Ensler in a phone interview from her home in New York,
``The title is really important. It's not to shock or titillate
anyone, not to get them into the theater under a false pretense.
It's all about talking about, discussing and remembering vaginas.''
</P>
<P>
   So ... what does that mean? The play, which Ensler developed as
a one-woman show, draws on interviews she did with real women who
talked about their relationship with their most private and
seldom-discussed body part. Among the larger issues drawn out:
shame, abuse, pleasure and the wonder of bringing new life into the
world. Ensler contends that women talking about sex and their
bodies is central to ``our ability to exist or not to exist. To me,
if you can't talk about it, it means you don't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensler contends that the word penis, on the other hand, is
positively accepted. ``I don't think people have a problem
discussing that at all,'' she said. ``You can say `penis' on
television, but not `vagina.'''
</P>
<P>
   Famous actresses and musicians by the dozen apparently agree
with Ensler. The performance of ``VM'' at the Wiltern on Wednesday
will include such notables as Gillian Anderson, Roseanne, Winona
Ryder, Calista Flockhart and Melissa Etheridge. A benefit
performance in New York last year attracted Glenn Close, Susan
Sarandon and Rosie Perez.
</P>

   ``The only person I can think of who I'd really like to do
('VM') and hasn't is Meryl Streep. She did another of my plays,
`Necessary Targets,''' Ensler said. ``I've been very happy with the
response. So many amazing women have done it.'' She admits there is
also some buzz about Jane Fonda, recently separated from Ted
Turner, doing the play as well. Fonda herself mentioned the
possibility at a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Ensler is no stranger to celebrity. In addition to attracting
stars who have appeared in her plays over the years, Ensler is the
adoptive mother (though she's only a few years older) of ``The
Practice's'' Dylan McDermott. Ensler wrote him his first part in a
New York play and has remained close to the actor, even after
divorcing his father years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``VM'' is proving to have a life far beyond starry galas like
Wednesday's, presented as a charity benefit by the Step Up Women's
Network and Lifetime Television. The show, which Ensler has mainly
performed solo, continues off-Broadway in New York. Ensler says
about 150 colleges and universities are participating in ``V-Day''
activities this week, including a Valentine's Day performance at
California State University, Long Beach, to help raise awareness
and money to support organizations that combat violence against
women (for more information on these activities, go to
www.feminist.com).
</P>
<P>
   Ensler adds that though she can't yet announce it or discuss the
details, there's a good chance ``VM'' will be taped to air on a
premium cable channel ... where you can say the word ``vagina.'' &QL;

&HT;     SPRAWL IS MAJOR CONCERN IN BAY AREA, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANNIE NAKAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Internet millionaires and their technology
companies redefine the San Francisco Bay Area, residents are
sharing in the boom times but also finding themselves victims of
their own success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Development is out of hand,'' said Barbara Harper, 61, a
resident of the east Contra Costa community of Bay Point. ``The
traffic on Highway 4 is horrendous, but they just keep building and
building. What are all these people going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Urban sprawl and traffic congestion, poverty and homelessness,
the quality of public schools and a host of other issues worried
Harper and many of the 500 Bay Area residents recently polled by
the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   While the vast majority of respondents enjoyed living here,
nearly half, or 47 percent, cited sprawl, growth and traffic as
``far and away the most important problem in the region,''
according to a report on the findings, titled, ``Straight Talk From
Americans 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-county Bay Area was one of four metropolitan areas
surveyed by Pew to accompany a national poll on the state of the
nation and its communities. Details of the national findings are to
be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus
4 percentage points, surveyed residents in Alameda, Marin, San
Francisco, Contra Costa, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties from
Oct. 29 to Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted for Pew by Princeton Survey Research Associates of
Washington, the poll showed the Bay Area led the other cities _
Denver, Philadelphia and Tampa, Fla. _ in the number of residents
who said their area was an excellent place to live.
</P>
<P>
   By another measure, though, they seemed less enthusiastic about
where they lived. Some 62 percent said they were satisfied ``with
the way things are going in the San Francisco area,'' compared to
74 percent of Americans overall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the robust economy, it was clear that Bay Area residents
were concerned that not everyone shared in the current prosperity:
14 percent cited poverty, homelessness and hunger as the
second-most-important problem facing the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable finding in a time of substantial
prosperity nationwide and in at least parts of the San Francisco
Bay Area,'' the report said. ``This challenges the common
perception of the area as flush with the prosperity generated by
Silicon Valley and the Internet revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bay Area residents were decidedly critical of the police and
local government, handing in the lowest rankings of all four cities
when asked if they thought those two institutions treated people
fairly. Only 47 percent thought the police ``treated everyone the
same, while 59 percent felt local government did.''
</P>
<P>
   _ There were sharp racial divisions in the perception of how
people are treated by various institutions, a pattern that has been
long been documented nationwide. For example, while 69 percent of
Bay Area whites felt there was ``an equal chance for a good
education in public schools,'' only 33 percent of African-Americans
did.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attitudes toward immigrants were divided, with a third of
respondents saying immigrants either contribute to the community or
caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixty-three percent said the quality of public schools was a
problem, although 50 percent of parents said they were very
satisfied with their children's schools. Also, 74 percent of those
polled said they believed the schools should teach ``values,
respect and courtesy'' in addition to academic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   _ While 38 percent of respondents said crime was a big problem
in their communities, an overwhelming majority said they believed
either ``very'' or ``somewhat'' safe at home or in their
neighborhoods.

<P>
   The millennium bug was not a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 ``significant'' failures were caused by the
rollover from 1999 to 2000 in January alone, says the consultancy
KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the faults were trivial, a number were
potentially serious, including reported failures in nuclear power
plants and blackouts on military spy satellite processing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Y2K faults are still emerging, and could reach a
peak over the next few months with the occurrence of the leap year
and the end of the financial year.
</P>
<P>
   Banks warn that Feb. 29 is likely to trigger more problems than
the New Year's Eve rollover, because some calendar software failed
to notice that _ unusually for a ``00'' year _ this is a leap year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.K., a survey by the Office of National Statistics
found that 5 percent of companies reported some sort of adverse
impact on computer systems arising from the year change,'' said
Malcolm Marshall, KPMG's information risk management partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the U.S., a survey of IT professionals found a quarter
had experienced some sort of Y2K problem since the New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even computer manufacturers were not immune to the problem,
which prompted many organizations to invest millions of pounds to
protect their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, in a Stock Exchange announcement, said that in January it
had ``experienced a limited number of minor malfunctions in its
information technology (IT) systems as the result of the date
change,'' despite spending $10 million preparing against such
problems. Those mostly affected its manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   David Walton, of the British Y2K Community Action Network _ some
of whose members forecast that the millennium bug would spell
disaster for civilization _ said: ``I would say that I was
pleasantly surprised by how little disruption there was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did see a lot of low-impact bugs, which was interesting _
it suggests that the high-impact ones were identified and dealt
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walton works as an IT consultant and was so worried about
the potential for collapse that on New Year's Eve he had a
generator ready to kick in if the electricity supply failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was all so safe, why did the (British) Government have a
Millennium Center with 200 staff? You have to ask yourself what
they knew about what might happen that they didn't tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by KPMG noted that ``the experience so far seems to
be that problems are being rapidly dealt with once they become
apparent.'' Of the recorded incidents, 67 were in the first week of
the year and 23 came later.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, companies are still discovering problems with their
systems caused by the shift to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations needs to remain vigilant around the key dates of
the leap year and the end of months,'' said Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents recorded by KPMG were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seven U.S. nuclear plants had ``minor problems.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Japanese nuclear plants had ``failures.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon was unable to process spy satellite data for a
number of hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ France's military satellites ``lost'' data.
</P>
<P>
   _ A kidney machine in Scotland failed during routine running.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cash and credit cards issued by American banks would not
validate.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the U.S., Medicare payments were disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hundreds of Web sites displayed the date as ``January 1,
1900'' due to misprogramming; almost as many displayed it as
``January 1, 19100.''
</P>
<P>
   _ U.K. Register Office reported dates of birth as 20200.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kremlin Press Agency was unable to send out e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   _ Traffic lights in Jamaica failed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Port traffic software in Uganda displayed wrong dates.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 50 minor problems at six major Japanese electronics
firms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Customer records at a foreign bank in Japan deleted.
</P>
<P>
   _ A customer returning a rented videotape was charged $91,000
for being 100 years late. &QL;

&HT;     DIALLO'S MOTHER SPEAKS OF THE PAIN OF LOSING HER CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By THEOLA S. LABBE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kadiatou Diallo, the mother of the young man
gunned down by police in the Bronx last year, talks about her son
in a hotel room at the Crowne Plaza here. Asked about Amadou, her
first child, whom she bore at age 16, she says simply, ``It was
like we grew up together. That's why I say it's very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a violet-colored gown with ivory trim at the neck, she
remembers the phone call from New York that came to her in Guinea,
West Africa, a year ago. It was early in the morning, New York
time, and if the call was not from Amadou, then she knew it was
about him.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in America for a few years. He was killed in front
of his Bronx home by four police officers, shot 19 times. He was
holding a beeper and a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the officers are on trial in Albany, and Amadou Diallo's
mother had come to the courthouse every day since jury selection
began Jan. 31. But last Tuesday, when she knew the medical examiner
would testify about precisely how her son was killed, she chose to
stay in her room at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what was going on. My lawyers prepared me,'' Kadiatou
says.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, a prosecution witness, Dr. Joseph Cohen, used
projector-enlarged images of a human body pocked with bullet holes
to explain which ones he believed hit Amadou Diallo first and which
ones did the most damage. In her hotel room, Kadiatou spent the day
reading messages from a condolence book started by Raz Chowdhury, a
friend of her son from Manhattan, and signed by New Yorkers from
all parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The kind words gave her comfort. ``It was very touching,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   She also talked by phone to her three other children. She
chooses now, being interviewed, not to say where they are living.
</P>
<P>
   And as required by Muslim tradition, Kadiatou prayed five times
that day, kneeling on a prayer mat that faced east toward Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's evening. Her religion, Kadiatou says, has been crucial
in getting through this past year, and her days in Albany. She
folds up her prayer mat and carries it inside the courtroom so she
can pray with family members _ men separate from the women as
required by Muslim custom _ in a third-floor room in the courthouse
during breaks in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time we pray, we make a special prayer to the deceased,''
Kadiatou says. ``It's like a message sent to my son. It's very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   She explains that the Muslim faith discourages mourners from
constantly crying about their dead loved ones. The deceased can see
you and your tears, she says, and may also become sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if you want the deceased to rest in peace, you
have to be strong, not to cry all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   As if someone has already posed the question, she continued.
``It's impossible to say that you cannot cry, but after that, you
pray also.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadiatou Diallo never saw her son after he left Guinea for the
United States in September 1996, intent on going to college to
study computers. Although she had a visa and could have visited,
she chose to stay in Guinea, keeping in touch by phone at least
three times a week.
</P>

   ``For the first time, I realized he wanted to be responsible and
wanted to be a man,'' she says. ``I didn't want to try and
intervene so much because I was proud of him. I decided to let him
be a man.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months after arriving in America, Diallo saved enough
money to ship a computer back home to his mother. He wanted her to
set it up so the two could e-mail, Kadiatou explains. With watery
eyes, she says the computer is in her home in Guinea. ``It is very
precious,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they spoke by phone, the Sunday of the week he was
killed, he had called her. She was not expecting to hear from him.
</P>
<P>
   He was very proud to talk about himself that day and had called
with good news. He had done manual labor and was working as a
street vendor in Manhattan, and now he planned to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ```Mom, I will do it,''' says Kadiatou, recalling her
22-year-old son's words.
</P>
<P>
   Kadiatou would not comment on the trial, except to say she feels
it's the ``first time that we are observing the justice system
doing (its) job.'' She has declined to say what she believes would
constitute justice in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Her life in Albany revolves around the trial, prayer and talking
with her family, with little time to see the city outside of the
hotel and the courthouse. In that regard, her lawyers have taken
her out to dinner on occasion, which has been helpful, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys Robert Conason and Anthony Gair will represent
Kadiatou Diallo in any civil procedure, which would come later. The
criminal trial, which has drawn national attention, may conclude
this week or early next week. Her lawyers accompanied her for the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She talks of a legend that a member of the Diallo family will
bear a child that the world will talk about. Kadiatou says her
father told her the story repeatedly when she was a girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is Amadou, it's very sad,'' she says, ``but everybody's
talking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of immense sorrow and scrutiny, Kadiatou wants to
maintain her composure. ``I believe in having dignity,'' she says.
``Even if I am suffering, I want not to show it somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for him,'' she adds, ``for my family, it's us.''

   CHARLESTON _ George W. Bush is struggling to keep his campaign
ahead of his rival John McCain, as the challenger makes gains on
him across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remains publicly calm. But behind the scenes, his campaign
and its backers are fighting frenziedly to ensure that the
front-runner maintains his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They are ditching visits to other states, boosting spending and
trying to reshape the way their candidate is seen in the crucial
contest in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tried to reorientate his campaign, appearing more
active, more engaged and less self-assured of his own victory.
``It's good for me to have a good fight,'' said Bush on a
television discussion program Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was going to win, he said ``Yes Sir.'' Then he
interrupted himself to say: ``I take nothing for granted. I want
you to know that.'' In New Hampshire, he was seen as arrogant and
presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost the New Hampshire primary, and if he loses South
Carolina, he will also lose all of his lustre as the party's
heir-apparent; McCain will start to look like the victor rather
than just a successful insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   The two are in a dead heat in the Southern state, which votes
this Saturday. A poll in Newsweek shows Bush at 43 percent and
McCain at 40 percent, which given the margin of error makes it too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is recruiting among the state's independents and
Democrats; Bush has a firm base in the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The race will turn on how many independents McCain can actually
bring out to vote, and his campaign is aimed at mobilizing this
constituency _ Democrats and independents can vote in the
Republican primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The event brought out 278,000 voters four years ago; this year,
the Republicans expect it to bring out between 350,000 and 400,000.
The higher the number, the more likely a victory for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Negative advertisements by both sides have dented McCain's
ratings since he was ahead a week ago. They may also damp down
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has now dropped his own negative ads, but Bush has said
that he will not: his publicity simply states his case against the
arguments which McCain has made. ``I'm not going to get defined,''
he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain gained the upper hand by depicting
himself as a rebel and an outsider, and Bush as the favorite of the
governing elite.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has now run up a surprising lead in Michigan, the next
primary state, which votes days after South Carolina. The Detroit
News shows him leading Bush by nine percentage points, having been
34 points behind.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems to have lost the respect of some voters, to put it
mildly. ``He's just a wealthy, wimpy, whiny sniveller,'' Carl
Bellmer, a 66-year-old retired car worker from Lansing, told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Bush's lead over McCain is down from 44 percentage
points to twelve. Yet Bush has cancelled some appearances to shore
up his position in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that his campaign is starting to deal with the
possibility that he might actually win the election, speculation is
starting to appear about a McCain presidency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News and World Report says that possible vice-presidential
candidates might be drawn from the ``digerati.'' Jeff Bezos,
founder of Amazon.com, Jerry Yang, founder of Yahoo!, and Andy
Grove of Intel are mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wants a retired flag officer as secretary of defense and
Colin Powell as secretary of state, it says. &QL;

   SCI-PEREGRINE-FALCON (Undated) _ Though conservationists say the
war to save endangered species is being lost, the peregrine falcon
is a stunning victory. The American peregrine now has about 2,000
wild pairs nesting in the United States and Canada, up from 39 in
1975. And it has flown off the federal list of endangered species
in what Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt called a

A nurse's aide in Brooklyn. A freshman at a college north of New
York City. In the course of 48 hours, all three were the targets of
homicidal attacks by men with whom they had shared intimate

husband, a former husband, a boyfriend or a former boyfriend.
However, many experts believe that the true figure is much higher.

   SCI-PARALLEL-UNIVERSE (Undated) _ The discovery two years ago
that the expansion of the universe is speeding up has presented
physicists and cosmologists with a major problem. The gravity of
all the known matter and energy in our own universe should slow
that expansion down, not speed it up. Looking for a way out of this
perplexity, several cosmologists are now suggesting a radical idea
_ that the cosmic acceleration may be an effect from some other, or
parallel, universe. By James Glanz.

   SCI-HABITAT-EDGE () _ A study of the burrowing beetle has led
researchers to conclude that one of the basic tenets of modern
conservation theory _ that a wild species would persist most
abundantly and robustly in the center of its geographical range _
might be misguided, to the possible detriment of many endangered
species. By William K. Stevens. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DNA-BEADS (Undated) _ A new technique may be about to join
an array of powerful tools for analyzing the individual human cell.
The method is based on attaching very large sets of DNA molecules,
such as all of a cell's active genes, to invisibly small plastic
beads. Once anchored to the beads, the genes can be compared,
sorted and even sequenced in parallel. Since thousands of genes are
handled at a time, the bead system can generate vast amounts of
information. By Nicholas Wade. (1800 words)

but is generated by heat from a completely different source: from
deep in the planet, not from sunlight. By John Noble Wilford. (650

   SCI-SHINGLES-THERAPY (Undated) _ Until recently, shingles were
considered an unavoidable risk of old age, impossible to predict or
prevent and often accompanied by pain doctors have found
notoriously difficult to control. Now, new research is enabling
better treatments, and volunteers are being sought to determine if
the newly available vaccine to prevent chickenpox in children may

keep under wraps. By Leslie Berger. (1500 words)

They were probably born that way. By Erica Goode. (800 words)

increase in the numbers of couples living together without
marriage. By Leslie Berger.

   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
nutrition:

   _ Adults who like to think of America's young as a bunch of

&HT;     SOME DEMOCRATS WOULD PREFER BUSH AS GOP NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ California Democrats appear to favor Texas
Gov. George W. Bush as the rival to their party's nominee,
believing that Arizona Sen. John McCain would be a far more
formidable foe in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Party regulars interviewed at the state Democratic convention
over the weekend overwhelmingly said they would rather face Bush
than McCain, who beat Bush in the New Hampshire primary and has
made gains in South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary
this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain is a more formidable opponent,'' said Humberto
Lujan, 75, a longtime party activist who supports former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination. ``He appears to be
far more substantive than George W. Bush. I think we can blow all
kinds of holes in Bush, but that's a lot harder to do with
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats fear Bush's ability to raise money for his
campaign, party activists said McCain's background as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam and his image as a straight talker make him a
tougher potential foe for the eventual Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a war hero. How can you attack him for that?'' said Gene
Crabb, 73, a lifelong Democrat and retired Army master sergeant
from Modesto. Crabb said he watched some of the early Republican
debates in Iowa and New Hampshire and believed McCain was a
stronger debater with a better grasp of the issues than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Crabb, who supports Vice President Al Gore as the Democratic
nominee, said he thinks the vice president would fare better
against Bush. Bush, he said, is ``something of a political novice.
He's never been on the national stage before.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's surprising surge after winning the New Hampshire
primary on Feb. 1 has compelled Democrats and Republicans alike to
ponder the idea of McCain as the possible GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Bush and his supporters suggested that
Democrats in open primary states like New Hampshire were
mischievously crossing party lines to vote for McCain in the GOP
primary because he would be a weaker opponent in November. McCain
countered that the Bush camp's accusation ``flies in the face of
the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of California's Democratic Party, who are staying
neutral in the Bradley-Gore race, said they don't care who becomes
the Republican nominee. Both Bush and McCain are beatable, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have substantial liabilities,'' said state party
chairman Art Torres, who criticized both as anti-choice on
abortion, pro-gun and lax on environmental protections. ``They're
the Siamese twins of Republican ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders clearly are paying more attention to McCain
because he has moved up in polls in California and elsewhere. When
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., attacked Bush's abortion record as
Texas governor in a speech at the convention Saturday, she quickly
followed by criticizing McCain for casting 82 pro-life votes in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party strategist Bob Mulholland said McCain's
rise reminds voters of Bush's vulnerabilities as a candidate. And
if McCain wins in South Carolina, he could be seen as the new GOP
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins, Mulholland vows that the party will pound away on
issues such as abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Democrats are more focused on picking their own
nominee. Bradley and Gore both addressed the convention, but the
feeling among delegates was that Gore is a heavy favorite. A Field
Poll last week in California showed Gore leading Bradley 54 to 13
percent. The state primary is March 7.

 &HT;    Why Rocker? Is he a chip off our own?
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new poll out in Newsweek, and it fascinates me.
</P>
<P>
   It's about John Rocker. Remember him?
</P>
<P>
   He's the Atlanta Braves pitcher who shot off his mouth to a
magazine reporter and ranted about kids with purple hair and gays
with AIDS and women with more than one baby and Italians who speak
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Italians who speak Italian! Now that's outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   How revolting!
</P>
<P>
   But what's even more revolting is that I know John Rocker's
name, can roll it off my tongue like I were saying, ``Sit up and
eat your breakfast.'' It's that easy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Lewis? Rae Carruth?
</P>
<P>
   I had to look those names up in the archives _ couldn't recall
them to save my tired soul.
</P>
<P>
   And they're charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   The whole Rocker thing is nuts. Some sports guy spouts, and we
go ballistic. We gasp. We dial up the AM talk-radio guys. We read
every little morsel about his transparent apology and his visits to
a shrink. We applaud his month-long suspension from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But we should be gasping at ourselves. Why should we care what's
rattling around in John Rocker's empty head?
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that's why Newsweek asked this question:
</P>
<P>
   What would happen to your job if you talked like John Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent said they'd be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Another 13 percent said they'd be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one percent said they'd be ostracized by their workers.
</P>
<P>
   And 26 percent said nothing would happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine even thinking the things John Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I can't imagine predicting what would happen if Italked like John Rocker did.
</P>
<P>
   See what I'm saying? Those 1,300 people who answered the
Newsweek poll, isn't it possible _ indeed, probable _ that they're
saying: I can't really speak my mind at work because I might get
fired. Or suspended. Or ostracized by my colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And I find that a whole lot scarier than John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that fascinates me about Rocker, and our reaction to
him, is that we're outraged by all the wrong things. We'd much
rather go along pretending that people don't think the things that
Rocker was stupid enough to say.
</P>
<P>
   People can do whatever they want, and it doesn't seem to stick
to us.
</P>
<P>
   Robbery? Drugs? Some football player getting arrested for
murder? It just isn't that shocking anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But have you heard about John Rocker? He called gay guys queers!
He picked on foreigners. He made fun of women with lots of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Rocker won't be with his team when it reports to
spring training in Orlando next week. He's been suspended for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a shame. He shouldn't be allowed to miss one single
day of his penance.
</P>
<P>
   Which is mainly to put on his uniform, take the field and allow
all the John Rockers of the world to heckle him and boo him _ all
season long.

   Robbery? Drugs? Some football player getting arrested for
murder? It just isn't that shocking anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But have you heard about John Rocker? He called gay guys queers!
He picked on foreigners. He made fun of women with lots of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Rocker won't be with his team when it reports to
spring training in Orlando next week. He's been suspended for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a shame. He shouldn't be allowed to miss one single
day of his penance.
</P>
<P>
   Which is mainly to put on his uniform, take the field and allow
all the John Rockers of the world to heckle him and boo him _ all
season long.

Bon appetit on the Strip

</P>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- Fresh chestnut soup. Lobster risotto with white
truffles. Flaky, tasty vol au vent -- at a buffet station. Dry-aged
strip steak in seven spices, stuffed with Bulgarian feta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   This is the dining experience in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   It is now.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, this city has expended a great deal of
energy redefining itself -- constructing hotels that mirror
European retreats, opening lavish spas, stocking exotic products at
chi-chi boutiques, lifting the curtain on Broadway kick lines. It
was bound to work up an appetite.
</P>
<P>
   As a direct result, the inclination to dine in comfort and
elegance can be indulged at dozens of establishments along the
Strip. Why, it seems a dealer can't sweep the chips off a roulette
table without accidentally jabbing an elbow into a celebrity chef.
The famous cooks who oversee kitchens here (or at least lend their
names to enterprises) include Julian Serrano, Emeril Lagasse,
Wolfgang Puck, Joachim Splichal, Mark Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Two establishments just received coveted five-star ratings from
the Mobil Travel Guide: Serrano's Picasso (at Bellagio) and
Alessandro Stratta's Renoir (at the Mirage).
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles diners, meanwhile, can seek out the familiar:
Matsuhisa of Beverly Hills has reincarnated as Nobu at the Hard
Rock Hotel; Santa Monica's Border Grill has popped up under that
name at Mandalay Bay; a derivation of Studio City's Pinot Bistro
can be found here as Pinot Brasserie at the Venetian; Santa
Monica's Valentino has surfaced under that name at the Venetian.
</P>
<P>
   Food is an important component of Las Vegas' ongoing bid to
attract business from the tourist industry's mid- to upper markets
resort travelers and white-collar conventioneers. But the city's
eats aren't entirely clustered at the high end of the price scale.
</P>
<P>
   To complement their fancy restaurants, several chefs have also
opened cafe establishments, where the food and wine are priced more
accessibly and the most casual of attire is accepted. Buffets at
the new hotels -- priced a bit higher than Strip tradition, but
still reasonable -- are offering gourmet items. And there are
several new restaurants that are directly targeted to kids,
featuring gimmicky surroundings and hefty portions of American
classics.
</P>
<P>
   Can't quite part with such Las Vegas standards as the $5.99
buffet, the 32-ounce rib-eye steak or the casino hot dog? Don't
worry. For people with cast-iron boilers, those classics aren't
going anywhere. You just have to wander far from the glitz of
re-created Italian villas and Polynesian hideaways to find them.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit here, nine of the Strip's establishments were
sampled over a period of three days -- from the top of the scale to
near the buffet bottom, with several stops in the intermediate
ranges. At that, I felt as if I'd I just nibbled around the edges
of the city's culinary renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ---Roots
</P>
<P>
   Here's where it all started: Spago and Spago Cafe in the Forum
Shops at Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than seven years ago, Puck and the executives who
manage his Los Angeles-area establishments reasoned that Las Vegas,
long thought to be peopled by impatient, undiscriminating gamblers
who ate on the run, was ripe for something a little more exalted.
The restaurants opened under the same roof (and awning) in December
1992, and experienced such exponential success that casino bosses
all over town scrambled to corral household-name chefs of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   It's obviously still a popular spot. The dining room is dressy,
with a menu to match. Many visitors seem to gravitate to the cafe,
which is outdoors but only in Las Vegas' trademark sense of
suspended reality. It's a sidewalk setting in the upscale indoor
mall that is the Forum Shops. You sit beneath a movie-set sky in
climate-controlled comfort. Picture fine dining in the Galleria.
During our dinner, we counted four sunsets in the distance near the
animatronic statues.
</P>
<P>
   There are no standards of decorum at the cafe. Near our table
were two women in elegant black evening wear and jewelry, next to
them a table of teens in sweatshirts and baseball caps. A guy in a
suit. A kid in a hockey jersey. Thus, people from L.A. will feel
right at home.
</P>
<P>
   David Robins is the executive chef here, and he does a
commendable job of maintaining Spago's West Hollywood traditions.
Yes, the menu includes smoked-salmon pizza with a generous dollop
of osetra caviar in the center of each slice. A homemade
pappardelle pasta was served slightly al dente, with grilled
shrimp, tomatoes and a basil pesto. The Caesar salad, big enough to
split, was refreshingly without gimmicks -- with thick shavings of
Parmesan cheese and an anchovy laid out helplessly across its
crest. The seafood in the Maine crab cakes appetizer was remarkably
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   And here was a revelation: excellent California wines that
weren't priced through the fake roof. A pinot blanc from Au Bon
Climat in the Santa Ynez Valley cost only $34. Dinner for two (two
starter courses, two main courses, a bottle of wine, one dessert,
plus tax and tip) came in at $135.
</P>
<P>
   Advisory: A table along the exterior railing is desirable in
most sidewalk cafes, but you might want to request a table set back
a bit. Las Vegas is still wrestling to achieve a measure of
sophistication, and the effect hasn't fully set in yet. We observed
passers-by slowing down and openly gawking at diners' plates, as if
watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   ---Southwest sensations
</P>
<P>
   Coyote Cafe, the creation of Southwest wizard Mark Miller, is
another casual, reasonably priced establishment that complements an
upscale cousin (the Grill Room). They share the same frontage in
the gargantuan MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   As at Spago Cafe, this is a sidewalk setting, though along an
indoor walkway, and ambiance, accordingly, takes a beating. During
our lunch there, the electronic bleeps and blurks of the nearby
casino games bled down the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   But the food was spicy and savory, representing clever
variations on familiar items. The Southwest tasting platter
featured a chicken enchilada made with a blue-corn tortilla and
smothered in salsa verde, a duck quesadilla and a gordita -- a
thick, pitalike corn tortilla pocket stuffed with pork and other
goodies.
</P>
<P>
   From the Baja portion of the menu, a Cabo-style tostada boasted
a generous complement of shrimp, plus asadero cheese, black beans
and roma tomato slices. If you're looking for a light course at a
Southwest-Mexican restaurant, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   For the slaking of a thirst, the bar serves four Mexican beers,
plus 32- ounce margaritas that come in glasses 2 feet tall. Lunch
for two with beer was $46.
</P>
<P>
   Advisory: When the waiter first arrives and asks if you'd like
chips and salsa, be advised that they don't come complimentary.
You'll pay $3 for this snack.
</P>
<P>
   ---Prime cut
</P>
<P>
   What is it about being in the desert that stirs a craving for a
generous cut of grilled, juicy beef? In its frontier-theme days,
Las Vegas had steakhouses in every block. In the rejuvenated
stretch of the Strip, it still does; they're just better.
</P>
<P>
   Choose from among Delmonico, Gallagher's, Morton's of Chicago,
the Palm or Smith &AMP; Wollensky. Or Charlie Palmer Steak, which
opened at the Four Seasons just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hotel itself, the restaurant is blissfully removed from
the clamor of casino gambling. And it shamelessly plays to Rat Pack
Revival: dark, clublike, comfortable, with tables well-spaced. At
the adjacent bar, there is overstuffed living-room furniture, a
generous supply of Bombay Sapphire and martini glasses the size of
candy dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Steaks and chops are difficult to foul up. A restaurant just
needs to track down thick, exceptional cuts and then keep a close
eye on the grill. Two of the offerings here were impressive,
particularly the filet mignon, which was perhaps 2 1/2 inches
thick, extraordinarily tender, lightly charred on the outside and
garnished with two roasted shallots.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the side dishes that distinguish this restaurant. Two
of the favorites at our table: a double-baked potato with truffle
cream and sauteed spinach (we were considerably less impressed with
the oven-roasted potatoes). Don't worry about feeling like a
Philistine if you ask to share an item; the restaurant expects it,
and in fact positions the side dishes family-style, in the center
of a table for two.
</P>
<P>
   The experience here was marred only by the wine manner of the
sommelier, who was tardy in producing a requested bottle of
Ravenswood merlot, then disappeared, opened the bottle at a
sideboard, poured some in a glass, sniffed it and tasted it. When I
protested that this should be my responsibility, he said, ``I
wanted to make sure it was good. Some people have had an entire
bottle not knowing that it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, when the steak arrived, it didn't have a bite out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two (two starters, two main courses, three side
dishes, a bottle of wine, a shared dessert, plus tax and tip) was
$180.
</P>
<P>
   ---French elegance
</P>
<P>
   Napa, a restaurant at the Rio, just west of the Strip, has one
feature that isn't easy to come by in the casino-bound restaurants
of Las Vegas: windows. Over dinner here, you can actually look out
over the pool and its bordering greenery, and watch the setting sun
fire the desert sky.
</P>
<P>
   The management of this hotel was among the pioneering element in
fine dining in Las Vegas, and this restaurant, the province of chef
Jean-Louis Palladin, is superb. It combines country French cookery
with an exhaustive wine list, often featuring more than 100
offerings by the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The room is seductively lit, with the walls adorned with
abstract art and the kitchen open to view. The service was
unfailingly attentive, yet discreet thankfully, no one conforms to
a popular restaurant trend of trying to be your best buddy (or,
worse, a stand-up comic) for two hours. The waiters are trained not
to reach across your body to place a glass or a fork, and they
don't remove one person's empty plate while the other is still
eating (my wife says that practice always makes her feel as if
she's being pressured to hurry up).
</P>
<P>
   Lamb chops were cut thick two rib bones per chop and cooked
perfectly: Here, medium rare was actually medium rare, not rare, as
is common in so many restaurants these days. One of the main-course
specials was exquisitely rich: risotto sauteed in truffle butter
and cooked in truffle consomme, then served with Parmesan cheese
and Maryland lump crab and topped with shaved truffles. Four
different kinds of breads were offered during the first course,
including a warm brioche.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extensive wine-by-the-glass offerings, we were
able to complement our disparate dishes properly and also match
wines with courses. Dinner for two (two starters, two main courses,
three glasses of wine, one dessert, plus tax and tip) was $174.
</P>
<P>
   ---Belly up
</P>
<P>
   A whiplashing contrast to these restaurants and cafes was found
one morning deep in the bowels of the Sahara, at the northern,
not-so-chic extremity of the Strip. It was the classic casino
buffet: $4.99 for all the breakfast you could fork down.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost all. Posted signs warn that patrons will be limited
to a ``maximum two-hour dining experience.'' Five late-teen men in
line in front of us seemed crestfallen to receive this admonition.
(When we were pre-paying, one actually hollered to a comrade,
``Hey, Dan, gimme that nickel.'')
</P>
<P>
   This Vegas tradition is strictly for power eaters. It's not
unusual to see people gobbling items from their plates while
standing in line.
</P>
<P>
   The fare here was only a slight step up from a college dorm
cafeteria, and the place was thick with large families,
international travelers (we heard a great number of foreign
tongues) and budget seniors. Highlights: an outstanding selection
of fresh fruit (mostly ignored), an impressive array of doughnuts
(attacked mercilessly) and decent offerings from the omelet
station.
</P>
<P>
   ---Tres bon
</P>
<P>
   For a considerable step up in buffet fare, try one of the new
theme hotels. Sunday brunch at Paris Las Vegas' Le Village Buffet,
for example, was a pleasant surprise
</P>
<P>
   and reasonably priced at $21.95 per person, including
unexceptional champagne (it might be better to stick to orange
juice). This is obviously a popular feast; the wait was about 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The various stations are set up to roughly conform to various
regions in France mussels, scallop salad and a delightful seafood
quiche at Normandy, for example; prime rib and veal at Burgundy;
sausage at Alsace, etc.
</P>
<P>
   You can probably imagine the other choices: a crepe and waffle
bar, an omelet bar (it was billed as Alsace, but had more the feel
of Marriott), an impressive selection of cheeses (including cantal,
Camembert and a delicious Roquefort), king crab legs stacked nearly
to the ceiling and a decadent array of French pastries and
made-to-order bananas Foster at the dessert station.
</P>
<P>
   ---Just for fun
</P>
<P>
   The hope on this trip was to sample the intriguing WB Stage 16,
a new restaurant that promises re-created backdrops from Warner
Bros.' Burbank lot, including such film settings as ``Batman'' and
``Casablanca.'' The restaurant trumpeted a December opening, but in
the first week of January it was still under construction, and only
recently got around to its grand opening. It is located at the
star-crossed Venetian, which has been plagued by chronic
construction delays since its hurried opening last spring. (Rival
hotel officials have taken to calling it The Incompletion.)
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, we sought out the America Restaurant at New
York-New York. This is a fun place for kids -- it is big, open and
airy, with a giant relief map of the United States forming a canopy
for it all. Characteristics of each state are embedded in the
papier-mache map, and it's fun to peruse the stereotypes: cheese,
beer, cows and Harley-Davidsons in Wisconsin; cotton, Elvis, a
guitar in Tennessee; potatoes and a hunter (or is that a
survivalist?) in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The menu features an exhaustive array of lunchtime items,
ostensibly tied to regions of the country. There's an Oklahoma
chicken-fried steak, a Rhode Island traditional turkey dinner
(shouldn't that be Massachusetts?), a Betty Crocker tuna melt from
Minnesota, and of course, a Philadelphia cheesesteak sandwich. As
you might imagine, there were also half-pound all-American burgers,
with an impressive array of fixings. The children's menu alone has
eight items ($4.95 each, including a drink and ice cream).
</P>
<P>
   Kids sitting at tables nearby often contorted in their seats,
peered upward and asked questions about the vast geography lesson
overhead. Not a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday they'll be able to look at the southern reaches of
Nevada ... and spot an embedded knife and fork.
</P>

 VEGAS-FINE ART-LADN  
Las Veges gets artsy 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
With main story on culinary boom 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Eric Noland, Travel Editor
</P>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- Fine art and historical artifacts are among the
higher-brow diversions to be found on a restylized Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art was considered Steve Wynn's
folly when the Mirage Resorts boss launched the endeavor 16 months
ago, building the exhibit primarily around his personal collection.
But it since has proven to be an enormously popular attraction in
Las Vegas, requiring waits of up to two hours on weekends and
routinely welcoming museum tour groups from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rio, just off the Strip, a display of artifacts recovered
from the Titanic wreck site has also been a favorite of visitors.
As was the case last year, when the Rio built replicas of the
interior rooms of Russia's Peterhof Palace for a display of Czarist
treasures, the items are exhibited in a kind of you-are-there
format.
</P>
<P>
   Film buffs, meanwhile, might want to stop by the Luxor for an
IMAX presentation of ``Fantasia 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bellagio's art exhibit is located in a tastefully designed
gallery along a hallway near the hotel's convention rooms,
comfortingly removed from the crassness of the casino.
</P>
<P>
   According to the foreword of a companion book, Wynn caught the
impressionist bug while an undergraduate at the University of
Pennsylvania. But the collection is not confined to that school.
One of the more intriguing works is an example of Renaissance
portraiture by Rembrandt van Rijn, ``Portrait of a Man in a Red
Doublet.'' The highlights of the subject's face are so natural and
warm that you're tempted to whirl around to see if someone has
lifted a shade on a nearby window.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable works include Vincent van Gogh's ``Peasant Woman
Against a Background of Wheat,'' Edgar Degas' ``Dancer Taking a Bow
(The Prima Ballerina),'' Claude Monet's ``Water-Lily Pond With
Bridge,'' Pablo Picasso's ``Portrait of Dora Maar'' and
Pierre-Auguste Renoir's ``The Loge.'' Also displayed are paintings
by Manet, Pissarro, Gauguin and Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Alan Feldman noted that while some items in the
collection are rotated, ``80 to 90 percent stays the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said the exhibit rooms feature state-of-the-art
lighting, humidity-control and security systems. Any numbskull who
attempts to test the texture of oil on canvas will set off a
cacophony that will make the casino seem like a church vestibule by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Admission includes an exhaustive audio tour narrated by Wynn.
For some pieces, you might want to punch off the commentary before
it is finished, but at least there is an in-depth art-appreciation
opportunity for those who desire it. Visitors are advised to allow
an hour for a tour of the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The audio tour is also included for the Titanic exhibit at the
Rio. It's a fascinating way to view more than 200 relics -- which
range from the ship's instruments to hair brushes to entire steamer
trunks. At one point, you walk down a cabin hallway on the ship and
overhear voices behind the stateroom doors. They've also re-created
the ship's grand staircase, featured prominently in the recent
movie (your adolescent daughters might be disappointed that they're
not allowed to climb it to take a closer look at the clock).
</P>
<P>
   One of the most wrenching aspects of the exhibit is a listing of
the ship's passengers and crew, with the names of the dead
highlighted. It is here that you get a profound sense of how
emergency evacuation was a function of social status in 1912 -- a
disproportionate number of the survivors came from the first-class
list.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Any day now, I expect to answer the telephone and be greeted by
the unmistakable sound of someone tinkling in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   You may think that's silly or gross, but mark my words: Sooner
or later, people eager to find new ways to save time will conclude
that there's really no good reason they can't use the facilities
and talk to you on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it may already be happening, halfway around the world.
Some years ago, my wife and mother-in-law took a trip to China when
it was first opening its doors to Western tourists. The Chinese
chamber-of-commerce types had a fairly accurate notion of what
those of us on this end of the globe like in the way of creature
comforts. Sometimes, though, things got lost in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, there was the matter of the phone by the toilet.
My wife and her mom found just such a convenience in a hotel they
stayed in. Apparently, the people who ran the place believed we
Americans are so fond of yammering that we can't even go to the loo
without calling up someone we know to say toodle-oo.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I've begun thinking the Chinese are onto something.
There doesn't seem to be a limit to the lengths to which some of us
in the good ole U.S. of A. will go to free up more seconds in our
days.

   Auto makers, as you've probably heard, are manufacturing a line
of spiffy new vehicles equipped with Internet access. I might have
placed this item a bit farther down the list of priorities for
research and development, below _ say _ creating better fuel
mileage and finding a less crunchy type of metal. But apparently
there's a great consumer demand to surf and drive.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we'll be able to cruise down the road, talk on the cell
phone, comb our hair in the rearview mirror, munch on a Big Mac,
and have our e-mail _ ads and all _ read to us by a computerized
voice.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the exciting new ways we can save time.
Recently two companies, the ubiquitous Otis Elevators and an
upstart called Captive Network Inc., began installing Internet
screens in elevators in office buildings and hotels in several U.S.
cities. The plan is to go nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   No longer will we have to waste time trying not to make eye
contact with anyone else while we silently watch the little numbers
above the door. Now we can use those lost 30 seconds to check our
stocks, read a paragraph or two from the morning paper, or download
our e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, the greatest new timesaving innovation comes from
Southern California, where five McDonald's restaurants have joined
forces with a local transportation authority to devise a way for us
to breeze through drive-through windows without having to stop to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement makes use of antennae and little gizmos that
already enable drivers to travel on toll roads and have the tolls
automatically deducted from a pre-paid account. Now, folks can
place an order at a McDonald's window, pick up the bag at the next
window, and have the bill added to their gizmo, just like a toll.
</P>
<P>
   This, according to McDonald's, will shave 15 whole seconds off
the normal 131-second wait at a drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
   ``With today's lifestyles, everyone's on the go,'' McDonald's
spokesman Antonio Hernandez told Reuters news agency. ``If they can
omit any time having to wait in the drive-through line, they would
welcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled with the time I'm going
to save in my car, on elevators and in fast-food lines. In fact,
I've already figured out what to do with the extra _ what? _ 3 1/8
minutes: I'm looking for more ways to save time.
</P>
<P>
   At this very moment, in fact, I'm changing my cat's litter,
typing this column on a laptop strapped to the cat's back,
downloading my e-mail, dialing up a business contact in China to
purchase the U.S. rights to the toilet phone, and cleaning my oven.
</P>
<P>
   I already have a few ideas for an ad campaign for the toilet
phone: ``Give it a swirl! It's flush with time-saving
possibilities!'' and ``Finally, a merger of laboratory and
lavatory: Microsoft meets Angelsoft!'' and, of course, ``The
Commode-A-Phone: Reach out and flush someone!''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds stupid now. But when I strike it rich, don't
bother calling me to ask if you can invest. Especially if you're
using the bathroom. That would be disgusting.

ON THE WEB, MAGAZINE IS ALL THE BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of editor of Mothers Who Think site to Jennifer
Foote Sweeney; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buzz snakes through our culture like millennial mist. People and
institutions rise and fall on their ability to generate the stuff.
For more than a decade, Tina Brown was the fin de siecle queen of
buzz. As editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she and her
publications dominated table talk at All The Right Places.
</P>
<P>
   But today Brown is in eclipse. The latest pretender to her
throne is David Talbot, creator of Salon.com, the randy, San
Francisco-based online magazine. Talbot's house of buzz has cooked
up a daily gumbo of news and opinion, arguably hotter than anything
on the Internet. Anchored by outstanding cultural coverage, it
presents a sexed, edgy confection that attracts readers like moths
to a back porch light.
</P>
<P>
   And it has done so in cyberspace, not on the newsstand. ``Salon
is the first really successful new media site on the Net,'' says
media critic Jon Katz. ``It is the first to figure out how to fuse
content and interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Its craving for attention is matched by its penchant for
controversy. Salon is in the news for its lapses in judgment as
well as its scoops. Its writing, says Washington Post media critic
Howard Kurtz, ranges from superb to sophomoric. The editorial
product can be as uneven as it is insouciant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this unhinged approach has legs is unclear. ``Salon's
strength and weakness is that it takes all kinds of editorial
chances in an age when most publications are cautious and overly
polite,'' Kurtz says.
</P>
<P>
   When Salon is good, it is very good. Salon reporter Daniel
Forbes made headlines last month when he uncorked a story
documenting the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy's searching of network television scripts for antidrug
messages. It was a superior piece of journalism and a clean score
for Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Talbot ran a piece by Dan Savage, an
openly gay Seattle-based writer bent on giving then-presidential
candidate Gary Bauer the flu because of Bauer's antipathy toward
gays. Savage, who had come down with the virus, posed as a Bauer
volunteer in Iowa and fraudulently voted as a Republican there.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers howled about the piece, which they considered
beyond the pale even for Salon. Talbot printed a sampling of their
e-mail tirades along with an editor's note in which he stood by the
article without condoning what Savage claimed to have done. Today,
Talbot remains unchastened by l'affaire Savage: ``My only
difficulty was not to have put an editor's note on the piece when
it ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon, then, is the gifted adolescent who dazzles a crowd yet
forgets to clean up his room. And it couldn't care less about
criticism. ``There is no bad buzz,'' says David Weir, its
Washington bureau chief, updating P.T. Barnum's famous dictum.
``We're not The New York Times. We're not gatekeepers of what
should be published.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Salon's sense of propriety is elastic, its
pursuit of cheek singleminded. ``The primary reason Salon exists is
because of the frustration I felt by the confines of daily
journalism,'' explains Talbot, a former arts editor of the San
Francisco Examiner. ``It has become increasingly formulaic and
focus-group driven _ simply dull. I came of age with the gonzo
journalism of Hunter Thompson in Rolling Stone. It was risk-taking,
provocative journalism. We've done that here.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about that. Salon is still recovering from the
firestorm it created in 1998 over the story it ran, on the eve of
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, about a
34-year-old extramarital affair of House Judiciary Committee
chairman Henry Hyde. All 57 journalistic organizations that were
offered the story turned it down. Salon's Washington correspondent,
Jonathan Broder, left over Talbot's decision to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot was pilloried for leaky ethics and a pro-Clinton agenda.
There were bomb threats at the office and death threats at home. He
wrote at the time that ``ugly times call for ugly tactics'' and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is also a feast of guilty pleasures. It produces stories
as illicit in this earnest world as Godiva chocolates to a weight
watcher. High in this category are the 53 episodes of ``Nancy Chan:
Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl.'' This fictional romp catches with
a gimlet eye the lust in the Imperial City with chapters like
``Thighs Wide Shut.'' Salon also has a regular sex column. One
recent offering by Susie Bright titled ``The Randy Bellboy''
provided tips on how lonely female hotel guests can get serviced by
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbot also craves serious credentials. Salon's political
reportage, notably its award-winning work on the Whitewater
scandal, has been solid. Last summer, Weir opened a Washington
bureau that will soon have nine reporters. (There are 56 on the
editorial staff, 10 in New York and the rest in San Francisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Jake Tapper, its lead political reporter, provides a steady
stream of smart, wry coverage of the presidential campaign. The day
after the New Hampshire primary, while the rest of the media herd
focused on South Carolina, Anthony York had a strong piece
detailing how the arcane rules in the California primaries will
hinder the transfer of raw votes among independents for John McCain
and Bill Bradley into convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, sex trumps politics at Salon.
Grown-up discussion of it is Salon's long suit and is marbled
through the 11 Salon sites, which include Arts &AMP; Entertainment,
Books, Health &AMP; Body, Media, News, Politics2000, and, Technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest is Mothers Who Think, edited by Jennifer
Foote Sweeney, devoted to intelligent exploration of real life for
women with children. Two weeks ago, it ran a piece asking, ``Is
this child pornography?'' about the trend among photo labs to call
police over film of naked children in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot celebrates sex because no one else does. He considers it
an effective tool to distance Salon from online competitors. ``The
question for new media operations is: What do you do that no one
else does?'' he asks. ``Most publications in America can't answer
that effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But more fundamentally, Talbot chafes at the way sex is treated
in this country. ``The US is childish as a culture in dealing with
it,'' says Talbot, who wrote a book on the subject. ``It is treated
either in a snickering sophomoric way or a harrumphing prudish way.
I find that inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Weir, ``I can't think of a dinner party when sex doesn't
come up along with politics, books, and movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot started Salon in 1995 as a weekly cultural digest. Books
were its windows to the world. ``At the beginning, we concluded
that the focus on new ideas in arts and culture and politics tended
to emerge through books,'' Weir says. Salon's book section remains
a superior admixture of knowing reviews covering an eclectic range
of books and illuminating interviews with authors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Talbot realized that Salon could not survive as a
weekly given the speed of the Internet, and in February 1997 took
it daily. ``We realized that news drives traffic,'' Weir says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, news coverage mushroomed, driven by the elections
that year and seismic events like the death of Princess Diana that
drew huge spikes in readership. Talbot sees running room covering
the entertainment industry. Because publications like Entertainment
Weekly are owned by conglomerates, he argues, they will be less
likely to pursue aggressive investigations than the independent
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Salon had revenues of $6.2 million last year and expects to turn
a profit sometime next year. It raised $27 million in a public
offering and $15 million from private investors last year to pay
for its current hiring spree. But profits are elusive for dotcoms.
Buzz does not automatically morph into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot hopes to open a European operation based in London later
this year. CEO Michael O'Donnell is now in Europe talking to
institutional investors. He salivates over the $800 million worth
of online ads in the United Kingdom alone last year and remains
sanguine that an American operation can thrive in a cultural
collision with the Euros.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Salon sold 10 percent of itself last year
to Rainbow Media Holdings, the holding company for the Bravo
Network, the Independent Film Channel, and American Movie Classics.
It plans to air its own television show on Bravo in late summer.
Salon Radio, accessible on its home page, is also ramping up its
audio stream of talk and music to augment the online offerings. By
the end of the year, a reader will be able to hear Salon reporters,
reviewers, and columnists read their work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salon readership is soaring, according to its own
figures. It claims that 3.4 million people visited it in December,
up fivefold from the 650,000 during the previous December. Slate,
the more traditional online magazine of politics and commentary run
by former New Republic editor Michael Kinsley, disputes the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This food fight is based on dueling statistics. The industry
yardstick has been Media Metrix, the New York company that projects
totals based on a sample of users. By that measurement, Salon had
1.4 million in December; Slate had 900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salon says that the sample system grossly underestimates the
true numbers. As for Slate's charges? ``Sour grapes,'' says Patrick
Hurley, Salon's vice president for marketing. ``When's the last
time you heard someone talk about Slate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slate won't go around licking doorknobs,'' snaps Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   But it does advertise on Salon. Even more delicious for Salon
was CNN's refusal last year to air its television ad campaign on
the grounds that an online site was a direct competitor to the TV
network.
</P>
<P>
   Love that buzz. At the end of the day, though, Salon will rise
or fall on its credibility. ``Buzz is their ideology,'' Broder
says. ``Once the fascination in the Web ends, the old rules still
apply.''

   &UR; Aggressive Crickets &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What makes the elephant charge his tusk,  &LR;   &UR; In the misty mist
or the dusky dusk?  &LR;   &UR; What makes the muskrat guard his musk?
Courage! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowardly Lion, who posed those questions in ``The Wizard
of Oz,'' aggressive behavior was a function of just one thing,
which he sorely lacked. Scientists, however, know that it is not
that simple, and indeed, what makes animals aggressive is not fully
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Now German and American researchers, writing in Nature, have
provided new insight into aggression, at least among one species.
What puts the fight in crickets? Not courage, the researchers say,
but flight.
</P>
<P>
   Cricket fighting was a royal sport in ancient China and has
persisted in some Chinese cities and in Chinese communities
elsewhere. Gamblers bet on whether their insect will prevail in a
fight that involves fencing with antennas, locking mandibles and
wrestling. The losing cricket retreats, usually losing its will to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the gamblers know, a defeated cricket can regain its
aggressiveness if it is shaken in cupped hands and thrown into the
air a few times.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied this effect, showing that it was not
dependent on how long the insects were in the air, and not
transitory _ aggressiveness remained restored for hours. Other
stressful activity, like being tumbled in a rotating tube or
walking in a wind, had no effect.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that the specific motor pattern of
flying produces some kind of command in the nervous system that
resets aggression in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tiniest Chemical Sensor &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nanotubes, those cylindrical molecules of carbon atoms, are
steadily becoming much more than just a laboratory curiosity, as
researchers develop potential applications for them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest possible uses for nanotubes is as tiny
chemical sensors. Researchers at Stanford report in the journal
Science that they have used nanotubes to detect minute amounts of
gases quickly and at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used a single-walled nanotube, one in which just
a single layer of carbon atoms forms the cylinder walls. These
nanotubes are on the order of a billionth of a meter wide, and
about three-millionths of a meter long. The structure of the
molecule is such that it acts like a semiconductor if a charge is
placed across it. This quality is what makes it useful as a sensor.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the electrical resistance of the
nanotubes increased or decreased greatly when exposed to small
amounts of nitrogen dioxide or ammonia. Nitrogen dioxide is found
in car exhaust, among other sources, and gaseous ammonia is toxic,
so tiny devices capable of detecting these gases would serve a real
need.
</P>
<P>
   The nanotubes were more sensitive than existing sensors. They
also operated at room temperature. Most sensors currently used
require heating to at least 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Mighty Nanotube &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before sensors or other devices based on nanotubes can be
produced commercially, more has to be learned about the basic
properties of these molecules. Scientists at Washington University
in St. Louis have taken a step in that direction, determining for
the first time the force needed to break one by stretching.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in Science, used multiwalled nanotubes
consisting of 10 to 40 single-walled tubes nested inside each
other. The stretching occurs inside a scanning electron microscope,
and the electron beam is used to fuse the ends of the nanotube to
tiny cantilever tips that do the stretching.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said the force needed to break the nanotube was
many times greater than would be required to break a similar-sized
structure of steel, if it were possible to create one. Next up for
the researcher: to break a single-walled tube.

TEXAS SCHOOL HAS A DEVIL OF A TIME DEALING WITH `GOD' BANNER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Deep in the heart of the Bible Belt, a
religious confrontation has pitted East Texas pagans against
Christians over a banner at Stephen F. Austin State University.
</P>
<P>
   The sign, which came down last week but is scheduled for
resurrection in two weeks, unequivocally explains who controls the
state-funded university.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campus belongs to God,'' according to the banner strung
across Vista Drive, the main entrance leading to the administration
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Earth is the Lord's and everything in it, the world and
all who live in it,'' the sign continues, quoting Psalms 24:1.
</P>
<P>
   The banner has gone up during a spasm of campus religiosity
following a recent dispute over whether the school should sanction
a pagan society.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a small band of Wiccan students won approval for a
campus pagan society in what Student Government Association
president Sean Bradley said was the most heated issue of his 1 1/2
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote, 16-15, came after religious leaders opposed
including the pagans amid the roughly 180 student groups that vie
for about $50,000 in student fees each year. More than 12,000
students attend SFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hot, very hot last fall,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months, until after the first of the year, the dust
seemingly had settled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Jan. 18, chalk drawings were placed around the
University Center inviting students to pagan meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One, for example, had a blue pentacle, a five-pointed star used
in magic, with a tree growing out of it. Looking down was the eye
of Ra, the sun god of ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   A week and a half later, after the drawings had been scrubbed
from the sidewalks, Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship hung its banner
over the school entrance off North Street.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fellowship, which is associated with the
Assemblies of God, posted fliers around the campus and bought two
full-page ads in the campus newspaper with the same message: ``This
campus belongs to God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely is retaliation,'' said Sarah Hudson, founder
and president of the Pagan Students Alliance. ``We thought about
coming back with some kind of response, but there really doesn't
seem to be any reason to stir the pot any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Paschal, Assemblies of God campus minister, said there is
no connection between the banner and the pagan society. Alphi Chi
planned to make a big push for Christian awareness during the
spring semester, Paschal said, and the banner is part of the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He said Alphi Chi will put up the sign again in two weeks and
hopes to continue that through the semester.
</P>
<P>
   According to university rules, the sign can go up for 14 days,
must come down for two weeks and then can return for another 14
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a coincidence,'' Paschal said. ``Some feel like this
is a response to the pagans because of the timing. But this isn't a
slam against them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the banner has been criticized by some students and others
who believe it infringes on the constitutional separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absurd,'' said Jim Harrington, director of the
Austin-based Texas Civil Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a big problem using public facilities to endorse
religious beliefs for such a long period,'' he said. ``It's not
like allowing a free-speech area to be used for an hour. The
university is allowing the sign to stay up for 14 days.''
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman James Hoard said the school is allowing
students another constitutional right: freedom of speech. The
school allows any campus organization to use the banner space
across Vista Lane, as long as the message isn't threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want free speech to be exercised,'' Hoard said. ``If the
pagan group wants to put up a sign, and the location is available,
then it can.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
While last fall's debate over allowing the pagans a place on campus
was a big issue, the banner topic hasn't caused much of a stir.
</P>
<P>
   A satire by student newspaper columnist Justin Klatt called,
``God, SFA form divine merger'' sparked a small wave of
letter-writing, pro and con. And a group of Christian students
prayed for Klatt's soul.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, or so, this would have been a big issue on
campus,'' said political science professor Wayne Johnson, a
self-described campus activist for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the students aren't particularly excited about this
church-and-state issue,'' he said. ``The issues that concern them
most evolve around money, like grants and the stock market and jobs
in their future.''

BRAIN ABNORMALITY LINKED TO PATHOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask the average social scientist why people become criminals,
and the answer is apt to center on poverty and abuse, not brain
structure and neurochemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new study, appearing in the February issue of the
Archives of General Psychiatry, researchers report that 21 men with
antisocial personality disorder, a psychiatric diagnosis often
applied to people with a history of criminal behavior, and a
history of violence had subtle abnormalities in the structure of
the brain's frontal lobe.
</P>
<P>
   The abnormalities, the researchers found, distinguished the men
with the disorder from healthy subjects, as well as from subjects
who abused alcohol or drugs, or who suffered from other psychiatric
disorders like schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   When combined with the results of previous studies, write the
researchers, led by Dr. Adrian Raine, Robert Wright Professor of
Psychology at the University of Southern California, the findings
suggest ``that there is a significant brain basis to APD over and
above contributions from the psychosocial environment, and that
these neurobehavioral processes are relevant to understanding
violence in everyday society.''
</P>
<P>
   The official diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric
Association lists a variety of criteria for a diagnosis of
antisocial personality disorder, including ``a failure to conform
to socialwith respect to lawful behaviors,'' deceitfulness,
impulsiveness, reckless disregard for the safety of self or others,
lack of remorse and ``consistent irresponsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting the criteria for the disorder, subjects
in the study had a history of violent actions toward others, and
high scores on scales intended to measure psychopathic personality
traits.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of MRI scans, the researchers said, revealed that
the men with antisocial personality disorder had an 11 percent
reduction in the gray matter of the frontal lobe, compared with
normal subjects. Similar reductions were found when the men's brain
scans were compared with those of subjects suffering from drug or
alcohol abuse or other psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that though such differences are large,
they cannot be detected without complex analysis. The brain's
frontal lobe is intimately involved with responses to fear and
stress, as well as with planning and other aspects of cognition.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Raine said that while the study did not
entirely rule out the possibility that the brain differences were
produced by influences after birth, it was unlikely that abuse or
bad parenting could account for the reduction in brain volume.
</P>
<P>
   The men with antisocial personality disorder also exhibited
reduced physiological responses in a stressful situation, the
researchers found. Asked to prepare and deliver a speech ``about
their faults'' in front of a video camera, they had lower heart
rates and sweated less during the exercise than subjects in other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings, Raine and his colleagues suggested, could
indicate that as children, people with antisocial tendencies might
be less responsive to criticism or punishment, and ``hence become
predisposed to antisocial behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The subjects in the study were recruited from five temporary
employment agencies in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Raine said the findings build upon previous work indicating that
the frontal lobe may be linked to antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 PET scan study of murderers, for example, Raine and
his colleagues found abnormalities in the functioning of the
prefrontal cortex compared with a group of control subjects. And
Dr. Antonio Damasio, chairman of neurology at the University of
Iowa College of Medicine, and his colleagues have demonstrated that
patients with injuries to certain parts of the frontal lobe often
begin to exhibit antisocial behavior, becoming irresponsible,
untrustworthy and inappropriate in social situations.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Damasio called the
findings ``persuasive.'' But the results, he added, should not be
construed to mean that antisocial behavior is ``located'' in the
frontal lobe, but rather that the role of the prefrontal cortex is
part of a complex neural system involving many brain regions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hare, a professor of psychology at the University of
British Columbia and the author of ``Without Conscience: The
Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us,'' said the new study
was potentially important.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that in his view, true psychopaths are a subset of
those diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a category he
believes is so broad its utility is limited. ``People throw the
terms `psychopath' and `sociopath' around quite loosely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hare cautioned that although the findings in the frontal
lobe are suggestive, it is still not clear exactly what, if any,
connection reduced gray matter has to behavior.

PERSONAL HEALTH: I LOVE YOU, I ACCEPT YOU, NOW BEHAVE! 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

<P>
   ``I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change.'' The title of this
long-running off-Broadway show sums up the source of most marital
problems. All too often, the very characteristics that initially
attracted partners to one another or the disturbing behaviors that
at first were ignored or considered unimportant eventually become
marital sore points and the cause of repeated arguments and chronic
unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   Couples struggle to get one another to change _ to conform to
each other's needs and desires and definition of a more perfect
partner. ``Why don't you ...?'' ``Why can't you ...?'' ``Why aren't
you ...?'' and ``You're wrong ...'' are common pleas and criticisms
that are more likely to precipitate arguments than change. Anger,
accusations and attempts at coercion do not inspire compassion and
cooperation, and rarely do couples who use this approach succeed on
their own in exacting the desired changes.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who seek marital therapy before deciding to divorce
have considerably less than a 50-50 chance of achieving and
maintaining the changes that would make for a more peaceful union.
The primary focus of traditional therapy is to encourage both
partners to change their behavior so that they can enjoy each other
more and hurt each other less. Too often these deliberate changes
fail to result from a full appreciation for the other partner's
pain or perspective, and sooner or later the old irritating
behaviors re-emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``acceptance therapy,'' or, as it is technically called,
``integrative couples therapy.'' This novel concept, which grew out
of a therapist's disillusionment with traditional techniques, is
exhaustively described and illustrated in a new book,
``Reconcilable Differences'' (Guilford Publications, $23.95) by Dr.
Andrew Christensen and the late Dr. Neil S. Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   The two psychologists offer a slew of tools that couples can use
to reconcile their differences without the help of a therapist.
There are now some 50,000 marital therapists in the nation, but
with half of marriages doomed to fail, they are still in short
supply. Besides, the cost of therapy often makes professional aid
unattainable by those who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for any therapy to succeed in reviving a
relationship, there must be a desire on the part of both partners
to make a go of it. The approach of integrative therapy is that
rather than force change, partners should start by accepting each
other's differences and appreciating their individual
sensitivities. Instead of backing partners into a corner by
insisting on changes, this kind of understanding often leads to
uncoerced changes that are more lasting and more in tune with each
partner's core personality and behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   One virtue of the book is its utter realism, its repeated
warnings that one or another tactic may backfire, which are then
followed by new strategies. Christensen, a professor of psychology
at the University of California at Los Angeles, emphasizes that
their goal ``was not to oversimplify the process or give cookbook
recipes to solve every problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Institute of Mental Health has been
sufficiently impressed with the early results of integrative
couples therapy _ a pilot study had a success rate of 80 percent _
to award $3 million for a clinical trial involving about 150
couples. Half the couples will receive traditional therapy and the
other half the integrative approach. The outcome of the six to nine
months of treatment will be measured in terms of couple
satisfaction and stability of the union and the couples will be
followed for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea behind acceptance therapy is that acceptance of
another person's traits and behaviors often leads to compassion,
and when partners learn to use compassion in dealing with one
another, they tend to become more willing to let go of conflict and
even change the troubling behavior. The psychologists suggest that
partners in conflict work on accepting, even embracing, each
other's irritating behaviors and characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accept means to tolerate what you regard as an unpleasant
behavior, to understand its deeper meaning (and) see it in a larger
context,'' Christensen and Jacobson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance is most likely to emerge through understanding, so
the first step they recommend is to analyze the anatomy of an
argument by developing a story about an important relationship
problem that incorporates the perspectives of both partners,
identifies incompatibilities and vulnerabilities and describes how
each person copes and how the problem escalates into conflict. Then
go back over the story to see whether it focuses on differences
rather than defects, vulnerabilities rather than violations,
descriptions rather than judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your focus shifts from the offending actions of each of
you to the soft spots that are bruised by these actions, you may
come to a new understanding of each other, one that cuts angry
arguments short and over time brings you closer together,'' the
psychologists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, important thoughts and feelings about a conflict are
left unsaid, either because of a lack of awareness or a fear of
becoming vulnerable by disclosing them. ``Yet,'' the authors wrote,
``it is precisely these revelations that could alter the tone of
the discussion and perhaps elicit empathy between you.''
</P>
<P>
   When partners feel pressured to change, they tend to become
defensive and withdraw, the psychologists point out. But when
partners feel accepted and understood, they are more likely to
change willingly, often making more changes than requested. Even if
no change occurs, acceptance and compassion are likely to bring a
couple closer.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of acceptance may be the realization that what now
drives a person crazy about a partner is a characteristic that was
a source of the initial attraction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a woman who is timid and conservative may be drawn
to a man who is sociable and spontaneous. But with time and the
arrival of children, the husband's tendency to pursue social
activities that exclude his wife or to take risks the wife
considers dangerous and inconsiderate for a man with a family can
become a serious source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Another important feature of acceptance is to realize that
partners are not being deliberately mean. For example, when a
husband failed to tell his wife until the last moment that he was
going hiking for the weekend with his best friend, she became
furious over his inconsiderate behavior. But his intent was not to
hurt his wife. It was his way of avoiding an argument. To end a
vicious cycle of avoidance and hurt, the husband needed to
understand and accept his wife's sensitivity to feeling left out
and her difficulties in making plans of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, though, that acceptance has its limits. The
psychologists state emphatically that some behaviors _ like
physical and psychological abuse _ should never be accepted.

   &UR; Pinched Nerves &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is a pinched nerve, and what is it pinched between?
</P>
<P>
   A. A pinched, compressed or entrapped nerve can be surrounded by
swollen tissues or impinged upon by bony processes in many areas of
the body, according to The American Academy of Family Physicians
Family Health &AMP; Medical Guide (Word Publishing). The cause can be
injury, disease or even pregnancy. The result is pain, numbness,
tingling and weakness in the part of the body to which the nerve
normally carries impulses.
</P>
<P>
   One kind of nerve entrapment, carpal tunnel syndrome, is
produced in the wrist because of repetitive stress from movements
like typing; the resulting swollen tissues compress the median
nerve, which runs through a bony tunnel in the wrist called the
carpal tunnel. Similar problems can affect the ulnar nerve, which
runs through the elbow, and another nerve in the arm, the radial
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of sciatica results from compression of the sciatic
nerve, which runs down through the buttocks to the back of the leg.
The cause is often a herniated spinal disk; normally, this
gelatinous cushion with a tougher outer ring separates the
vertebrae, but injury can squeeze out the soft core so it puts
pressure on a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   A pinched tarsal nerve or plantar nerve can cause numbness in
the foot. Some other commonly compressed nerves include the femoral
nerve, which extends from pelvis to knee, and the peroneal nerve,
along the side of the leg.

<P>
   This is a story about a man and a bird. The man is Dr. Tom Cade,
admired for his vision, ingenuity, passion and persistence, who
defied naysayers and spearheaded the rescue of the bird.
</P>
<P>
   The bird is the peregrine falcon, admired for its power, speed,
nobility and hunting prowess, which 30 years ago was perched on the
brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Though, over all, conservationists say the war to save
endangered species is being lost, the rebounding of the peregrine
falcon is perhaps the most stunning success to date. The American
peregrine now has perhaps 2,000 wild pairs nesting in the United
States and Canada, up from 39 in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the 1900s drew to a close, the peregrine blithely flew
off the federal list of endangered species in what Secretary of the
Interior Bruce Babbitt called a ``spectacular'' moment for one of
America's great birds and the law that fostered its recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other endangered and threatened species whose demise
is the result of lost habitat, killings and other direct forms of
human disturbance, peregrines are not put off by people. Just give
them enough space to perform their swooping courtship displays and
spectacular high-speed dives to spear their prey and a good supply
of birds to fill their bellies and they will thrive almost
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Equally at home on skyscrapers and bridges as they are on
mountainside cliffs, peregrines have become celebrated denizens of
New York City, where they have a steady food supply of pigeons,
starlings and sparrows and no threat from predators like the great
horned owl.
</P>
<P>
   While not quite faster than a speeding bullet, the peregrine is
reputed to be nature's most remarkable flying hunter, capable of
diving at 200 miles an hour for a midair attack, knocking the prey
out with its terrifying talons, then swooping down to catch the
falling bird.
</P>
<P>
   The falcon is not the lone comeback bird _ the American bald
eagle has done well too and without direct human intervention _ but
experts say that if not for the likes of a Cade, an emeritus
professor of ornithology at Cornell University and founder of the
Peregrine Fund, the peregrine falcon might not have survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Cade inspired people all over the world,'' said Brian
Walton, who took up the peregrine's cause on the West Coast. ``He
made believers out of people that this could be done, the peregrine
could recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his infectious enthusiasm for the peregrine, Cade
managed to harness a huge cooperative venture, getting
universities, government agencies, industries, conservation groups
and the public to participate in its rescue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Cade began captive breeding of falcons in a huge
barn Cornell built for the purpose, there were no wild pairs of
breeding peregrines east of the Rockies and a pathetic few with
failing nests to the west. On Aug. 9, 1970, a New York Times
Magazine article, ``Death Comes to The Peregrine Falcon,'' lamented
a demise that many thought was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Cade, who said he had been fascinated by falcons from childhood
and who did his PhD dissertation on the peregrine and gyrafalcon in
Alaska, recalled that at first the peregrine's plight was
mistakenly attributed to overdevelopment, molestation by falconers,
collection of its brown speckled eggs by admirers and wanton
killing by people who simply did not like falcons.
</P>
<P>
   But at a conference at the University of Wisconsin in 1965,
experts realized that the crash of falcons was a worldwide problem,
and, as Rachel Carson suggested in ``The Silent Spring,'' DDT was
probably the main culprit.
</P>
<P>
   DDT is an organochloride compound that breaks down into DDE, a
highly persistent chemical that is stored in the fat of animals
that consume it, especially predators like peregrines that are at
the top of the food chain. DDE interferes with the deposition of
calcium in the shells of the birds' eggs, leaving them too fragile
to survive incubation by females weighing two or three pounds.
</P>
<P>
   When the rescue effort began, no one was sure falcons could be
bred on the large scale needed to restore them to their former
haunts. And, until DDT was banned in the United States in 1972,
there was little to be gained by reintroducing the bird into the
wild.
</P>
<P>
   As Stanley Temple, the wildlife ecologist at the University of
Wisconsin who helped direct the falcon reintroduction program while
a research associate at Cornell, recounted in 1980, ``First they
said, `You can't breed falcons in captivity.' We did it. Then it
was, `Well, if you can breed them in large numbers, you can't
reintroduce them into the wild'; `If you can reintroduce them into
the wild, they'll never survive'; `If they survive, they'll never
be able to form normal pair bonds'; `If they form pairs, they'll
never produce fertile eggs.' The peregrines have done all of those
things, and year by year the critics have fallen by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the breeding program at Cornell got off to a false start.
``We quickly learned that trying to unite wild adults was not the
way to do it,'' Cade said. ``They may have been too stressed by
captivity to mate.'' What did work was to take young birds from
Western and Northern peregrine nests and raise them together in
captivity in broods, to prevent them from imprinting on humans.
Then, when the birds reared in captivity reached sexual maturity,
at ages 2 to 4, they were paired in the Cornell breeding barn.
</P>
<P>
   The breeders also succeded with laboratory hatching of
thin-shelled eggs taken from the nests of wild birds. Cade and his
crew would remove the thin-shelled eggs and replace them with
artificial eggs made of plaster to maintain parental interest in
the breeding process. Then when the laboratory-incubated eggs
hatched, the chicks would be returned to their parents' nests.
</P>
<P>
   In the restoration project headed by Walton, coordinator of the
Predatory Bird Research Group at the University of California at
Santa Cruz, researchers sometimes removed thin-shelled eggs from a
nest and replaced them immediately with captive-bred young, which
the adult falcons readily accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Workers also added laboratory-hatched chicks to the nests of
falcons that managed to produce one or two of their own and removed
healthy eggs for laboratory hatching, prompting the adults to lay a
second clutch.
</P>
<P>
   But problems remained. Even now there are occasional egg shell
failures caused by DDT contamination from wintering grounds south
of the border and from still-hot dump sites here. Besides, DDT was
not the falcon's only enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, at least, the great horned owl has an insatiable
appetite for falcons, adults as well as nestlings, and the owl
population had increased where falcons once dwelled, like the
accessible cliffs in central New York state.
</P>
<P>
   This forced the rescuers to move above the owls' range in the
Adirondacks in northern New York and in the Green Mountains and
White Mountains of New England. They also turned to two unusual
environments for the falcon: coastal regions and cities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New York City is now home to far more breeding
falcons than any city in the world, and New York state has more
breeding pairs, 38 at last count, than any state east of the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting laboratory-hatched orphans back into the wild, a process
called hacking, was a daunting task. While still flightless, three
or four chicks were housed in a screen-protected box that was
erected on a high ledge, with a stove pipe extending from the top
of the cliff to the box so that humans could feed them unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Hack-box watchers, who did the job more for love than money,
were hired to monitor the birds 24 hours a day, seven days a week
and to drop food down the tube every day until the chicks were old
enough to fly and hunt for themselves. Unlike many other species,
falcons and other birds of prey do not need to be taught how to
hunt by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   After Cornell's early successes, in 1981 another captive
breeding project got under way, at the Raptor Center at the
University of Minnesota. Pat Redig, director of the Minnesota
center, recalled his frustrations in trying to repopulate the
cliffs along the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   With poles and other equipment supplied by Northern States
Power, hack boxes were erected on the adjacent sand dunes and the
birds moved on their own to the cliffs. But every one of six
nesting attempts made from 1984 to 1986 failed because of predation
by great horned owls.
</P>
<P>
   Even peregrines themselves proved troublesome. One aggressive
female dubbed ``Jaws'' would fly as far as four miles from her
aerie to harass young falcons as they tried to emerge from the
riverside boxes.
</P>
<P>
   So, with each new falcon introduction costing more than $2,000,
the Minnesota team decided to set up hack boxes on an office
building in downtown Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we moved to the city, we were successful beyond our
wildest dreams,'' Redig said. People and businesses contributed
money and time to the effort. And the birds thrived, with
Minneapolis pairs moving on their own as far as the Wacker Building
in Chicago and to a cliff on the north shore of Lake Superior.
Natural enough, since the name peregrine means wanderer.
</P>
<P>
   Urban peregrines have captivated their human neighbors, many of
whom admit they are addicted to watching their comings and goings.
A Minneapolis lawyer whose office faced a nest had to turn his desk
around so he could get his work done.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Carl R. Howard, who can see pairs that nest on the
Brooklyn Bridge from his downtown office, keeps a daily peregrine
diary during nesting season, recounting his observations in ``The
Urban Audubon,'' the newsletter of the New York City Audubon
Society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, restoring the original Eastern population of 250
nesting pairs of peregrines was considered an unlikely goal. But by
1998, there were at least 238 and counting, and throughout their
current range they are holding their own or increasing in number,
even though some are still being lost to thin egg shells, owls and
urban accidents with windows and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But in places like New York City, these emblems of avian
nobility have inspired great respect. For example, bridge repairs
and paint jobs are typically postponed until the fledglings have
left their rudimentary nesting sites, and not just because the
workers fear parental attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques developed for saving the peregrine are now being
applied to other species, including the Mauritius kestrel native to
an island in the Indian Ocean, the aplomado falcon that disappeared
from Texas in the early 1950s and the harpy eagle in Panama. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FALCON FACTS
</P>
<P>
   SIZE: The adult peregrine is a crow-sized bird, about 15 to 21
inches long with a wingspan of 36 to 44 inches, a hooked beak and
curved talons that can spear prey. Adult males weigh about one and
a half pounds, females more than two pounds.
</P>
<P>
   RANGE: Peregrines inhabit every continent except Antarctica, a
distribution rivaled only by the osprey and the raven.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED: A peregrine's cruising speed _ about 40 to 55 miles per
hour _ is matched by many birds, but its high-speed dives after
prey can exceed 200 miles an hour, which may make it the fastest
animal on earth.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTING: When it spots a potential meal, it partially folds back
its wings and plunges into its vertical power dive called a stoop.
Upon contact, it whacks its victim with its feet, a blow that is
often fatal. Prey that survive are killed by a toothlike projection
in the upper jaw that is used to dislocate the neck vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   MATING: A male peregrine normally requires about 10 square miles
of sky to perform its acrobatic courtship flight. Once birds are
three or four years old they begin producing viable eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The peregrine nests by making a shallow scrape in soil. On
cliffs, bridges and buildings, it commonly nests on fallen gravel.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESPAN: Half or more of hatchlings die in the first year of
life, but adult mortality is much lower _ about 10 percent to 15
percent a year. Their average life span is seven to eight years;
some have lived to 18.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTIONS: Although no longer on the federal list of
endangered species, the peregrine will continue to be protected by
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking, killing,
possession, transport or import of migratory birds, their eggs,
parts and nests without permission from the Department of the
Interior. The Peregrine Fund, at the World Center for Birds of Prey
near Boise, Idaho, has successfully bred, raised and released
peregrines.
</P>
<P>
   USES: There are 3,000 to 4,000 licensed falconers in the United
States who keep peregrines and hunt with them. Trained peregrines
have been used at airports to terrorize other birds that can
jeopardize aircraft.

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Top 10 reasons to skip ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' next
week.
</P>
<P>
   No. 10: David Letterman will return to ``Late Show With David
Letterman'' on Monday, giving CBS a potential bonanza in the last
days of the February ratings and relegating Leno to the pale
imitations list. Letterman will ease back into the routine, taping
two shows, maybe three, a week, until he's fully recovered from a
quintuple heart bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9: Letterman's first guest will be frequent ``Late Show''
contributor Regis Philbin, who was the last guest before Letterman
had the surgical procedure on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8: Depending on how he feels after the first taping (which
will be done this Friday), Letterman is expected to tape and air
his second show Wednesday, Feb. 23, with Julia Roberts as principal
guest.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7: While Letterman is building up his stamina, the show will
use guest hosts in his absence. Bill Cosby goes first, on Tuesday,
Feb. 22. Philbin will guest-host on Thursday, Feb. 24.

   No. 6: Dave is aching to get back, although executive producer
Rob Burnett says that, since the operation, Letterman has had to
give up his first love, the rodeo. Though calf-roping is out of his
life forever, Burnett says Letterman ``got a rare opportunity to
experience what it would be like not to do'' a late-night talk
show. ``Late Night'' has aired on CBS for seven seasons. Before
that, Letterman was on NBC for 11 seasons in the spot now occupied
by Conan O'Brien. ``The experience,'' Burnett says, ``has
absolutely made him miss the job.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 5: Guest hosts probably won't do Top 10 lists.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4: Letterman is in great shape, hiking a mile to a mile and
a half a day to get his strength back. Burnett says that one huge
benefit, according to Letterman, is that bypass surgery is now so
non-invasive that the surgeons actually went in through his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3: The possibility exists that, in the manner of Johnny
Carson when he hosted ``The Tonight Show,'' Letterman may choose to
do four nights a week and have a guest host do the fifth. ``Dave's
been on the air for 18 years now,'' Burnett said. ``Four nights a
week is a conversation that makes sense having whether or not this
(operation) would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 2: Carson himself might be a candidate for guest host, but
Burnett wouldn't bet on it. ``Dave is very fond of Johnny,'' he
said, ``but my guess is that Dave would feel uncomfortable imposing
on him.'' Carson underwent bupass surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1: Dave may cut back on the number of guests for a while,
going with just one person in the chair and then a musical act at
the bottom of the show. ``We often do that,'' Burnett said, ``in
particular after vacations or weekends, whenever there are times
Dave will have a lot to talk about. After five weeks of gathering
stories, I imagine Dave will have a lot to say.''

   &UR; PATTERNS: Slacker Jr.: Not So Bad, by Comparison &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Adults who like to think of America's young as a bunch of lazy,
cigarette-packing television addicts may be disappointed by a major
new study that finds that adolescents in the United States smoke
and watch television less than those in many other industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves lazy _ or, at least, sedentary _ and the
study, conducted by the World Health Organization, finds that
American teen-agers exercise less than their peers elsewhere. And
they eat more junk food.
</P>
<P>
   But American young people measure up rather well, certainly
better than they are depicted in much of the mass media, said Dr.
Mary Overpeck, an epidemiologist for the National Institutes of
Health, which ran the United States portion of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worry about our kids,'' Overpeck said. ``This report really
gives us perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time American officials took full part in the
study, conducted every four years and involving 120,000 adolescents
in 26 countries and regions. In this country, 15,000 children, ages
11, 13 and 15, were interviewed at schools, and the data from 5,000
of them were included in the international study.
</P>
<P>
   American children fared well, or at least in the middle, in at
least two respects. Eleven-year-olds tried cigarettes at about the
same rate as children in other countries. But the 15-year-old
Americans smoked less than their counterparts, ranking 24th of 28
in the daily rate of smoking (about 12 percent). The highest rates
were in Austria and France.
</P>
<P>
   American youths also watched a little less television than most
of their counterparts: 15-year-olds ranked 20th and 11-year-olds
ranked 6th.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NUTRITION: For Some, Vegan Diet Relieves PMS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Those who champion the low-fat vegetarian diet known as vegan
have long made broad health claims for the regimen. Now one of the
diet's biggest advocates is making a new claim; he says it can
greatly reduce menstrual pain and the symptoms of premenstrual
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the 33 women studied reported benefits, but most did,
said Neal D. Barnard, the diet's advocate and the president of the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which helped conduct
the study. ``In some of them, it was quite profound,'' Barnard
said.
</P>
<P>
   On average, researchers said, the women reported having pain one
and a half fewer days a month. The study, by Georgetown University
Medical Center researchers, appears this month in Obstetrics &AMP;
Gynecology.
</P>
<P>
   The vegan diet includes grains, vegetables, legumes and fruits,
but no animal products, which include dairy and eggs. Barnard said
those women who benefited saw improvements in a month.
</P>
<P>
   The women studied were divided into two groups. One ate a vegan
diet, and the other ate normally, but its members were given
placebos. The women then switched.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they had based the study on their theory
that if women reduced the fat in their diets, their bodies would
produce less prostaglandin, a chemical implicated in menstrual pain
that is made from fat traces stored in cell membranes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REACTIONS: When Alcohol Knocks You Off Your Feet &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Falling-down drunk, as the expression has it, is the kind of
condition that on its face would seem to require little in the way
of explanation. One drinks too much, one tries to stand up, one
does not succeed. The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, seeking
insights into broader questions about how the brain and the nervous
system control blood pressure and the heart, decided to study how
alcohol could knock people off their feet.
</P>
<P>
   They found that alcohol, combined with the stress caused when
one stood up, could cause a drop in blood pressure, even among
young people who drank a relatively moderate amount (two or three
beers an hour). And that, in turn, can lead to faintness. Their
findings appeared in the journal Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Under ordinary circumstances, when someone sands up, blood
vessels constrict, maintaining the blood pressure that keeps blood
pumping to the brain and organs. Alcohol seems to stop the blood
vessels from constricting normally, the researchers at Mayo and at
the University of Iowa found.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virend K. Somers, a Mayo cardiologist and co-author of the
study, said the researchers' only interest in alcohol was how it
illuminated the overall working of blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the message here is not whether or not people
should drink,'' Somers said. ``It's merely to understand what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSEQUENCES: An Ominous Obsession at Women's Gym &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Amanda J. Gruber, a Massachusetts psychiatrist, meets
with patients, the last thing she wants to do is discourage them
from exercising.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them to go to the gym and offers compelling reasons:
``It decreases depression. It decreases anxiety. It decreases the
risk of osteoporosis.'' Then, she adds a caution: ``Don't get
caught up in whole body-image thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gruber has found, many women do just that.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, she
reports that 50 of 75 weightlifters interviewed said they had used
potentially dangerous substances like anabolic steroids or
ephedrine. And many had eating and body-image disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers focused on women, most in the Boston area, who
had competed in at least one bodybuilding or fitness contest or who
said they lifted weights five or more days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five of those who admitted drug use said they had taken
steroids. Many reported side effects like kidney problems,
deepening voice, inappropriate hair growth and changes in
genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber, of McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard, said many
of the women felt that the side effects were simply the price they
paid to achieve athletic goals.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that 65 of those interviewed were extremely
dissatisfied with their bodies. Gruber said she had met
professionals who had become immersed in gym culture and taken jobs
as trainers to spend more time in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PREVENTION: Watching Gallstones Prepare for Attack &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By the time most gallstones make their painful presence known,
there are not always a lot of options. An estimated half a million
Americans a year, mostly women, end up having to have their
gallbladders removed in what is the most common operation in the
nation, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers using new, high-powered equipment report that
they have photographed gallstones as they form, raising hope that a
better understanding of their origins may help prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   The research was done at the Technion-Israel Institute of
Technology and is reported in the current issue of the journal
Hepatology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research aims to answer why and how gallstones form, so
that physicians can direct their efforts toward inhibiting the
process at the onset through medication and dietary changes,'' Dr.
Yeshayahi Talmon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, researchers looking into gallstone formation had to
rely a video-type technology with a relatively low resolution.
Using advanced cryo-transmission electron microscopy, they said,
they can see in thousand-fold greater detail.

<P>
   The weather on Jupiter seems always stormy. Lightning flashes
deep in the enveloping gas clouds. Eddies of atmospheric turbulence
bob along the margins of jet streams, feeding energy into titanic,
long-lived whirlpools.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderheads tower more than 30 miles above surrounding clouds,
and new observations reveal that moist heat rising in these stormy
updrafts probably supplies the energy driving most Jovian weather.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo
spacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have
concluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is
similar to that on Earth _ only more so _ but is generated by heat
from a completely different source: from deep in the planet, not
from sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists said the new findings, reported in the current
issue of the journal Nature, appeared to solve the mystery of how
Jupiter gets the energy for such a constantly stormy weather
system, although many questions remain unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   A team of astronomers led by Dr. Peter J. Gierasch of Cornell
University found the most telling evidence in images, from visible
and infrared light, of the south equatorial belt, a region west of
Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a seemingly permanent storm in the
southern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning was visible there before dawn. A few hours later, a
cluster of huge Earthlike storms developed there. The scientists
estimated that the vertical transport of heat by such storms
corresponded to the flux generated by the planet's internal heat
source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We therefore conclude that moist convection is a dominant
factor in converting heat flow into kinetic energy in the Jovian
atmosphere,'' Gierasch's group wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, a group led by Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the lightning
preceding the storms was a critical clue indicating the presence of
large amounts of water in the deep clouds. Nothing else, they
noted, could condense at depths of as much as 60 miles below the
upper layer of the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we can use lightning as a beacon that points to the place
where there are rapidly falling raindrops and rapidly rising air
columns _ a source of energy for the eddies,'' Ingersoll explained.
``The eddies, in turn, get pulled apart by shear flow and give up
their energy to these large-scale features. So ultimately, the
Great Red Spot gets its energy and stays alive by eating these
eddies.''
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, violent storms like hurricanes and cyclones are fueled
by the warm ocean. The water is heated by sunlight, which drives
all terrestrial weather. But Jupiter is 5 times farther from the
Sun than is Earth and sunlight is only 4 percent as strong there as
on Earth, not enough to generate the observed tempests.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long assumed that Jupiter's internal heat
somehow churns the thick atmosphere. Because of the heat reservoir
of highly compressed hydrogen at its core, the planet generates
nearly 70 percent more heat than it absorbs from the Sun. But how
did that heat rise from the depths to drive Jovian weather?
</P>
<P>
   Moist convection had been proposed as the mechanism, said Dr.
Alvin Seiff of the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.,
but there was no firm evidence until now.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying journal article, Seiff said the new research
represented ``a notable advance in our knowledge of Jupiter's
weather by demonstrating that moist convection occurs and
transports significant amounts of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``Much work remains for us to gain a broad
description of Jupiter's fluid behavior.'' One remaining
uncertainty is what circulation is like deeper below the outer
layers of the planet's thick clouds.

WHY MEN KILL WOMEN THEY LOVE

<P>
   They had little or nothing in common and in the normal course of
events, it is unlikely their worlds would ever have intersected.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen A. Roskot, 19, the daughter of middle class parents on
Long Island, was a star athlete on the Columbia University lacrosse
team. Marie Jean-Paul, 39, known to her friends as Carol, grew up
in Haiti, and worked as a nurse's aide at a hospital in Brooklyn.
Joy Thomas, 18, graduated from Mount Vernon High School in June and
was studying to be a teacher at Westchester Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the course of 48 hours, the lives of these three women
were abruptly and horribly linked together: they were, all three,
the targets of homicidal attacks by men with whom they had shared
intimate moments.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, Roskot's throat was slashed in her dormitory room
with a kitchen knife, apparently wielded by a former Columbia
student she had dated. The next morning in Brooklyn, Jean-Paul's
husband used a machete to cut his wife's throat, then doused her
body and set it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, shot in the head in Westchester hours later, lived, but
only through a stroke of luck: her former boyfriend's pistol
jammed. In all three cases, the men believed responsible for the
attacks committed suicide shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics collected by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 32 percent of the 3,419 women murdered in the United
States in 1998, the latest year for which data are available, died
at the hands of a husband, a former husband, a boyfriend or a
former boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of smaller, regional studies and the limitations of
the data gathering methods used by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, however, many experts believe that the true figure
is much higher, perhaps as much as 50 to 70 percent. In comparison,
4 percent of 10,606 male homicide victims in 1998 were killed by
current or former intimate partners.
</P>
<P>
   While homicide rates as a whole have sharply declined over the
past 20 years, and the rate at which men are murdered by intimate
partners along with them, rates for women, and particularly for
white women, have not declined as sharply, despite efforts by
police departments around the country to increase their response to
calls involving domestic violence. In some regions, New York City
for example, they have not gone down at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come close to affecting intimate partner violence
and homicide the way we have other kinds of violence and assault,''
said Dr. Susan Wilt, director of the New York City Department of
Health's Office of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. ``It
remains a shocking issue that this is the main reason that women
end up dead and that it occurs within the context of their home and
family, where they are supposed to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women worry when they go out,'' Wilt said. ``They should worry
when they stay in.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are men so much more likely to murder their partners than
women? Feminist scholars and domestic violence experts have long
contended that such crimes reflect a society where men feel
entitled to exercise power and control over women, and to use
physical violence when necessary to assert their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a culture that in many ways celebrates male
dominance and female submission, and that is in some ways the
definition of an erotic heterosexual relationship,'' said Sally
Goldfarb, an associate professor at Rutgers School of Law in
Camden, N.J., and an expert in family law.
</P>
<P>
   Some evolutionary psychologists who study spousal murders, like
Dr. Margo Wilson and Dr. Martin Daly at McMaster University in
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, also argue that men as a whole, rather
than individual men, are the problem. But they base this assertion
not on culture but on biology. Violence, they believe, may have
developed as a strategy for men to exert proprietary control over
women, and in particular over their reproductive capacities. Many
psychologists, in contrast, focus on the personality
characteristics and life histories that lead men to batter and
kill.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the validity of such views, social scientists have in
recent years begun to investigate homicides by intimate partners in
a much more systematic way, hoping to find ways to spot the
potential for lethal violence before it occurs, and to develop
better tactics for intervention.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from such studies is a picture as consistent as it
is discomforting. Many studies confirm, for example, that women are
at particular risk when they are in the process of leaving a
relationship, something long noted by domestic violence workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 293 women murdered by intimates in North Carolina
from 1991 to 1993, Dr. Beth Moracco of the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health and her colleagues found that 42
percent had been killed after they threatened separation, tried to
separate or had recently separated from their partners. In another
study, researchers found that of 551 intimate partner homicides in
Ontario from 1974 to 1990, 32 percent were committed in the context
of a separation; in another 11 percent, the killer believed that
the female partner was sexually unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   The period after a woman has left is often the most risky,
studies find. In a review of homicides in Chicago, for example,
Wilson and Daly found that 50 percent of the murders of wives by
their husbands took place within two months after a separation; 85
percent occurred within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The link between separation and murder is more than
incidental,'' Wilson and Daly observed in their study. ``Homicidal
husbands are often noted to have threatened to do exactly what they
did, should their wives ever leave them, and they often explain
their homicides as responses to the intolerable stimulus of the
wife's departure.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of emotion that leads men to kill women they once
loved is often evident in the crimes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a crime of rage,'' said Wilt, who has been
tracking homicides by intimate partners in New York City since
1990. ``There is a sense of `How dare you think you can live
without me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 379 women known to have been murdered by male intimates
in New York from 1990 to 1997, Wilt and her colleagues found, 46.7
percent were killed with guns, 26.6 percent were stabbed, 8.2
percent were bludgeoned, 7.9 percent were strangled, and 10.6
percent were killed by other means, including suffocation and being
pushed from a window or the top of a building.
</P>
<P>
   That women killed by a male partner are more likely to be
stabbed or strangled than those killed by someone less close to
them, Wilt said, reflects the emotional nature of the crime. ``When
you stab or strangle someone to death, it's a lot more intimate
than shooting them,'' Wilt said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Dutton, a psychologist at the University of British
Columbia who recently completed a study of 50 men in prison for the
murders of their wives, said that ``typically, the murder itself is
over-kill _ there is more done to the woman than is necessary to
kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said men who killed their wives or girlfriends tended to
fall into two categories. A minority, he said, are calculating
killers, whose motive is instrumental _ cashing in on an insurance
policy, for example. More common, he said, are killers who suffer
from severe personality disturbances. Such men, Dutton said, often
have a terror of being abandoned and express their dependency in
extreme jealousy and controlling behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on deep down is that they believe the woman is
leaving them and they can't live without her,'' he said. ``The
prospect of her leaving throws them into a downward spiral where
they feel like they are staring into the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, Dutton added, the murderer enters a ``dissociated,''
trancelike state after the killing. In one case, he said, a man
killed his wife and children in Berkeley, Calif., boarded a plane
for New York, and was picked up by the police at La Guardia Airport
still wearing his bloody clothes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when a woman is murdered, it appears to come out of
nowhere: Thomas G. Nelford, the Columbia dropout who is believed to
have killed Roskot, appears to have had no history of battering.
</P>
<P>
   More often, though, there were many portents of danger. Through
a study of completed and attempted murders of women by intimate
partners in 11 large and mid-size cities, a group of researchers,
led by Dr. Jacquelyn Campbell at Johns Hopkins University School of
Nursing, is trying to put together a list of risk factors for
lethal violence.
</P>
<P>
   The study is not yet completed, but Campbell and her colleagues
have published a small part of their findings and have posted some
preliminary findings on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The study reinforces the findings of other research. For
example, Campbell said in an interview, the researchers are finding
that the biggest risk factor is a history of violent behavior by
the man in the relationship. Of 250 women in the study who were
killed by current or former partners, 65 percent had been assaulted
by their partner in the past. Of the 200 victims of attempted
homicide, 72 percent had experienced a previous assault.
</P>
<P>
   Past stalking of the woman by her male partner, Campbell and her
colleagues found, also posed a significant risk, occurring in 69
percent of homicides and 84 percent of attempted homicides. When
the woman had separated from her partner, the frequency of stalking
rose to 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Campbell said, stalking occurred even when the
couple lived together. A man, for example, might show up
unexpectedly at his partner's workplace, beep her repeatedly on a
pager, demanding to know where she was, or telephone her dozens of
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Other predictors of lethal violence included an escalation in
the frequency or severity of physical abuse, attempts by the man to
choke the woman or to force her to have sex, the presence of a gun
in the house, the use of street drugs or the abuse of alcohol by
the man, verbal threats, and the woman's belief that her partner
was capable of killing her.
</P>
<P>
   A history of domestic violence is found less often in men who
kill themselves after killing their partners, Campbell said.
Studies indicate that about 25 percent of men who kill their
partners commit suicide afterward. Often, they do so with an equal
display of emotion: Jean-Paul's husband, for example, is believed
to have set himself on fire. The man police believe killed Roskot
threw himself in front of a subway train a few hours after her
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in the multicity study, men who tortured or killed
animals _ long thought to be a sign of potential danger _ were no
more likely to kill their partners. But Campbell cautioned: ``No
matter what the research says, what I say to women is, `If he does
something that is terribly frightening, be scared! If it makes the
hair stand up on the back of your neck, be scared!'''
</P>
<P>
   In one case she encountered, Campbell said, a man slit the
throat of his wife's favorite dog and left the dead pet in the
bathtub for her to find.
</P>
<P>
   What can women do to protect themselves? At least one study, by
the National Center for State Courts, of civil protection orders
issued in three jurisdictions, found that contrary to popular
belief, such orders are effective in the majority of cases, making
women feel safer and reducing incidents of violence. A court order
obtained by Thomas, the Westchester Community College student,
however, appears to have done her little good.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in most cases, by the time a court intervenes, the
woman's situation is already dire. For young women, said Goldfarb,
of Rutgers, an important preventive measure is to be alert for
signs that a man is potentially dangerous _ before the relationship
grows serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the same types of gestures or comments that we are
taught as young girls to view as romantic are, in fact, major
warning signs of a serious potential for domestic violence,''
Goldfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave as examples statements that might appear solicitous but
that in reality may indicate extreme jealousy or a controlling

or ``You only need me,'' or ``I can't breathe unless I'm near

   ``It may sound like Prince Charming,'' Goldfarb said. ``But in
reality that kind of possessiveness is designed to isolate a woman
from other sources of support in her life. It is a foreshadowing of
violence.''

&HT;     SOME DEMOCRATS WOULD PREFER BUSH AS GOP NOMINEE

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ California Democrats appear to favor Texas
Gov. George W. Bush as the rival to their party's nominee,
believing that Arizona Sen. John McCain would be a far more
formidable foe in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Party regulars interviewed at the state Democratic convention
over the weekend overwhelmingly said they would rather face Bush
than McCain, who beat Bush in the New Hampshire primary and has
made gains in South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary
this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain is a more formidable opponent,'' said Humberto
Lujan, 75, a longtime party activist who supports former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination. ``He appears to be
far more substantive than George W. Bush. I think we can blow all
kinds of holes in Bush, but that's a lot harder to do with
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats fear Bush's ability to raise money for his
campaign, party activists said McCain's background as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam and his image as a straight talker make him a
tougher potential foe for the eventual Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a war hero. How can you attack him for that?'' said Gene
Crabb, 73, a lifelong Democrat and retired Army master sergeant
from Modesto. Crabb said he watched some of the early Republican
debates in Iowa and New Hampshire and believed McCain was a
stronger debater with a better grasp of the issues than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Crabb, who supports Vice President Al Gore as the Democratic
nominee, said he thinks the vice president would fare better
against Bush. Bush, he said, is ``something of a political novice.
He's never been on the national stage before.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's surprising surge after winning the New Hampshire
primary on Feb. 1 has compelled Democrats and Republicans alike to
ponder the idea of McCain as the possible GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Bush and his supporters suggested that
Democrats in open primary states like New Hampshire were
mischievously crossing party lines to vote for McCain in the GOP
primary because he would be a weaker opponent in November. McCain
countered that the Bush camp's accusation ``flies in the face of
the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of California's Democratic Party, who are staying
neutral in the Bradley-Gore race, said they don't care who becomes
the Republican nominee. Both Bush and McCain are beatable, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have substantial liabilities,'' said state party
chairman Art Torres, who criticized both as anti-choice on
abortion, pro-gun and lax on environmental protections. ``They're
the Siamese twins of Republican ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders clearly are paying more attention to McCain
because he has moved up in polls in California and elsewhere. When
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., attacked Bush's abortion record as
Texas governor in a speech at the convention Saturday, she quickly
followed by criticizing McCain for casting 82 pro-life votes in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party strategist Bob Mulholland said McCain's
rise reminds voters of Bush's vulnerabilities as a candidate. And
if McCain wins in South Carolina, he could be seen as the new GOP
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins, Mulholland vows that the party will pound away on
issues such as abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Democrats are more focused on picking their own
nominee. Bradley and Gore both addressed the convention, but the
feeling among delegates was that Gore is a heavy favorite. A Field
Poll last week in California showed Gore leading Bradley 54 to 13
percent. The state primary is March 7.

 &HT;    For many with eating disorders, photographer's sessions a ray of
hope
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pecan tree outside photographer Holly Sasnett's
studio bears the marks of life _ knots, bumps, bulges,
discolorations from diseases and everyday wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that tree when the subjects she's capturing on
black and white film berate their own bodies for being too fat, too
flat, too this, too that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if the tree was perfectly straight and thin,'' she
tells them, ``it wouldn't be so pleasing to the eye. Imperfection,
if that's what you want to call it, is what makes the tree so
beautiful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Sasnett has photographed women who
suffer from a variety of eating disorders. Some are painfully thin
and recovering from anorexia. Others wrestle with compulsive
overeating or bulimia, throwing up after they eat.
</P>
<P>
   All are nude.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women loathe their bodies to the point of
self-mutilation. The decision to bare them at all, let alone to the
permanence of photographs, is a form of therapy that appears to be
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I've talked to has been totally transformed by it,''
says Dina Zeckhausen, a psychologist who specializes in counseling
people with eating disorders. She decided to try the photography
idea with clients after hearing about a similar project in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some don't necessarily love what they see at first,'' she
admits. ``But the women have been able to see themselves
differently or at least with more compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   The portraits that Sasnett calls ``Body Revisited'' will be on
display for the first time during Eating Disorders Awareness Week,
which features numerous art events and seminars through Feb. 26.
The presentations are coordinated by the Atlanta Anti-Eating
Disorders League that Zeckhausen founded three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, it's estimated that between 5 million to 10 million
women and 1 million men suffer from the eating disorders of
anorexia, bulimia or compulsive overeating. Anorexia, characterized
by intentional and significant weight loss, afflicts as many as one
in every 250 girls and young women. Of the sufferers, between 5
percent to 9 percent of them will die of starvation, cardiac arrest
or suicide, according to the American Psychiatric Association.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the disorder is rampant among girls in private
schools, Zeckhausen says. ``Media images are getting thinner and
thinner. Grocery stores are full of lite, non-fat, low-fat versions
of everything. Kids are bombarded with messages that fat is bad,''
she says. ``The pressure, especially at private schools, to be thin
is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some people have mistakenly assumed Sasnett suffers
anorexia because of her tiny dimensions ( 5'4'', 100 pounds; size 0
or 2) she says she just comes from a small, thin family, and that
she's never experienced any food obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My size does create a problem for some of these women,
though,'' says the 35-year-old Sasnett. ``I can see it in their
faces when they open the door and see me for the first time. It's
like, `Oh.'''
</P>
<P>
   A commercial freelance photographer and an Atlanta native,
Sasnett's usual work is shooting boardrooms and executives for
annual reports, brochures and catalogues of corporations and
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   For this undertaking, she has to be two-parts therapist,
one-part artist.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman is photographed individually in a safe environment;
sessions can last up to four hour for one session. One woman did
request a subsequent session one year later after she had lost 35
pounds. ``She cried and cried. It was still hard for her to look at
herself. But later she called and said she felt okay about them,''
Sasnett says.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting out her Hasselblad 2 1/4-inch medium format
camera, Sasnett talks to the women at length about their particular
eating disorders and which part of their body most bothers them.
Women can choose to leave their clothes on. Sasnett also takes
Polaroid shots throughout the session so women can see themselves
in the poses they choose.
</P>
<P>
   She also meets with the women to provide positive reinforcement
when viewing the developed film. That's important, Sasnett says, to
tune out the endless ``negative tape recordings'' that play in
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Sasnett charged $300 for the portrait sessions and
development of prints. But when she saw how much it benefitted the
women, she began offering the service for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money issue was an easy way for people not to do it,'' she
says. ``And after working with a few women and seeing how cathartic
it was for them, and after hearing their stories, it became part of
my heart, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasnett would like to publish a ``Body Revisited'' book that
would include the women's struggles in their own words.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, she decided to drop her original idea of using
shadowed faces, and now rarely shoots above the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women have shared so many stories with me. I feel
incredibly protective of them,'' she says. ``A lot of them are
sexual abuse survivors and many have abandonment issues. Some cut
on themselves, and many start apologizing for things even before
they begin to undress.''
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity also allows the portraits to be universal, Sasnett
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the purpose of not showing faces or heads is so people
can project their own thoughts and images on the photographs. Maybe
someone with an eating disorder who views them will think, `If
these women are strong enough to do this, maybe I should get help.'

ANACHRONISM _ YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 20)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. The word AT in
parentheses should be replaced by the symbol.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why don't you incorporate a running endnote feature on
anachronisms in movie scripts?'' suggests Hendrik Hertzberg, senior
editor of The New Yorker. (I tell him how to edit his magazine; he
tells me how to write my column. Our readers benefit mightily.)
</P>
<P>
   My anachronism file is limited to the classic example of
Cassius' mention of a clock striking in Shakespeare's ``Julius
Caesar,'' set in a time before clocks had been invented.
Fortunately, Hertzberg includes a specific example to enliven his
broad policy guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie art directors go to incredible lengths to make sure the
details are right in period films,'' he notes. ``Yet the dialogue
is often studded with ear-stinging anachronisms. I noticed this
most recently in the new Woody Allen movie about the 1930s jazz
guitarist Emmet Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a scene in ``Sweet and Lowdown'' in which the
actor Sean Penn is in a car with a group of black musicians; one of
them, after making an observation, adds, `` &UR; You know what I'm
sayin'? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase  &UR; you know what I'm saying? &LR; '' Hertzberg writes, ``a
substitute for  &UR; y'know?, &LR;  is a hip-hop coinage never heard before
the 1980s, I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Close, but no cigar. (That's probably a carnival phrase used
after a failure to ring a bell in a test of strength, but I wish I
had a citation, you know what I'm sayin'?)
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1978, it was noted in this space, ``The
summarized continuation, or indication of a continued series, has
long been a staple of kids' talk:  &UR; et cetera et cetera  &LR; was
followed by  &UR; blah-blah-blah  &LR; and more recently by  &UR; and all that
stuff &LR; ; the current locution is  &UR; you know what I'm saying? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   During the past generation, the meaning of the vogue phrase
changed from ``and similar examples'' to ``will you give me some
assurance, verbal or by some nonverbal signal, that you comprehend
at least part of what I have been trying to tell you?'' This new
meaning is also expressed as  &UR; y'unnerstan'?  &LR; but  &UR; you know what I'm
sayin'?  &LR; is far more prevalent, with 3,000 citations in the Dow
Jones database since that first one in print in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Texas columnist Joe Bob Briggs surveyed the range
of hot reassurance interrogations _ from the ubiquitous  &UR; you know
what I'm sayin' here?  &LR; to the older  &UR; you get my drift?  &LR; _ and
wondered, ``Did we go through some kind of national anxiety attack
where the entire population decided that nobody was listening?''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is also a form of white noise, or meaningless sound
to fill up a moment between phrases. When the British heavyweight
boxer Julius Francis was beaten decisively by Mike Tyson last
month, the human punching bag told an interviewer: ``I tried in
there,  &UR; you know what I'm sayin'? &LR;  I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the question was posed for hundreds of years, its
emergence in the popular culture in this meaningless sense was
surely, as Hertzberg believes, a phenomenon that began only a
generation ago. Its use in a film that is set in the 1930s is thus
an anachronism, a word rooted in Greek for ``error in chronology.''
</P>
<P>
   For those moviegoers who spot such ear-stingers, and whose
recourse until now was only to mutter, with Hamlet, ``The time is
out of joint: O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it
right,'' we now have a new department to bedevil screenwriters. The
address is Safire's Anachronisms, The New York Times Washington
Bureau, 1627 I St. NW, Washington, DC 20006 or
onlanguage(AT)nytimes.com if you're in a big hurry and can take an
impersonal response.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN THE ANTONYMIST
</P>
<P>
   Who wins the language maven's award for the most effective use
of semi-antonymy in the primary campaign to date? Push the
envelope, please.
</P>
<P>
   The winner is Sen. John McCain, for an apparently offhand
statement made aboard his campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express,
rolling through South Carolina. According to Edward Walsh of The
Washington Post, McCain said that among Republicans, he is ``not
trying to appeal to the  &UR; disaffected &LR; . I'm trying to appeal to the
 &UR; disenchanted &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference? Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disaffected &LR;  means ``ill disposed, unfriendly, inimical.'' The
core of the word is  &UR; affect &LR; , same as in  &UR; affection &LR; ; the usual
sense is ``to lose affection for.''
</P>
<P>
   A more extreme sense, used more in law and politics, is
``estranged; alienated; resentful; disloyal.'' Judge Learned Hand,
speaking to educators in 1952, deplored an atmosphere ``where
nonconformity with the accepted creed, political as well as
religious, is a mark of  &UR; disaffection &LR; .'' At a time when charges of
communism were being made, that word was carefully chosen to denote
a state just one step short of ``disloyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disenchanted &LR; , though not the opposite, is markedly different.
It evokes the ancient breaking of a magical spell, and is a
calibration stronger than ``disillusioned.'' In its verb form, to
 &UR; disenchant  &LR; means ``to free from an often false belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, McCain rejected any characterization of those Republicans
to whom he was appealing as ``unfriendly'' or ``disloyal'' to the
GOP; on the contrary, he saw these potential supporters as people
who were disillusioned with the current leadership _ let down by
political dealing _ but whom he could bring back into the fold,
their faith restored. A key meaning of  &UR; disenchant  &LR; is ``to restore
to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   This careful contradistinction of  &UR; disaffected  &LR; and
 &UR; disenchanted  &LR; could not have been conceived by McCain off the
cuff. I suspect a skillful speechwriter at work and hereby put my
dibs on the first interview if he or she makes it to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   There's a related word for that mystery ghost to think about:
 &UR; disenthrall &LR; . That poetic verb has a more active and positive
connotation than  &UR; disenchant  &LR; and has historic resonance; it was
last used in politics with great effect by Abraham Lincoln: ``As
our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must
 &UR; disenthrall  &LR; ourselves, and then we shall save our country.''

   Although some people have mistakenly assumed Sasnett suffers
anorexia because of her tiny dimensions ( 5'4'', 100 pounds; size 0
or 2) she says she just comes from a small, thin family, and that
she's never experienced any food obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My size does create a problem for some of these women,
though,'' says the 35-year-old Sasnett. ``I can see it in their
faces when they open the door and see me for the first time. It's
like, `Oh.'''
</P>
<P>
   A commercial freelance photographer and an Atlanta native,
Sasnett's usual work is shooting boardrooms and executives for
annual reports, brochures and catalogues of corporations and
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   For this undertaking, she has to be two-parts therapist,
one-part artist.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman is photographed individually in a safe environment;
sessions can last up to four hour for one session. One woman did
request a subsequent session one year later after she had lost 35
pounds. ``She cried and cried. It was still hard for her to look at
herself. But later she called and said she felt okay about them,''
Sasnett says.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting out her Hasselblad 2 1/4-inch medium format
camera, Sasnett talks to the women at length about their particular
eating disorders and which part of their body most bothers them.
Women can choose to leave their clothes on. Sasnett also takes
Polaroid shots throughout the session so women can see themselves
in the poses they choose.
</P>
<P>
   She also meets with the women to provide positive reinforcement
when viewing the developed film. That's important, Sasnett says, to
tune out the endless ``negative tape recordings'' that play in
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Sasnett charged $300 for the portrait sessions and
development of prints. But when she saw how much it benefitted the
women, she began offering the service for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money issue was an easy way for people not to do it,'' she
says. ``And after working with a few women and seeing how cathartic
it was for them, and after hearing their stories, it became part of
my heart, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasnett would like to publish a ``Body Revisited'' book that
would include the women's struggles in their own words.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, she decided to drop her original idea of using
shadowed faces, and now rarely shoots above the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women have shared so many stories with me. I feel
incredibly protective of them,'' she says. ``A lot of them are
sexual abuse survivors and many have abandonment issues. Some cut
on themselves, and many start apologizing for things even before
they begin to undress.''
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity also allows the portraits to be universal, Sasnett
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the purpose of not showing faces or heads is so people
can project their own thoughts and images on the photographs. Maybe
someone with an eating disorder who views them will think, `If
these women are strong enough to do this, maybe I should get help.'

Municipal bus fleets around the country have come under pressure to
switch to compressed natural gas as a way to reduce pollution, with
Los Angeles and other municipalities converting their whole fleets
to this technology. But New York City, which has enormous influence

search of a more personable, less antagonistic, less scripted time.
Indeed, there are whole days now when his entire candidacy revolves
not around issues like tax cuts or foreign policy but on questions
of how political campaigns should be waged. The senator's signature
drive to ban big money from politics is just the start of it.
McCain has announced unilaterally that he will no longer run

production from major oil producers. The price neared $30 in
mid-January and then slipped. But in the last week it made another
run, only to be held back, apparently, by comments from some OPEC
officials, who suggested that the major producers would decide to
increase production when they meet at the end of next month. But on
Monday there were several reports that put a damper on the prospect
of an OPEC production increase and the price of crude for March

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Bar-fightin' in the East Texas
woods
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A hilarious chapter in Larry McMurtry's 1970
novel, ``Moving On,'' recounts a Houston bar fight that begins with
a dispute over whether a bowl of chili contains a sufficient
serving of beans and ends with sustained gunfire by any number of
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I hired a Yankee reporter at the newspaper in my little
hometown of Lufkin, I'd make that bit of McMurtry writing required
reading for the newcomer _ and just short of a requirement, I'd
suggest he stay out of the local bars.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what we're talking about aren't bars like they have
back East. These are East Texas honky-tonks, where the honkies go
to get tonked.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of my favorite honky-tonk stories, not fiction like
McMurtry writes but true. (Everything I tell is always the truth,
or at least the way I remember it.)
</P>
<P>
   This fellow was an accountant, had called on a client in a
neighboring small town and was heading back home through a remote
portion of the Pineywoods when he decided to stop at a roadside
tavern for a few beers at late evening.
</P>
<P>
   He was dressed in a suit and tie, as accountants do, and most
likely the only recent customer so attired.
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting at the bar, sipping his suds and smoking a
cigarette when a quartet of log haulers, as grouchy as they were
grimy, arrived on the scene, their overalls soaked through with the
sweat of honest labor. No pencil pushers were they _ they pushed
down pine trees for a living.
</P>
<P>
   One of their number, in the process of lighting a cigarette
himself, reached over and snatched the closest ashtray on the bar,
the very ashtray that the accountant was tending.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at them, they looked at him. From that point, there
was probably nothing anybody could have done. Eye contact had been
made. Such are the prelims of honky-tonking's favorite contact
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The log haulers gathered in a booth. After a moment, the
accountant walked over, retrieved his ashtray and returned to the
bar. Not a word was spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Another moment passed and the ritual was repeated in reverse,
the ashtray trophy now back at the booth. Then, the accountant
stepped to the booth once again to claim what was rightfully his.
</P>
<P>
   But as he grabbed for the ashtray, a log hauler grabbed him by
his necktie, smashed his face into the table and then, rising to
the occasion, jerked him longways along the bar, scattering stools,
spilling their beer and his blood, along with his briefcase full of
papers inscribed with important numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant didn't distinguish himself, but neither did he
die trying. He lived to tell about it through fat, swollen lips the
following day, explaining his battered face to a friend at the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time I'll know better,'' he said, nodding his aching
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hope so,'' the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, before I go in, I'm taking off my necktie.''
</P>
<P>
   Moral to the story: At an East Texas honky-tonk, make sure they
check you at the door for dangerous weapons. If you don't have any,
they'll give you some.

<P>
   LONDON _ These are the pictures that ``X Files'' fans the world
over want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the latest in high-powered cameras, two
plane-spotters have blown a hole through the U.S.'s strictest
security and revealed detailed shots of the legendary Area 51.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've been abducted by aliens, ``The X Files'' is a
cult American TV series majoring in the paranormal. And Area 51 is
an ``above top secret'' base featuring in many of its storylines.
</P>
<P>
   So secret is the base that the U.S. government denies its
existence. But unlike ``The X Files,'' Area 51 is real.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures have provoked a red-hot reaction on the Internet
from aficionados of all things spooky. The base has given birth to
a legion of Area 51 enthusiasts embracing ufologists, conspiracy
geeks, plane-spotters and the plain mad.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is the site of germ and biological warfare tests,
citing reports that workers from the base have died of strange skin
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the remains of nine UFO crashes are kept there,
and rumors abound that it is home to the U.S. government's very own
flying-saucer program.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that Area 51 is a secret military facility
about 90 miles north of Las Vegas, hidden in the three-million-acre
Nellis Bombing and Gunnery Range.
</P>
<P>
   It was the site selected for the testing of the then-top-secret
U-2 spyplane in the mid-1950s. The U-2's successor, the SR-71
``Blackbird,'' and the F-117 stealth fighter, are both said to have
made their test flights there.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that the 4,000-mph Aurora spyplane is there have recently
been strengthened with a photo showing a large delta-winged
aircraft at the base.
</P>
<P>
   And sightings of ``UFOs'' are so frequent along the highway that
it has been redesignated ``Extraterrestrial Highway'' by the State
of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Area 51 is certainly suitable for a hypersonic aircraft, as it
has one of the longest runways in the world which, at six miles,
could land three space shuttles at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are not welcome. The perimeter is patrolled by armed
guards in Jeeps and helicopters. Signs warn to keep out of
restricted areas and state that ``the use of deadly force is
authorized.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the only part of the U.S. that cannot by law be
photographed from the air. But the power of modern camera
technology has made a nonsense of such distinctions, as has the
enthusiasm of the base-watchers and spyplane enthusiasts drawn to
the dry Groom Lake bed where the base is situated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pair of these ``Groomies'' who took the latest pictures
from a mountaintop 12 miles away _ having first evaded the base
security patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cooper of Aircraft Illustrated, the first magazine to
obtain the prints, said: ``These panoramic shots are by far the
most revealing done of the base so far.'' &QL;

TINY BEADS ALLOW CLOSE STUDY OF DNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The more biologists understand of living cells, the more
daunting seems the task of figuring out everything they do. The
average human cell is too small to be seen, yet at any moment up to
30,000 of its 100,000 genes may be flicking on or off, executing
the cell's housekeeping needs or responding to messages from other
cells.
</P>
<P>
   How can a machine so tiny and so intricate ever be analyzed? And
even if by prodigious effort one human cell were ever completely
understood, there are at least 200 different types in the human
body.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of a series of ever more ingenious methods _
techniques to splice genes, produce them in bulk and measure the
activity of individual genes _ has taught biologists not to
despair. Now a new technique may be about to join this array of
powerful tools, although it remains to be seen if its effectiveness
will match its conceptual elegance.
</P>
<P>
   The method, described in the Feb. 15 issue of Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, involves attaching very large sets of
DNA molecules, such as all of a cell's active genes, to invisibly
small plastic beads five microns (millionths of a meter) in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Once anchored to the beads, the genes can be compared, sorted
and even sequenced en masse, meaning the order of the DNA units on
each bead can be determined. Since thousands of genes are handled
at a time, the bead system can generate vast amounts of
information.
</P>
<P>
   The bead system operates on a test-tube scale, avoiding the
expensive machines and labor of conventional technology. And much
of the processing is done by interactions of the DNA itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Let the DNA work for us instead of us working for
the DNA,''' said Dr. Sydney Brenner, the inventor of the technique.
Brenner, a biologist, has been a major figure in efforts to
decipher the workings of the genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner's ideas have been put into practice by scientists at
Lynx Therapeutics, of Hayward, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. George Church, a DNA sequencing expert at
Harvard University, the new technology should in principle be far
cheaper than the conventional methods being used to decode the
entire human genetic inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Church said he did not know in practice how far advanced the new
method might be. ``The question is whether they have something
really amazing or whether they hit a little more trouble than they
thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Mazur, director of genomics and bioinformatics at
DuPont's agricultural division, which is using the new technology,
said work was going well and ``is giving us a global view of gene
expression in plants.'' As with most novel methods, there had been
``glitches,'' but the technique's inherent advantage was its
sensitivity to gene transcripts produced in small quantity, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Lynx's technology is to attach large sets of DNA
molecules _ which can be all of a cell's active genes, or all the
fragments of a genome _ to minuscule beads. The process exploits
the fact that DNA likes to exist in the form of a double-stranded
molecule, with the sequence of chemical letters in one strand
exactly matching a counterpart sequence in the other. Strands of
complementary sequence will bind tightly to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx's method for attaching the genes to beads is ingenious and
complicated, but in essence involves building up 32-letter
sequences of DNA on a set of beads. These sequences are known as
anti-tags. The counterpart tags are attached to the genes under
study.
</P>
<P>
   One use of the beads is to compare large sets of genes that
differ in only a few genes of interest, for example, those that are
active in the normal and cancerous versions of a cell.
</P>
<P>
   First, a library of beads is made containing all the active
genes from both types of cell. The bead-linked genes are then
rendered single-stranded so that each is ready to bind with its
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Single-stranded copies of genes are then obtained again from
both types of cell, but this time a red chemical dye is attached to
all the cancer cells' genes and a blue dye to those of the normal
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the beads, when exposed to the colored genes, will
attract both red and blue versions. But a few beads will capture
only red genes, which are those expressed just in the cancer cells,
and a few will bind only blue genes, which are those the cancer
cells have suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Though existing gene chips can also be used to track the
expression of genes, they require knowing in advance the DNA
sequence of the genes to be monitored. Brenner's method does not
depend on knowing any gene's structure, but captures almost all of
a cell's 30,000 or so active genes.
</P>
<P>
   The same method can be applied to searching for defective genes
that contribute to disease. The conventional approach, based on
searching for SNP's (pronounced ``snips''), or single nucleotide
polymorphisms, requires identifying some 100,000 SNP's across the
human genome, an extremely costly task. The bead method focuses
directly on the genes that differ between the normal and a diseased
population.
</P>
<P>
   When genes of interest have been isolated by the bead system,
the next step is to identify them. Brenner has invented a method
for sequencing all the genes on a set of beads in parallel, meaning
that all the beads are sequenced at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The method depends on adaptors that bind to a specific sequence
of the four DNA letters on the tail of each bead's gene. The
adaptors, of which there are 256 different kinds, are identified by
fluorescent probes, whose presence on the immobilized beads is
recorded by a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Four such cycles are required to identify the first 16 letters
in the tail of each gene. This is enough to identify every gene
whose DNA sequence is known and all genes once the human genome is
completed.

   LONDON _ These are the pictures that ``X Files'' fans the world
over want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the latest in high-powered cameras, two
plane-spotters have blown a hole through the U.S.'s strictest
security and revealed detailed shots of the legendary Area 51.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've been abducted by aliens, ``The X Files'' is a
cult American TV series majoring in the paranormal. And Area 51 is
an ``above top secret'' base featuring in many of its storylines.
</P>
<P>
   So secret is the base that the U.S. government denies its
existence. But unlike ``The X Files,'' Area 51 is real.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures have provoked a red-hot reaction on the Internet
from aficionados of all things spooky. The base has given birth to
a legion of Area 51 enthusiasts embracing ufologists, conspiracy
geeks, plane-spotters and the plain mad.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is the site of germ and biological warfare tests,
citing reports that workers from the base have died of strange skin
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the remains of nine UFO crashes are kept there,
and rumors abound that it is home to the U.S. government's very own
flying-saucer program.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that Area 51 is a secret military facility
about 90 miles north of Las Vegas, hidden in the three-million-acre
Nellis Bombing and Gunnery Range.
</P>
<P>
   It was the site selected for the testing of the then-top-secret
U-2 spyplane in the mid-1950s. The U-2's successor, the SR-71
``Blackbird,'' and the F-117 stealth fighter, are both said to have
made their test flights there.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that the 4,000-mph Aurora spyplane is there have recently
been strengthened with a photo showing a large delta-winged
aircraft at the base.
</P>
<P>
   And sightings of ``UFOs'' are so frequent along the highway that
it has been redesignated ``Extraterrestrial Highway'' by the State
of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Area 51 is certainly suitable for a hypersonic aircraft, as it
has one of the longest runways in the world which, at six miles,
could land three space shuttles at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are not welcome. The perimeter is patrolled by armed
guards in Jeeps and helicopters. Signs warn to keep out of
restricted areas and state that ``the use of deadly force is
authorized.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the only part of the U.S. that cannot by law be
photographed from the air. But the power of modern camera
technology has made a nonsense of such distinctions, as has the
enthusiasm of the base-watchers and spyplane enthusiasts drawn to
the dry Groom Lake bed where the base is situated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pair of these ``Groomies'' who took the latest pictures
from a mountaintop 12 miles away _ having first evaded the base
security patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cooper of Aircraft Illustrated, the first magazine to
obtain the prints, said: ``These panoramic shots are by far the
most revealing done of the base so far.'' &QL;

   &UR; Program provides mapping tools for business &LR;

</P>
<P>
   DeLorme, the company that publishes maps on CD-ROMs for home
users, is offering a mapping program for that lets businesses
generate mailing lists, locate customers and plan delivery routes.
</P>
<P>
   XMap Business carries a suggested retail price of $99.95 and
covers the entire United States on seven disks. Business users who
have customer data on ACT!, Goldmine, Microsoft Access, Excel or
other programs can import the data directly into the mapping
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xmap Business is the answer for our long-time customers who
have called on us to create mapping and data tools to assist them
in their business activities,'' said David DeLorme, chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a cost of just $99.95 for the entire U.S., they can not
only see their current and potential business geographically, but
they can mark out territories, create targeted mailing lists from
the program's built-in database, plan business travel and even make
maps to post on their Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLorme is marketing the software with professionals in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate brokers, for instance, can create customized maps of
neighborhoods and provide clients with driving routes between
properties. Owners of upscale stores can use the business database
to select business and residential addresses from geographic areas
with upper-income levels.
</P>
<P>
   The program, like Street Atlas USA and Topo USA 2.0, can be
loaded on a laptop computer and connected to a GPS receiver so the
user's exact location can be pinpointed on the map.
</P>
<P>
   The program is available for Windows computers running at 120
MHz or faster and with a minimum of 32 megabytes of RAM. The
program also requires 130 megabytes of hard disk space.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Smokers are inhaling a lethal cocktail of 600 additives
as well as nicotine every time they light up.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to disgust people into giving up, British Health
Secretary Alan Milburn has released for the first time the exact
makeup of a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Among additives used are acetone, used to make paint stripper;
ammonia, contained in toilet cleaners; butane, a form of lighter
fuel; and beta-naphthyl methylether, more commonly known as
mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers are also opening themselves to the risk of inhaling
hydrogen cyanide, the poison used in gas chambers, methanol, a
rocket fuel, arsenic and carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas in car
exhausts.
</P>
<P>
   Worryingly, given the fight against smoking among children,
various scents and sweeteners can also be used in cigarette
manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn has put an end to a clandestine deal said to have been
struck between Britain's Tories when in power and the tobacco
companies to suppress the information.
</P>
<P>
   He has posted on the British government's Department of Health
Web site the names of the 600 additives contained in popular brands
of cigarettes and the damaging by-products which they can produce
when lit.
</P>
<P>
   Milburn said details of the additives were supplied to the
health department by voluntary agreement in March 1997. But, to
date, the tobacco firms have refused to detail which additives are
used in which brand of cigarette, prompting the British government
to push them for further revelations.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also currently negotiating a European Union
directive which would make full disclosure of all additives in
cigarettes mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy comes in direct contrast to an agreement made
under the Tories to keep the information ``confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   John Carlisle, spokesman for the Tobacco Manufacturers
Association, denied there had ever been a secret deal not to
release the list of additives but admitted companies are reluctant
to publish details of additives in particular brands for commercial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``This information has been publicly available since
1995. The fact is no one has ever asked for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle claimed that 95 percent of all British cigarettes were
Virginia blend and contained no flavoring. He added: ``Remember
this is a government-approved list. If these things are harmful,
why hasn't the government removed them?''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Sandford, of the anti-smoking group Ash, said that
tobacco companies had been allowed to put additives in cigarettes
for 30 years without any public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``There was a conspiracy of silence over this list
and, unless we are now told what additives go into particular
brands, we will never be able to calculate how these cocktails of
chemicals affect people.'' &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been four years in the making, and cost
Microsoft something like $8 billion to produce. Now, Windows 2000,
the software giant's latest offering, is ready to make its debut.
</P>
<P>
   But will it sell? The question, for a company that is in a very
complex political, commercial and technological environment, is if
its new product will sell enough to justify the expense of its
development, and the expectations of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, can Windows 2000 underpin the company's
future as its management hopes? That question, more than the
antitrust case which the U.S. and state governments have brought,
may determine the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Though the launch of the new products has attracted less of the
hyperbole that was previously given to Windows 95, Microsoft will
spare no expense in trumpeting its latest baby at the Windows 2000
Expo in San Francisco and other worldwide launch events this
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 is a bet-the-ranch product for Microsoft,'' chief
financial officer John Connors told investors at a recent
conference. ``It is the fundamental core of our programming effort
for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has talked about increasing revenue growth from 18
to 25 percent, largely on the back of the new product.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's other products, like SQL Server and
Microsoft Exchange, depend on making Windows 2000 a success.
Indeed, in the future it isn't too much of an exaggeration to say
that the system is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware manufacturers are gearing up to cash in on its launch,
as is everybody else from retailers to the publishers of guides.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the money that will make investors look very hard
at the new product. It is two years over deadline, it is one of the
largest and most complex software projects ever, with more than 30
million lines of code, and it is in the market sector that the
company most needs to nail down, quickly and securely.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest in the family of Windows operating
systems. It is the heir to Windows NT, the company's professional
tool, and comprises four separate products: Windows 2000
Professional, for business desktops and laptops; Windows 2000
Server, a network operating system, and Windows 2000 Advanced
Server, targeted at e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year will come Windows 2000 Datacenter, aimed at
the high end of the business market.
</P>
<P>
   None of them is aimed primarily at home users now running
Windows 98 or 95; Windows Millennium, also due later this year, is
aimed at them. Indeed, upgrading from either to Windows 2000 is
problematic and some applications will not work.
</P>
<P>
   The higher up the market, the more competition Microsoft has. It
has been dogged by complaints about scalability _ the ability to
expand to handle larger tasks _ and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of instability that is irritating when doing a little
word processing and surfing the Web for fun is lethal for companies
which depend on the Internet for their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company has aimed to deliver greater reliability,
better performance and more support for newer technologies, and
from most of the product reviews seems to have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how quickly and to what degree its latest
offering is taken up.
</P>
<P>
   A study by World Research forecast that 40 percent of desktops
would use the software by January of next year. But another, by
Survey.com, estimated that MS would actually lose market share to
Unix in some key sectors _ especially servers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals, like Novell, Oracle and Sun, have used the
delays with Windows 2000 to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, while the programmers were slaving
away in Redmond, another system emerged: Linux, the open source
operating system with its roots in Unix which has been
commercialized by companies like Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's share of the server market more than doubled to 17
percent last year from 7 percent in 1997, while Windows NT remained
steady at 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the market has been basically content with the idea of
Windows 2000, but it had a scare at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm, said that one in
four corporations would run into problems with compatibility
between the new system and its existing software. Its advice was to
wait until the company has ironed out the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer, said that
Linux was gaining ground. ``We don't see a massive immediate
acceleration due to Windows 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither development told the market anything it didn't know, but
both emphasized Windows 2000 is anything but a sure thing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company faces other key strategic issues this year. There
are still some big questions about Windows Millennium, the consumer
operating system, with the latest reports indicating that the
company has scaled back some very large and ambitious plans to
something more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Me, as it is known, is itself a stopgap before the more
advanced product, code-named Whistler, which is due next year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Windows CE (for Consumer Electronics), its
operating system for handheld devices and set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A new version, CE 3.0 is also due this year, but it has been
relatively disappointing so far, and again, MS is by no means alone
in this market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's restructuring, and Bill Gates' shift earlier this
year, are part of a redrawing of Microsoft to adapt to what
analysts call the post-PC age: towards the higher end of the
market, the servers which make the Internet run, and the smaller
devices which power the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In both, Windows gives it a steady but by no means dominant
position, ironically, in view of the antitrust suit that is still
winding through the courts. The difference is that the antitrust
suit, fundamentally, focuses on the past, and on the company's
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The new questions are about its very soul, the technology that
has driven its dominance. &QL;

RUSSIAN TROOPS ORDER EVACUATION OF GROZNY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ The residents of Grozny faced a new trial
Monday: Russian commanders ordered the city sealed and its
population evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were instructed to turn away any civilians who tried to
return. Civilians who endured the war will be told to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Nikolai A. Zaitsev, a senior Interior Ministry officer
here, said the city has become too dangerous for its inhabitants.
It will be off-limits for two weeks while Interior Ministry troops
comb the city for weapons, unexploded bombs and booby-traps.
</P>
<P>
   But the move was also a precaution against rebel infiltration,
the Russian military conceded. And Monday, leaflets were
distributed in the city warning that militants were planning a
guerrilla campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement to Grozny will be restricted until March 1,'' Zaitsev
said, waving an order from the high command. ``Those civilians who
are already in the city will be gradually evacuated. There are
refugee camps, and if someone does not have permanent residence we
will send him there. We will provide transportation for those that
cannot walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan to quarantine and evacuate Grozny was a surprise to
shellshocked residents who only recently left their basement
shelters to try to rebuild their lives. The rebels were unable to
defy the Russian military, but many elderly people here said they
had no intention of obeying the authorities and heading out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a matter of civil disobedience. Many simply said they
have no place to resettle and little desire to end up in an
overcrowded refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not leaving,'' said Tamara N. Zheromyskaya, a 57-year-old
veterinarian. She said she was not well enough to travel and wanted
to stay with her son. Beyond that, she added, ``I have nowhere to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   To anyone but the stubborn residents hanging on, Grozny seems
beyond restoration. Some of the half-destroyed buildings are so
rickety that demolition teams have been blowing them up. Huge
explosions rock the city, sending dust billowing into the sky. With
each explosion, Grozny seems to melt into the earth as more of its
cityscape is erased.
</P>
<P>
   Looting has been a serious problem and law and order is just
being established. The first complement of pro-Russian Chechen
police arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aid convoys have begun to snake through the city, but
food and water are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of civilians who braved the war seem determined
to endure the peace. They do not have much: a one-room apartment,
perhaps, and maybe some furniture. But they are determined to hold
onto the little they have, despite the hazards.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty. Zaitsev said, for example, that Russian
soldiers had found 11,000 explosive devices in the last few weeks.
Some are booby traps laid by the departing rebels, he said. Others
are unexploded ordnance, like the 500-pound Russian bomb that was
found across from the militia in the Zavodskoi district.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fear of renewed fighting is another concern. After the fall of
Grozny, most of the fighting shifted to the south. The Russian
troops blazed a path of destruction as they chased the remnants of
the rebel force in Grozny through towns like Katyr-Yurt and
Shaami-Yurt. Trying to regain the initiative, the rebels briefly
took the town of Gekhi-Chu. After they left, Russian artillery
pounded the settlement, causing numerous civilian casualties,
according to Russian media reports from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets distributed in Grozny on Monday warned that the
militants might strike on Feb. 23, the anniversary of Stalin's
attempt to deport the Chechen people to Kazakhstan. Stalin's move
was eventually reversed by Nikita Khrushchev, but not before it
fanned the rancor between the Russians and many Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commanders of the illegal armed formations want to draw
your towns, settlements and streets into the chaos of war and
violence,'' the leaflets read. ``Stay quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Akhmed Khizriyev, a 47-year-old construction engineer, and Asya,
his wife, fled during the war but returned to Grozny on Monday to
try to retrieve some of their belongings. They were surprised when
soldiers told them the checkpoints around the city were being
closed to prevent the militants from infiltrating and carrying out
partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of Russian forces in
the North Caucasus, drove the point home Monday in an appearance
before Russian television reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandits are sneaking through disguised as civilians in order
to take out their wounded who are still here and to strengthen
their positions in Grozny,'' Kazantsev said.
</P>

   Having suffered through several wars, however, Grozny residents
seem more concerned about the Russian evacuation plan than the
possibility of more fighting. They do not want to part with what is
left of their home or end up in a refugee camp.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been four years in the making, and cost
Microsoft something like $8 billion to produce. Now, Windows 2000,
the software giant's latest offering, is ready to make its debut.
</P>
<P>
   But will it sell? The question, for a company that is in a very
complex political, commercial and technological environment, is if
its new product will sell enough to justify the expense of its
development, and the expectations of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, can Windows 2000 underpin the company's
future as its management hopes? That question, more than the
antitrust case which the U.S. and state governments have brought,
may determine the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Though the launch of the new products has attracted less of the
hyperbole that was previously given to Windows 95, Microsoft will
spare no expense in trumpeting its latest baby at the Windows 2000
Expo in San Francisco and other worldwide launch events this
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 is a bet-the-ranch product for Microsoft,'' chief
financial officer John Connors told investors at a recent
conference. ``It is the fundamental core of our programming effort
for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has talked about increasing revenue growth from 18
to 25 percent, largely on the back of the new product.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's other products, like SQL Server and
Microsoft Exchange, depend on making Windows 2000 a success.
Indeed, in the future it isn't too much of an exaggeration to say
that the system is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware manufacturers are gearing up to cash in on its launch,
as is everybody else from retailers to the publishers of guides.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the money that will make investors look very hard
at the new product. It is two years over deadline, it is one of the
largest and most complex software projects ever, with more than 30
million lines of code, and it is in the market sector that the
company most needs to nail down, quickly and securely.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest in the family of Windows operating
systems. It is the heir to Windows NT, the company's professional
tool, and comprises four separate products: Windows 2000
Professional, for business desktops and laptops; Windows 2000
Server, a network operating system, and Windows 2000 Advanced
Server, targeted at e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year will come Windows 2000 Datacenter, aimed at
the high end of the business market.
</P>
<P>
   None of them is aimed primarily at home users now running
Windows 98 or 95; Windows Millennium, also due later this year, is
aimed at them. Indeed, upgrading from either to Windows 2000 is
problematic and some applications will not work.
</P>
<P>
   The higher up the market, the more competition Microsoft has. It
has been dogged by complaints about scalability _ the ability to
expand to handle larger tasks _ and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of instability that is irritating when doing a little
word processing and surfing the Web for fun is lethal for companies
which depend on the Internet for their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company has aimed to deliver greater reliability,
better performance and more support for newer technologies, and
from most of the product reviews seems to have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how quickly and to what degree its latest
offering is taken up.
</P>
<P>
   A study by World Research forecast that 40 percent of desktops
would use the software by January of next year. But another, by
Survey.com, estimated that MS would actually lose market share to
Unix in some key sectors _ especially servers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals, like Novell, Oracle and Sun, have used the
delays with Windows 2000 to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, while the programmers were slaving
away in Redmond, another system emerged: Linux, the open source
operating system with its roots in Unix which has been
commercialized by companies like Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's share of the server market more than doubled to 17
percent last year from 7 percent in 1997, while Windows NT remained
steady at 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the market has been basically content with the idea of
Windows 2000, but it had a scare at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm, said that one in
four corporations would run into problems with compatibility
between the new system and its existing software. Its advice was to
wait until the company has ironed out the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer, said that
Linux was gaining ground. ``We don't see a massive immediate
acceleration due to Windows 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither development told the market anything it didn't know, but
both emphasized Windows 2000 is anything but a sure thing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company faces other key strategic issues this year. There
are still some big questions about Windows Millennium, the consumer
operating system, with the latest reports indicating that the
company has scaled back some very large and ambitious plans to
something more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Me, as it is known, is itself a stopgap before the more
advanced product, code-named Whistler, which is due next year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Windows CE (for Consumer Electronics), its
operating system for handheld devices and set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A new version, CE 3.0 is also due this year, but it has been
relatively disappointing so far, and again, MS is by no means alone
in this market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's restructuring, and Bill Gates' shift earlier this
year, are part of a redrawing of Microsoft to adapt to what
analysts call the post-PC age: towards the higher end of the
market, the servers which make the Internet run, and the smaller
devices which power the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In both, Windows gives it a steady but by no means dominant
position, ironically, in view of the antitrust suit that is still
winding through the courts. The difference is that the antitrust
suit, fundamentally, focuses on the past, and on the company's
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The new questions are about its very soul, the technology that
has driven its dominance. &QL;

 By MARY DEJEVSKY  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lady may not bake cookies, but she tosses a
``mean'' salad and can even fry a ``great'' omelette _ just so
long, of course, as no eggs get broken.
</P>
<P>
   Such, it seems, are the minimum qualifications for a woman
seeking public office in equal-opportunity America at the start of
the 21st century. Ask Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   When Hillary Clinton _ sorry, Hillary Rodham Clinton _ was first
approached to run for the Senate, it looked a mad and ill-advised
idea, but you could understand the temptation and had to admire her
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   She may have been flattered into running and she was taking a
risk, but America likes a risk-taker _ and we women wished her God
Speed.
</P>
<P>
   Never having had a Margaret Thatcher, U.S. lawmakers could do
with a Hillary Clinton to shake their all too complacent
congressional chamber out of its torpor.
</P>
<P>
   If past performance is the measure, there is no doubt that in
Senator Clinton, the people of New York would have a tough, feisty
and intelligent woman standing up for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate political speaker in her student days, she can
still command a hall. A lawyer respected by her fellow
professionals in her mid-years, she has lost none of her sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the most popular first ladies on record, she has
travelled the world and overcome the most personal and political of
travails (Monica, impeachment and the Whitewater non-scandal) to
emerge forthright and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget her televised tour de force of loyalty and
political savvy when she defended her husband against the
``right-wing conspiracy'' in the early days of the Monica
allegations?
</P>
<P>
   It mattered not that she was, as it turned out, misguided in her
loyalty, and probably wrong in her charge of conspiracy. She was
dignified and magnificent. She had saved her husband's career
before, and her own, and would do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Half a year later, she was privately humiliated, but publicly
stoical, and hailed as a heroine across the land for doing exactly
what she had pledged not to do: stand by her man like some Tammy
Wynette.
</P>
<P>
   Small rebellions had attended her advance: that ``Rodham'' she
kept in her name, even in conservative Arkansas; those pantsuits
she settled on as her business attire; her solo travels abroad, and
now that move from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable, perhaps, was her retort, eight years ago, as the
then-presidential candidate's wife, that she had better things to
do as a professional woman than bake cookies.
</P>
<P>
   What a smashing of taboos was there; what a shock to cloistered
suburbia. She was Senate material even then.
</P>
<P>
   That Hillary, though, must have slipped out of the back door of
her new home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who stood in her three-quarter raincoat and sensible
shoes by the front gate on moving day was but a caricature.
</P>
<P>
   House-proud and pert, with conversation all of belongings and
shopping, this woman was no Senator-in-waiting. She had to be an
impostor.
</P>
<P>
   The substitution, to be sure, was gradual and stealthy. When the
tabloids told us that she had visited a renowned plastic surgeon
last summer, we did not want to believe it. Hillary Clinton would
not be so vain as to be diverted from her serious work by a few
facial wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the knife _ the best surgeons keep you guessing
_ she has changed: a new face, new makeup, new hair _ and a new
rack of pantsuits.
</P>
<P>
   It all shouts ``young,'' but ``young,'' alas, as all others look
young: a standardized, Stepford candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman who called herself Hillary _ no more Rodham, no
more Clinton _ finally made her Senate run official this month, the
substitution was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Who would elect a senator called Hillary? She wore oversized
pearls too crude even for her remade features. She spoke in the
singsong tones and false emphases of today's political
voice-trainers, and she pointed and jabbed with her hands, just as
the male politicians are taught to do.
</P>
<P>
   And if her style has been clipped, so have her causes. Where is
the woman who told Americans to their face that their lack of a
national health system was a disgrace to a civilized nation and she
wanted to do something about it?
</P>
<P>
   Where is the woman who embarrassed the Administration by
speaking out for a Palestinian state, because she believed it
inevitable, and right?
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's all schools and women and children: all very laudable
and all very safe.
</P>
<P>
   The old Hillary was a lifelong left-winger with a streak of
idealism; the new one calls herself a ``new Democrat,'' just like
her husband, and steers none too deftly the middle course between
government as the problem and as the solution.
</P>
<P>
   She has turned tough on crime and supports the death penalty.
And she is learning how to say nothing of consequence. She will not
even commit herself to sending that small Cuban boy back to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Hillary, you don't need the Florida vote, your husband
can't run for another term; you are not the vice president's
keeper. Just imagine that child was Chelsea and tell us what you
would do.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary, Hillary _ have you really let the consultants remake
you? Do you really believe that New Yorkers will prefer a
well-meaning suburban housewife to the independent woman you were?
</P>
<P>
   And if they did _ which would only confirm the lamentable
conformism of America's women _ is that the sort of senator you
would want to be? &QL;

 &HT;    Time takes a look at the 21st century
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one expects us to live like the Jetsons in the 21st century,
but some of the experts whom Time ($3.50) solicited for its
``Visions 21'' report foresee everything from underground houses to
electric cars in a world dominated by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cox staffers Priscilla Painton and Richard Zoglin edited
the collection of essays by people such as theater director Julie
Taymor, author Nicholas Lemann and musician Moby.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor predicts that live theater will still thrive in a society
of couch potatoes, Lemann foresees capitalists as the country's
next elite, and Moby expects compact discs to disappear and music
to be reproduced digitally on demand. Other predictions? Medical
breakthroughs will practically eliminate the need for makeup,
teenagers will disappear as children grow up faster, and kitchens
will become smaller as we get most of our food from the home-meal
industry. All will not be rosy, however: Novelist Mark Leyner
predicts that professional wrestling will be the single most
powerful influence on sports.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hefty reading: In a special 75th-anniversary double issue, The
New Yorker ($3.95) celebrates its past with a treasury of fine
writing. In a surprisingly favorable essay on Martha Stewart, Joan
Didion considers all of the criticism leveled at the style maven
and concludes that, instead of epitomizing the 1950s housewife,
Stewart actually represents the female pioneer spirit. ``The dreams
and the fears into which Martha Stewart taps are not of `feminine'
domesticity, but of female power, of the woman who sits down at the
table with the men and, still in her apron, walks away with the
chips.''
</P>
<P>
   Other entertaining reading includes Woody Allen's first piece of
fiction published in the magazine, in 1980, Roger Angell's memories
of growing up with a daring dad, Wendy Wasserstein's account of
midlife motherhood and 10 selections from great New Yorker writers
including E.B. White, James Baldwin, John Cheever, Janet Flanner
and Vladimir Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vanity fare: Yes, there is the predictable celebrity profile _
of Madonna and Rupert Everett _ in the March issue of Vanity Fair
($3.95), but, as usual, there are more substantial articles as
well. Sam Kashner's account of Natalie Wood's final hours, while
inconclusive, is compelling reading, as is Sam Tanenhaus' tale of
adultery and suicide at Hillsdale College.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Net loss: Last week, Yahoo, eBay and several other giants of
e-commerce were shut down by hackers. Can such hostile invasions be
stopped? Newsweek ($3.50) looks at the future of Internet
disruptions and follows the government's efforts to catch the
cybervandals. In a sidebar, Internet architect Bill Joy suggests
ways to keep from getting hacked: Don't open e-mail attachments
unless you know the source, he says, and use a hard-to-guess
password that contains a mixture of numbers and letters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No barriers: What happens when the doctor becomes the patient?
Biography ($2.99) offers an uplifting answer in a profile of Dr.
Alicia Conill, 42, a physician who was diagnosed with multiple
sclerosis more than 10 years ago. She had to give up her practice,
but she has since opened a nonprofit institute where those with
chronic illnesses and their caregivers are assigned roles and sent
on field trips in wheelchairs to learn what disabled people
encounter every day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Back in the saddle: Penelope Cruz, who stars opposite Matt
Damon in the upcoming film ``All the Pretty Horses,'' took her
debut American role seriously. According to GQ ($3), the Spanish
actress, who plays a wealthy Mexican ranch heiress, rode horses
five hours a day for weeks. Cruz even wore her Western outfit when
she went bowling.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lady may not bake cookies, but she tosses a
``mean'' salad and can even fry a ``great'' omelette _ just so
long, of course, as no eggs get broken.
</P>
<P>
   Such, it seems, are the minimum qualifications for a woman
seeking public office in equal-opportunity America at the start of
the 21st century. Ask Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   When Hillary Clinton _ sorry, Hillary Rodham Clinton _ was first
approached to run for the Senate, it looked a mad and ill-advised
idea, but you could understand the temptation and had to admire her
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   She may have been flattered into running and she was taking a
risk, but America likes a risk-taker _ and we women wished her God
Speed.
</P>
<P>
   Never having had a Margaret Thatcher, U.S. lawmakers could do
with a Hillary Clinton to shake their all too complacent
congressional chamber out of its torpor.
</P>
<P>
   If past performance is the measure, there is no doubt that in
Senator Clinton, the people of New York would have a tough, feisty
and intelligent woman standing up for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate political speaker in her student days, she can
still command a hall. A lawyer respected by her fellow
professionals in her mid-years, she has lost none of her sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the most popular first ladies on record, she has
travelled the world and overcome the most personal and political of
travails (Monica, impeachment and the Whitewater non-scandal) to
emerge forthright and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget her televised tour de force of loyalty and
political savvy when she defended her husband against the
``right-wing conspiracy'' in the early days of the Monica
allegations?
</P>
<P>
   It mattered not that she was, as it turned out, misguided in her
loyalty, and probably wrong in her charge of conspiracy. She was
dignified and magnificent. She had saved her husband's career
before, and her own, and would do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Half a year later, she was privately humiliated, but publicly
stoical, and hailed as a heroine across the land for doing exactly
what she had pledged not to do: stand by her man like some Tammy
Wynette.
</P>
<P>
   Small rebellions had attended her advance: that ``Rodham'' she
kept in her name, even in conservative Arkansas; those pantsuits
she settled on as her business attire; her solo travels abroad, and
now that move from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable, perhaps, was her retort, eight years ago, as the
then-presidential candidate's wife, that she had better things to
do as a professional woman than bake cookies.
</P>
<P>
   What a smashing of taboos was there; what a shock to cloistered
suburbia. She was Senate material even then.
</P>
<P>
   That Hillary, though, must have slipped out of the back door of
her new home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who stood in her three-quarter raincoat and sensible
shoes by the front gate on moving day was but a caricature.
</P>
<P>
   House-proud and pert, with conversation all of belongings and
shopping, this woman was no Senator-in-waiting. She had to be an
impostor.
</P>
<P>
   The substitution, to be sure, was gradual and stealthy. When the
tabloids told us that she had visited a renowned plastic surgeon
last summer, we did not want to believe it. Hillary Clinton would
not be so vain as to be diverted from her serious work by a few
facial wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the knife _ the best surgeons keep you guessing
_ she has changed: a new face, new makeup, new hair _ and a new
rack of pantsuits.
</P>
<P>
   It all shouts ``young,'' but ``young,'' alas, as all others look
young: a standardized, Stepford candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman who called herself Hillary _ no more Rodham, no
more Clinton _ finally made her Senate run official this month, the
substitution was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Who would elect a senator called Hillary? She wore oversized
pearls too crude even for her remade features. She spoke in the
singsong tones and false emphases of today's political
voice-trainers, and she pointed and jabbed with her hands, just as
the male politicians are taught to do.
</P>
<P>
   And if her style has been clipped, so have her causes. Where is
the woman who told Americans to their face that their lack of a
national health system was a disgrace to a civilized nation and she
wanted to do something about it?
</P>
<P>
   Where is the woman who embarrassed the Administration by
speaking out for a Palestinian state, because she believed it
inevitable, and right?
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's all schools and women and children: all very laudable
and all very safe.
</P>
<P>
   The old Hillary was a lifelong left-winger with a streak of
idealism; the new one calls herself a ``new Democrat,'' just like
her husband, and steers none too deftly the middle course between
government as the problem and as the solution.
</P>
<P>
   She has turned tough on crime and supports the death penalty.
And she is learning how to say nothing of consequence. She will not
even commit herself to sending that small Cuban boy back to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Hillary, you don't need the Florida vote, your husband
can't run for another term; you are not the vice president's
keeper. Just imagine that child was Chelsea and tell us what you
would do.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary, Hillary _ have you really let the consultants remake
you? Do you really believe that New Yorkers will prefer a
well-meaning suburban housewife to the independent woman you were?
</P>
<P>
   And if they did _ which would only confirm the lamentable
conformism of America's women _ is that the sort of senator you
would want to be? &QL;

FOSSIL HUNTERS UNCOVERING NEAR-COMPLETE FOSSIL OF JUVENILE T. REX
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by DINOSAUR FIND-INSIGHTS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was fossil fever, surely, that led him stumbling around the
Black Hills of South Dakota for six years, dodging snakes,
scorpions and prickly pear cactus spines on a relentless and
finally successful search for the bones of the most fearsome
dinosaur that ever stalked the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he hunted only for Tyrannosaurus rex, the
dinosaur that paleontologists say most captures the public
imagination for its ferocity, its scarcity and its guest
appearances in ``Jurassic Park'' and ``The Lost World: Jurassic
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 23 ``T. rex'' fossils have ever been found _ most in South
Dakota _ since the first was discovered in 1904. All are fossils of
adult rexes; most of the fossilized skeletons are not even halfway
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity of finding the almost-mythological beast inspired
self-taught bone hunter Kim Hollrah to look only for T. rex.
Through the 1990s, the Iowa native got to know Texans Ron Frithiof,
an Austin condominium developer and rancher, and Mike Harrell, a
Houston fossil trader, who were as enchanted by T. rex as he and
eventually became his partners.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollrah was alone in the heavily eroded black and gray hills
of western South Dakota that day in July 1998, the day that would
change their world.
</P>
<P>
   Following a tip from another fossil hunter, Hollrah walked along
the back expanses of a private ranch, his eyes toward the ground. A
claw from a T. rex appeared at his feet. It was raining and so
muddy that if he hadn't been watching, he would have stepped on it.
It could have stuck to the bottom of his shoe, so that at night,
when he took his shoes off and found it, he would have pulled his
hair out, saying ``Where? Where did this T. rex claw come from?''
It would have been maddening to be so close and miss it.
</P>
<P>
   The claw. It was obviously T. rex. But it was half the size of
the claw of a mature T. rex. He picked up the telephone and called
his partners in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a really hot lead here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What the three would eventually unearth is something never
before found. They located the first nearly complete fossil of a
juvenile T. rex and brought it home, where its jumble of bones is
being chipped out of earth that held it for millions of years. The
find stands to rewrite whole chapters of what we know about
dinosaurs and, possibly, make its discoverers multimillionaires in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The back story here goes very far back. It goes back 66 million
years, to the day of a violent death in the then near-tropical
bayous of South Dakota. Investigators say it may have happened like
this:
</P>
<P>
   A young T. rex is left alone in the nest. He's probably between
5 and 10 years old; no one in this day and age can tell. He weighs
just 1,500 pounds, far less than his 7,000-pound parents. He is 23
feet long and 10 feet tall. As such, he probably isn't strong
enough to go on the kinds of hunts that attract a grown T. rex.
</P>
<P>
   T. Mom is a killer at the top of the food chain, the meanest
animal in the bayou. In an Upper Cretaceous-period display of
family values, she drags parts of her kills back to the nest to
share with her youngster. She must have loved her boy (and later,
when his pelvic bone is examined, it is determined he is a boy).
</P>
<P>
   She may have begun to teach her kid rex how to hunt on earlier
trips. He has already broken a rib and had time for the bone to
reknit. Every T. rex found has been found with broken and healed
rib bones, probably the result of ramming into a kill or bashing
another T. rex for dominance or simply running too fast and falling
down.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex gulps his dinner of hadrosaurs, the duck-billed
dinosaur, a dinosaur large enough that only Mom or Dad could have
killed it.
</P>
<P>
   A T. rex has jaws that detach, somewhat like a snake's. He can
swallow large chunks of food. He has just chomped and swallowed a
whole hoof, one that will be found 66 million years later
compressed as if chewed, and also etched with stomach acid as if it
has been in the digestive track. The kid rex is apparently in
midmeal, with the remainder of his uneaten dino dinner scattered
around him.
</P>
<P>
   The scent of blood hangs in the swamp air. That's dangerous. T.
rex had an exceptionally large channel in his skull to carry
olfactory nerves, meaning the dinosaur likely had a highly
sensitive sense of smell. And T. rex dads may have been similar to
modern-day carnivorous animal dads. Like polar bears or lions, they
may have killed their young to get rid of any future competition
for food or mates.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex is attacked, possibly by his dad, and torn apart,
chewed up and spit out. Pieces of him are left stacked one atop
another, in far worse shape than the average Thanksgiving turkey
carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a suicide,'' Hollrah says, shaking his head over a
pile of bones that look as if they'd been carried around in a
garbage bag before they fossilized. ``This was a homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just a theory, of course. Maybe the kid rex was torn
apart after he had already choked on the duck-bill hoof and died.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he died first of a respiratory infection. Paleontologists

   But he did die. Eventually, his bones were covered up with

quickly, because bones that are covered quickly are the bones most

   What followed after Hollrah found the claw were leases and
lawyers and a $2,000 payment to the ranch owner to establish the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Hollrah, 40, Frithiof, 51, and Harrell, 36, sank shovels into
the hardened sandy loam above where dinosaurs once walked. T. rex
roamed the Canadian and American West, particularly the Rocky
Mountain region and south as far as the Big Bend region of Texas.
Other Tyrannosaurus lived in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota, on the fringe of the T. rex range, has proved to
be rich in fossil finds because of the large expanses of open
spaces where erosion has torn away layers of earth and time.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear to the team that this site held not just the
rarity of a juvenile T. rex, but also the rarity of a nearly
complete skeleton. Somewhere between 70 and 90 percent of the bones
were emerging. As they dug, they knew that they were on the brink
of something so astounding that it might be a good idea to call in
a well-known scientist who could help verify their find. They
needed the kiss of credibility from some big name in science.
Hollrah has a ninth-grade education, although he learned volumes
about fossils by reading and by making discoveries in the field.
Frithiof had been trading in fossils for only a few years, and this
was his first dig. Hollrah hiked to a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bakker, a Yale-educated scientist known as ``Bob the Bone
Hunter,'' picked up his telephone at his Boulder, Colo., home.
</P>
<P>
   The excited voice on the other end of the phone was calling from
near Belle Fourche, S.D. Bakker felt skepticism rising. It wasn't
likely that this fossil hunter had really found a nearly complete
fossil of a juvenile T. rex. Imagine the odds on that one. It would
be easier to win a lottery, Bakker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bakker booked a flight to South Dakota, and once there he was
stunned. But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me from between 7 to 7.5 seconds to recognize the
significance of the find.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The team wasn't halfway done digging out chunks of earth
containing bones when the winter of 1998 approached and the threat
of frozen ground caused them to stop. They decided to replant the
4-foot-deep dig with native vegetation and throw some cow chips
down to disguise the site. They dug trenches to keep water away.
What if there were a winter flood to damage the site? What if
freezing and thawing damaged the bones? After all, this kid rex was
a million-dollar baby they couldn't leave exposed to the South
Dakota winter.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1999, the kid rex bones were found to be
undisturbed. In all, the crew carried out 39 plaster-coated
packages of T. rex bones still surrounded by earth and shipped them
to Texas for further excavation. In the tradition of fossil
hunters, they gave a nickname to their kid rex. They called him
Tinker, after Frithiof's own childhood nickname.
</P>
<P>
   The bones were shipped to Harrell's Houston home. On the day
that a prefabricated shed arrived to serve as an excavation lab,
Harrell, only 36, died of a massive heart attack caused by a
pre-existing condition. His wife, Melody, today continues his work
as a partner in the kid rex team. She has to, she says. The kid rex
find was something her husband had called the pinnacle of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   So what now? The bones have been moved from Houston to a remote
Hill Country ranch for excavation. What does one do with T. rex
bones out in a shed behind the house?
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the McDonald's and Walt Disney corporations bought
another T. rex, Sue, an adult, for $8.4 million at an auction held
by Sotheby's in Manhattan. That skeleton was donated to the Field
Museum of Natural History in Chicago, with proceeds going mostly to
the private owner of the land where the fossil was found.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex is far more rare and presumably would carry a higher
price tag than Sue.
</P>
<P>
   The team that found the kid rex, however, isn't so sure yet what
it will do with the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Frithiof has had calls expressing interest in the dinosaur from
museums around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Frithiof is counting on what he says is a binding agreement with
the landowner to allow Kid Rex Inc. to keep its find and come up
with ways to share it with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may want to start our own nonprofit museum,'' Frithiof
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be worth more to keep it and cast it than to auction it
off,'' Frithiof says of Tinker's bones.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil hunters Alan and Robert Detrich, owners of a T. rex that
has been for sale on an Internet auction site (lycos.com), say a
good-quality T. rex fossil could bring in $40 million in annual
revenue to a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Frithiof figures they will likely make and sell full-size casts
of the fossil, and they are already positioned to make some money
with advertising on their new commercial Web site, www.kidrex.com.
The crew is posting photographs of Tinker's bones on its Web site
as each is cleaned, and the site is attracting advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Tinker may turn into a valuable learning tool, Hollrah says.
Inexperienced fossil hunters often go out looking for full
skeletons, laid out nicely as if the animal had lain down for a nap
and died. But Tinker was found as a jumble of bones. Hollrah wants
to make a cast showing how his bones lay in the site so students
can learn what to look for when hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Frithiof is out of the Austin real-estate business now. He's
devoting much of his time to the business of getting Tinker in
shape. The crew scrapes away earth, pulls out the old bones,
photographs them, and keeps logs of how they were found. Someday,
Tinker will be reassembled. Frithiof estimates it will take about
two years to clean the bones. They already have cleaned major
bones, including the skull, ribs, pelvis, legs and tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pieces from the snout to the tip of the tail and in
between,'' Frithiof says. They may have 90 percent of a juvenile
rex.
</P>
<P>
   His ranch outbuildings hold other fossils Kid Rex Inc. sells to
help finance their work.
</P>
<P>
   And Hollrah is no longer following his heart into the Black
Hills to pursue an enthusiasm that started in his youth, back in
1968 when he found his first fossil of a crinoid _ a small sea
creature _ one day while he was out fishing on an Iowa pond.
</P>
<P>
   Hollrah makes his home in Texas now, to be close to this kid
rex, to use a small paintbrush and dental picks and hand tools to
gently chip away time and reveal what he hopes will be more stories
about life long ago.

<P>
   The 1998 discovery of a juvenile T. rex by a partnership of two
Texans and an Iowa fossil hunter already is yielding new insight
into dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the kid rex adds weight to the theory that
rexes were warm-blooded hunters, not cold-blooded scavengers, as
paleontologists have long debated.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex had the same teeth as his parents. That means he ate
the same food, says paleontologist Robert Bakker, consultant to the
excavation project. That means adults were dragging food back to a
nest, because a juvenile would be too small to kill the same food
that its parents could.
</P>
<P>
   Animals that feed their young are hunters, not scavengers,
Bakker says. With a hungry mouth to feed, parents can't wait to
just happen upon some food. They have to be aggressive. Aggressive
hunters must be swift, regardless of climate. Aggressive hunters
are likely warm-blooded.
</P>
<P>
   T. rex laid eggs, like a bird, and had hollow bones like a bird.
Birds are warm-blooded. The new discoveries reinforce the argument
for a warm-blooded T. rex.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex discovery also has helped scientists look at the
dinosaur as an animal that established a sense of family, a social
structure not previously considered for T. rex, Bakker says.
</P>
<P>
   It has also helped scientists properly classify a type of
dinosaur. Before this kid rex was found, scientists thought perhaps
fossils of nanotyrannus were really young T. rex. Now, with the
discovery of the kid rex, they know that the nanotyrannus is really
a separate species.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the kid rex crew has discovered a fossil of what Bakker
says is a new species of carrion beetle that fed on the dead kid
rex. They named the beetle Jimmy, after the corporate lawyer who
came on board to help them incorporate as Kid Rex Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy the lawyer will not be offended to learn this, the crew
says.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Another dig
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas at Dallas geoscientists are leading a dig at
Big Bend National Park, where they expect to unearth one of the
largest dinosaurs, if not THE largest dinosaur, ever found in
Texas. The dig, suspended for the winter, has so far unearthed a
fossilized skeleton of a dinosaur neck about 30 feet long. One neck
vertebra uncovered weighed 470 pounds. The dinosaur may be an
Alamosaurus, scientists say, but if it is, they say it is far
larger than any of that species ever found. The site is not open to
the public.

FOSSIL HUNTERS UNCOVERING NEAR-COMPLETE FOSSIL OF JUVENILE T. REX
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by DINOSAUR FIND-INSIGHTS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was fossil fever, surely, that led him stumbling around the
Black Hills of South Dakota for six years, dodging snakes,
scorpions and prickly pear cactus spines on a relentless and
finally successful search for the bones of the most fearsome
dinosaur that ever stalked the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he hunted only for Tyrannosaurus rex, the
dinosaur that paleontologists say most captures the public
imagination for its ferocity, its scarcity and its guest
appearances in ``Jurassic Park'' and ``The Lost World: Jurassic
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 23 ``T. rex'' fossils have ever been found _ most in South
Dakota _ since the first was discovered in 1904. All are fossils of
adult rexes; most of the fossilized skeletons are not even halfway
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity of finding the almost-mythological beast inspired
self-taught bone hunter Kim Hollrah to look only for T. rex.
Through the 1990s, the Iowa native got to know Texans Ron Frithiof,
an Austin condominium developer and rancher, and Mike Harrell, a
Houston fossil trader, who were as enchanted by T. rex as he and
eventually became his partners.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollrah was alone in the heavily eroded black and gray hills
of western South Dakota that day in July 1998, the day that would
change their world.
</P>
<P>
   Following a tip from another fossil hunter, Hollrah walked along
the back expanses of a private ranch, his eyes toward the ground. A
claw from a T. rex appeared at his feet. It was raining and so
muddy that if he hadn't been watching, he would have stepped on it.
It could have stuck to the bottom of his shoe, so that at night,
when he took his shoes off and found it, he would have pulled his
hair out, saying ``Where? Where did this T. rex claw come from?''
It would have been maddening to be so close and miss it.
</P>
<P>
   The claw. It was obviously T. rex. But it was half the size of
the claw of a mature T. rex. He picked up the telephone and called
his partners in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a really hot lead here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What the three would eventually unearth is something never
before found. They located the first nearly complete fossil of a
juvenile T. rex and brought it home, where its jumble of bones is
being chipped out of earth that held it for millions of years. The
find stands to rewrite whole chapters of what we know about
dinosaurs and, possibly, make its discoverers multimillionaires in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The back story here goes very far back. It goes back 66 million
years, to the day of a violent death in the then near-tropical
bayous of South Dakota. Investigators say it may have happened like
this:
</P>
<P>
   A young T. rex is left alone in the nest. He's probably between
5 and 10 years old; no one in this day and age can tell. He weighs
just 1,500 pounds, far less than his 7,000-pound parents. He is 23
feet long and 10 feet tall. As such, he probably isn't strong
enough to go on the kinds of hunts that attract a grown T. rex.
</P>
<P>
   T. Mom is a killer at the top of the food chain, the meanest
animal in the bayou. In an Upper Cretaceous-period display of
family values, she drags parts of her kills back to the nest to
share with her youngster. She must have loved her boy (and later,
when his pelvic bone is examined, it is determined he is a boy).
</P>
<P>
   She may have begun to teach her kid rex how to hunt on earlier
trips. He has already broken a rib and had time for the bone to
reknit. Every T. rex found has been found with broken and healed
rib bones, probably the result of ramming into a kill or bashing
another T. rex for dominance or simply running too fast and falling
down.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex gulps his dinner of hadrosaurs, the duck-billed
dinosaur, a dinosaur large enough that only Mom or Dad could have
killed it.
</P>
<P>
   A T. rex has jaws that detach, somewhat like a snake's. He can
swallow large chunks of food. He has just chomped and swallowed a
whole hoof, one that will be found 66 million years later
compressed as if chewed, and also etched with stomach acid as if it
has been in the digestive track. The kid rex is apparently in
midmeal, with the remainder of his uneaten dino dinner scattered
around him.
</P>
<P>
   The scent of blood hangs in the swamp air. That's dangerous. T.
rex had an exceptionally large channel in his skull to carry
olfactory nerves, meaning the dinosaur likely had a highly
sensitive sense of smell. And T. rex dads may have been similar to
modern-day carnivorous animal dads. Like polar bears or lions, they
may have killed their young to get rid of any future competition
for food or mates.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex is attacked, possibly by his dad, and torn apart,
chewed up and spit out. Pieces of him are left stacked one atop
another, in far worse shape than the average Thanksgiving turkey
carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a suicide,'' Hollrah says, shaking his head over a
pile of bones that look as if they'd been carried around in a
garbage bag before they fossilized. ``This was a homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just a theory, of course. Maybe the kid rex was torn
apart after he had already choked on the duck-bill hoof and died.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he died first of a respiratory infection. Paleontologists
have several leading theories on what caused the extinction of
dinosaurs. Some believe an asteroid collided with the Earth,
causing mass dinosaur death. Others say migrating dinosaurs spread
diseases that rapidly infected and killed off the population.
</P>
<P>
   But he did die. Eventually, his bones were covered up with
leaves, and finally a sandy loam. The coverage might have happened

likely to fossilize and survive. It may have been a flood that
deposited earth and created a grave site undisturbed for millions

hunters must be swift, regardless of climate. Aggressive hunters
are likely warm-blooded.
</P>
<P>
   T. rex laid eggs, like a bird, and had hollow bones like a bird.
Birds are warm-blooded. The new discoveries reinforce the argument
for a warm-blooded T. rex.
</P>
<P>
   The kid rex discovery also has helped scientists look at the
dinosaur as an animal that established a sense of family, a social
structure not previously considered for T. rex, Bakker says.
</P>
<P>
   It has also helped scientists properly classify a type of
dinosaur. Before this kid rex was found, scientists thought perhaps
fossils of nanotyrannus were really young T. rex. Now, with the
discovery of the kid rex, they know that the nanotyrannus is really
a separate species.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the kid rex crew has discovered a fossil of what Bakker
says is a new species of carrion beetle that fed on the dead kid
rex. They named the beetle Jimmy, after the corporate lawyer who
came on board to help them incorporate as Kid Rex Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy the lawyer will not be offended to learn this, the crew
says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Another dig
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas at Dallas geoscientists are leading a dig at
Big Bend National Park, where they expect to unearth one of the
largest dinosaurs, if not THE largest dinosaur, ever found in
Texas. The dig, suspended for the winter, has so far unearthed a
fossilized skeleton of a dinosaur neck about 30 feet long. One neck
vertebra uncovered weighed 470 pounds. The dinosaur may be an
Alamosaurus, scientists say, but if it is, they say it is far
larger than any of that species ever found. The site is not open to
the public.

SPORTS SUPPORT: HOW TO CHOSE A GOOD SPORTS BRA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when sports bras were no big deal? You'd grab a cotton
halter-top bra at the store and hit the gym _ it was that simple.
But if you've shopped for one lately, you know that simplicity in
sports bras is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The options! There are heavy-duty super-compression models,
little-bitty Lycra tops with built-in shelf bras, bras with
racerbacks and zip-fronts, and microfiber performance tanks with
anti-chafing action. What is all this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   We asked some women's fitness experts that very question. Once
they're broken down and defined, the myriad options seem more
necessary and less daunting. Below, Sports Bras 101: What you need
to know before you drop any cash.
</P>
<P>
   1. WHY YOU NEED ONE
</P>
<P>
   Much of today's fancy workout gear is unnecessary; you don't
need to have special pants or a T-shirt with a swoosh to get a good
workout. But you really do need a special bra for working out _
without a sports bra, you run the risk of damaging your breasts.
And you need one no matter what your size, says Leigh Crews, a
Reebok master trainer and spokeswoman for the American Council on
Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a very small-breasted woman should still wear a sports
bra of some type,'' Crews says. ``Skin is very elastic, and if
you're doing any kind of impact activity, there's going to be
jarring _ whether you're big or small.''
</P>
<P>
   That can cause tissue breakdown and sagging. Fibrous materials
called Cooper's ligaments support the breast internally, and this
tissue is nonelastic; a sports bra prevents some of the jarring
that stretches the tissue and damages it permanently.
</P>
<P>
   2. KNOW WHAT YOU NEED
</P>
<P>
   Before you buy, consider two factors: your body and the type of
activity you'll be doing.
</P>
<P>
   One style doesn't fit all body types, so there are two major
types of sports bras: compression bras and encapsulation bras.
Compression bras are the most common _ they're designed ``to press
the breasts flat against the chest so they don't go anywhere,''
Crews says. Encapsulation bras are best for larger-busted women,
she says. These look less like halter tops and more like regular
bras _ some even have underwires _ but they provide much more
support than an everyday bra. Encapsulation bras harness each
breast individually instead of compressing your chest as a single
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Both types of bras should support you and limit motion as much
as possible without causing discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, consider how strenuous your exercise will be. ``It
needs to be really tailored to the activity that you're doing,''
says Shannon Forsythe, fitness coordinator for YMCA of Metropolitan
Fort Worth. ``If you're running, you're definitely going to want
something very supportive to be able to hold you.''
</P>
<P>
   When you try on a bra, test its capacity for motion control. Try
a few jumping jacks and you'll know what this bra is going to do
for you. To make it easier to decide, some brands offer styles with
varying degrees of motion control. Champion sports bras, for
instance, feature a rating system _ the tag tells you if the bra is
designed for strenuous or moderate activity.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel you need more support than sports bras offer, some
experts recommend wearing two compression bras at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's going to be recommended for bustier, heavier
(women),'' Forsythe says. ``Everything comes down to more
support.''
</P>
<P>
   3. MATTERS OF STYLE
</P>
<P>
   You can find bras with thick straps or thin straps, racerback
bras, scoop-back bras, tank tops with built-in shelf bras and more.
Nike alone makes about 20 types. There's not a single best kind, so
if you're confused, try on several styles and see what feels best.
</P>
<P>
   Read tags. Jump around in the dressing room. Wave your arms and
see what happens to the straps. All of this might take some time,
but there's no other way to find out which bra is best for you.
</P>
<P>
   A sports bra should be comfortable from the very beginning.
Motion control is important, but make sure the bra's not too
constricting. Take deep breaths and make sure the bra allows you to
breathe properly.
</P>
<P>
   4. SPECIAL MATERIALS
</P>
<P>
   Reebok has Hydromove, Nike offers Dri-Fit, Dupont produces
CoolMax, Adidas features ClimaLite. These special materials, mostly
nylon and polyester combinations, are designed to wick away
moisture and keep it from irritating your skin. Do they work?
Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wonderful fabrics, and they really do what they say
they're going to do,'' Crews says.
</P>
<P>
   An all-cotton bra doesn't handle moisture as well; cotton gets
soggy, and then you've got wet material against your skin. The new
materials absorb moisture and transport it to the surface, where it
can evaporate quickly. This prevents discomfort and skin
irritations.
</P>
<P>
   5. THE COST QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   At athletic stores, it's nearly impossible to get a good sports
bra for less than $25, and most of the newer, better models are $30
to $35. But you probably wouldn't think twice about spending twice
as much on a pair of shoes, and these are just as important.
</P>
<P>
   However, national chain stores such as Target or Wal-Mart will
often put their labels on bras that are almost identical to the
expensive brands. The materials are sometimes less expensive, but
the designs are the same. Look for these, and you often can get a
high-quality sports bra for less than half the cost.

 &HT;     By ERIN McCORMICK and JIM HERRON ZAMORA

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nobee Saeieo thought she was coming from
Thailand to the United States as a $240-a-month cook. Instead, she
said, she was forced to fix meals, give manicures and serve guests
on her knees, 18 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Dung, a 13-year-old from Vietnam, was sold to a
Silicon Valley executive, who planned to bring her here to satisfy
his sexual demands.
</P>
<P>
   These are just two of the 150 people who federal prosecutors say
have been victims of slavery or indentured servitude in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the largest landlord in Berkeley was charged with
importing teen-age girls from India for sex. Lakireddy Bali Reddy,
free on $10 million bail, has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled
to appear in court again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials say trade in slaves and indentured
servants in the United States is far from rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thriving. It's very well organized. It's very
lucrative,'' said Mark Riordan, head of Northern California
investigations for the federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ``These are situations where the poorest and least
sophisticated immigrants are being exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 50,000 women and children are brought to the United
States each year to be forced into prostitution, bonded sweatshop
labor and domestic servitude, a State Department official estimated
last year. Men also are used for forced labor, but to a lesser
degree, said Theresa Boar, head of the State Department's office
for international women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This modern day slave trade is appalling,'' said Rep.
Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., the sponsor of a bill that would
increase punishment for people who smuggle or keep indentured
workers in the United States. ``But even more appalling is the idea
that we know about it, have the ability to slow and stop it, and we
turn our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cases are studies in human cruelty:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1995, 76 Thai immigrants were rescued from a
cockroach-infested garment factory in Los Angeles County, where
they were held behind razor wire fences and forced to work 16 hours
a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, three men were convicted of charges that they
kidnapped a 22-year-old woman in China, brought her to the United
States and forced her to work as a prostitute. The men raped her,
beat her, burned her with cigarettes and tattooed her with a gang
symbol before she escaped from them in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1993, 240 starving, sick passengers from China were put
ashore by the freighter Pai Sheng beneath the Golden Gate Bridge.
Authorities believe the immigrants were on their way to garment
factory and restaurant jobs, where they would be compelled to work
off the $30,000 cost of their trips.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, authorities found nearly 100 deaf Mexicans who were
being held as slaves and forced to sell trinkets at street corners,
subways and bus terminals in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and
Charlotte, N.C. Two New York ringleaders were sentenced to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hae Jung Cho, who heads the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and
Trafficking, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization, said she
believes the vast majority of servitude cases in the United States
never come to the attention of the authorities. She said many
people do not get help because they do not know how to communicate
with authorities or they fear physical punishment or deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the thousands of cases that might be out there, we only see
a few,'' Cho said. ``These people are really afraid. No matter how
exploitative their situation is, they're still more afraid of the
INS.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations reports that around the world 4 million
people a year are traded against their will to work in a form of
servitude. The bulk of them come from Southeast Asia, Eastern
Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The countries where the State Department is focusing efforts to
stop human trafficking include Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, the
Philippines, Ukraine, Russia, the Czech Republic, Albania,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Jordan, who monitors trafficking for the International Human
Rights Law Group in Washington, said organized crime groups from
Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia have learned to make big profits
with little risk by dealing in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get caught trafficking drugs, you can be executed in
some countries,'' she said. ``But if you take a human being and you
threaten them and intimidate them, it's very safe. The punishment
is minimal. You can make a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indentured servitude is in part spawned by the high cost of
gaining entry into the United States, with immigrants from Asia
sometimes paying $40,000 or more to smugglers. Since few workers
from developing nations can afford such fees, immigrants will often
agree to work off their smuggling debts over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does a Chinese farmer get $40,000 to pay off a
smuggler?'' Riordan said. ``They may go in and work in a restaurant
for 10 years to pay off their debt.''
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Saeieo, 59, the cook from Thailand, was initially eager to come
to the United States to work. But what she experienced after her
employer brought her here in 1991 was nothing like the job she was
promised.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found that Saeieo was kept in indentured servitude by her
boss, Supawan Veerapol, a wealthy Thai woman. Veerapol brought
Saeieo to Southern California and forced her and other servants to
work long hours in her Thai restaurant and her posh Woodland Hills
home in Los Angeles County, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Saeieo testified, she was required to serve Veerapol's
party guests while crawling on her knees _ an ancient practice that
Thai royalty once imposed on servants.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors discovered Veerapol had tallied $85,000 in credit
card debt using the names of Saeieo and other servants.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after two of Veerapol's domestic workers escaped, the
employer was tried and convicted on charges of indentured
servitude, harboring illegal immigrants and using her workers'
signatures to falsely obtain credit. She was sentenced to eight
years in federal prison Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old Vietnamese girl, Dung, never made it to the
United States. But in an arrest warrant, federal prosecutors charge
that the Silicon Valley executive, Michael Rostoker, negotiated to
buy her from her family to bring her to the United States for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Rostoker went to Vietnam to ``marry'' Dung last April and was
trying to obtain a forged birth certificate showing she was 18 so
he could bring her back as his wife, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Rostoker was arrested in September as he prepared to board a
plane, allegedly on his way to get Dung. He is charged with
traveling to engage in sex with a minor and enticing someone under
18 into sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Rostoker, who pleaded not guilty, could not be reached for
comment. He is free on $2 million bail. His lawyers also declined
to be interviewed.

CAMPAIGN DILEMMA ENSNARES McCAIN 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Money in politics may be evil, as John McCain
has constantly tried to hammer home, but it is also the lifeblood
of a presidential campaign, as he very well knows.
</P>
<P>
   And no amount of rhetoric on the campaign stump has been able to
dislodge the inherent conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will be impossible to catch up in cash with George
W. Bush, the $68 million (and still counting) man, McCain,
nevertheless, will need to raise lots of money to keep his own
presidential race alive for many more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Winning New Hampshire's Republican primary was no small feat for
the Arizona senator. But remaining competitive is an even more
difficult task and _ if he survives this week's South Carolina
primary _ will require millions of dollars for advertising alone in
the more populous states, like California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   McCain began the year with only $1.5 million in the bank,
compared to $31.4 million that Bush had left over from the $68.7
million he had raised since last March. McCain qualified for an
additional $4.1 million in federal matching funds in January and
$1.7 million in February. Bush isn't accepting federal matching
funds for the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   So fund raising is crucial for the senator, who already has seen
a significant boost in funds _ by mortal standards, anyway _ since
his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's key fund-raisers from around the country were with him
in Nashua, N.H., when the New Hampshire returns came in, and they
wasted no time.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, even Bush supporters in Austin, including a
former member of the governor's staff, had received fund
solicitations from the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also saw an immediate increase in donations over the
Internet and went online with the first-ever ``cyberfund-raiser''
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared via satellite at simultaneous fund-raisers in
several cities, including Washington, last week. Paying tribute to
McCain _ the Senate committee chairman and veteran Washington
insider _ were many of the special interest lobbyists whom McCain _
the ``outsider'' candidate _ loves to bash for being a corruptive
influence on government.
</P>
<P>
   To be precise, McCain hasn't been campaigning against special
interest political contributions per se. The primary target of his
reform effort _ shot down in the U.S. Senate last fall _ was the
so-called ``soft money'' that wealthy individuals, businesses and
other special interests funnel to political candidates through the
major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   These contributions, which McCain has vowed to reject if he wins
the Republican nomination, circumvent limits on direct donations to
candidates for federal office and the ban on direct corporate
contributions to a candidate or officeholder. They provoked public
outrage with revelations that President Clinton had rewarded major
Democratic soft-money donors with overnight stays in the Lincoln
bedroom in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain loves to declare on the campaign trail that Clinton
``turned the White House into a Motel 6, and he was the bellhop!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has attacked Bush for not endorsing his reform
proposals and has painted the Texas governor as a defender of a
political system driven by big-monied special interests. Bush, in
turn, has accused McCain of being hypocritical for raising money
from the system that he bashes.
</P>
<P>
   Even a crusader like McCain _ no less than Bush or any other
officeholder or candidate who accepts special interest money, in
the soft or direct form _ can raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, for example, it was revealed that McCain, who
chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, wrote a letter urging the
Federal Communications Commission to act on a television station
purchase being sought by a company whose employees had contributed
$20,000 to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he did nothing wrong and only requested that the FCC
act on the application by Paxson Communications. He said he didn't
urge the commission to approve the sale.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We're all tainted because there is so much money
washing around, and that's an argument for campaign finance
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is. And we can all hope that McCain will continue
his reform efforts, either in the Senate or as president, should he
beat the odds and capture the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   But if most people aren't holding their breaths for real reform,
who can blame them?

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about a man and a bird. The man is Dr. Tom Cade,
admired for his vision, ingenuity, passion and persistence, who
defied naysayers and spearheaded the rescue of the bird.
</P>
<P>
   The bird is the peregrine falcon, admired for its power, speed,
nobility and hunting prowess, which 30 years ago was perched on the
brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Though, over all, conservationists say the war to save
endangered species is being lost, the rebounding of the peregrine
falcon is perhaps the most stunning success to date. The American
peregrine now has perhaps 2,000 wild pairs nesting in the United
States and Canada, up from 39 in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the 1900s drew to a close, the peregrine blithely flew
off the federal list of endangered species in what Secretary of the
Interior Bruce Babbitt called a ``spectacular'' moment for one of
America's great birds and the law that fostered its recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other endangered and threatened species whose demise
is the result of lost habitat, killings and other direct forms of
human disturbance, peregrines are not put off by people. Just give
them enough space to perform their swooping courtship displays and
spectacular high-speed dives to spear their prey and a good supply
of birds to fill their bellies and they will thrive almost
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Equally at home on skyscrapers and bridges as they are on
mountainside cliffs, peregrines have become celebrated denizens of
New York City, where they have a steady food supply of pigeons,
starlings and sparrows and no threat from predators like the great
horned owl.
</P>
<P>
   While not quite faster than a speeding bullet, the peregrine is
reputed to be nature's most remarkable flying hunter, capable of
diving at 200 miles an hour for a midair attack, knocking the prey
out with its terrifying talons, then swooping down to catch the
falling bird.
</P>
<P>
   The falcon is not the lone comeback bird _ the American bald
eagle has done well too and without direct human intervention _ but
experts say that if not for the likes of a Cade, an emeritus
professor of ornithology at Cornell University and founder of the
Peregrine Fund, the peregrine falcon might not have survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Cade inspired people all over the world,'' said Brian
Walton, who took up the peregrine's cause on the West Coast. ``He
made believers out of people that this could be done, the peregrine
could recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his infectious enthusiasm for the peregrine, Cade
managed to harness a huge cooperative venture, getting
universities, government agencies, industries, conservation groups
and the public to participate in its rescue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Cade began captive breeding of falcons in a huge
barn Cornell built for the purpose, there were no wild pairs of
breeding peregrines east of the Rockies and a pathetic few with
failing nests to the west. On Aug. 9, 1970, a New York Times
Magazine article, ``Death Comes to The Peregrine Falcon,'' lamented
a demise that many thought was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Cade, who said he had been fascinated by falcons from childhood
and who did his PhD dissertation on the peregrine and gyrafalcon in
Alaska, recalled that at first the peregrine's plight was
mistakenly attributed to overdevelopment, molestation by falconers,
collection of its brown speckled eggs by admirers and wanton
killing by people who simply did not like falcons.
</P>
<P>
   But at a conference at the University of Wisconsin in 1965,
experts realized that the crash of falcons was a worldwide problem,
and, as Rachel Carson suggested in ``The Silent Spring,'' DDT was
probably the main culprit.
</P>
<P>
   DDT is an organochloride compound that breaks down into DDE, a
highly persistent chemical that is stored in the fat of animals
that consume it, especially predators like peregrines that are at
the top of the food chain. DDE interferes with the deposition of
calcium in the shells of the birds' eggs, leaving them too fragile
to survive incubation by females weighing two or three pounds.
</P>
<P>
   When the rescue effort began, no one was sure falcons could be
bred on the large scale needed to restore them to their former
haunts. And, until DDT was banned in the United States in 1972,
there was little to be gained by reintroducing the bird into the
wild.
</P>
<P>
   As Stanley Temple, the wildlife ecologist at the University of
Wisconsin who helped direct the falcon reintroduction program while
a research associate at Cornell, recounted in 1980, ``First they
said, `You can't breed falcons in captivity.' We did it. Then it
was, `Well, if you can breed them in large numbers, you can't
reintroduce them into the wild'; `If you can reintroduce them into
the wild, they'll never survive'; `If they survive, they'll never
be able to form normal pair bonds'; `If they form pairs, they'll
never produce fertile eggs.' The peregrines have done all of those
things, and year by year the critics have fallen by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the breeding program at Cornell got off to a false start.
``We quickly learned that trying to unite wild adults was not the
way to do it,'' Cade said. ``They may have been too stressed by
captivity to mate.'' What did work was to take young birds from
Western and Northern peregrine nests and raise them together in
captivity in broods, to prevent them from imprinting on humans.
Then, when the birds reared in captivity reached sexual maturity,
at ages 2 to 4, they were paired in the Cornell breeding barn.
</P>
<P>
   The breeders also succeded with laboratory hatching of
thin-shelled eggs taken from the nests of wild birds. Cade and his
crew would remove the thin-shelled eggs and replace them with
artificial eggs made of plaster to maintain parental interest in
the breeding process. Then when the laboratory-incubated eggs
hatched, the chicks would be returned to their parents' nests.
</P>
<P>
   In the restoration project headed by Walton, coordinator of the
Predatory Bird Research Group at the University of California at
Santa Cruz, researchers sometimes removed thin-shelled eggs from a
nest and replaced them immediately with captive-bred young, which
the adult falcons readily accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Workers also added laboratory-hatched chicks to the nests of
falcons that managed to produce one or two of their own and removed
healthy eggs for laboratory hatching, prompting the adults to lay a
second clutch.
</P>
<P>
   But problems remained. Even now there are occasional egg shell
failures caused by DDT contamination from wintering grounds south
of the border and from still-hot dump sites here. Besides, DDT was
not the falcon's only enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, at least, the great horned owl has an insatiable
appetite for falcons, adults as well as nestlings, and the owl
population had increased where falcons once dwelled, like the
accessible cliffs in central New York state.
</P>
<P>
   This forced the rescuers to move above the owls' range in the
Adirondacks in northern New York and in the Green Mountains and
White Mountains of New England. They also turned to two unusual
environments for the falcon: coastal regions and cities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New York City is now home to far more breeding
falcons than any city in the world, and New York state has more
breeding pairs, 38 at last count, than any state east of the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting laboratory-hatched orphans back into the wild, a process
called hacking, was a daunting task. While still flightless, three
or four chicks were housed in a screen-protected box that was
erected on a high ledge, with a stove pipe extending from the top
of the cliff to the box so that humans could feed them unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Hack-box watchers, who did the job more for love than money,
were hired to monitor the birds 24 hours a day, seven days a week
and to drop food down the tube every day until the chicks were old
enough to fly and hunt for themselves. Unlike many other species,
falcons and other birds of prey do not need to be taught how to
hunt by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   After Cornell's early successes, in 1981 another captive
breeding project got under way, at the Raptor Center at the
University of Minnesota. Pat Redig, director of the Minnesota
center, recalled his frustrations in trying to repopulate the
cliffs along the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   With poles and other equipment supplied by Northern States
Power, hack boxes were erected on the adjacent sand dunes and the
birds moved on their own to the cliffs. But every one of six
nesting attempts made from 1984 to 1986 failed because of predation
by great horned owls.
</P>
<P>
   Even peregrines themselves proved troublesome. One aggressive
female dubbed ``Jaws'' would fly as far as four miles from her
aerie to harass young falcons as they tried to emerge from the
riverside boxes.
</P>
<P>
   So, with each new falcon introduction costing more than $2,000,
the Minnesota team decided to set up hack boxes on an office
building in downtown Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we moved to the city, we were successful beyond our
wildest dreams,'' Redig said. People and businesses contributed
money and time to the effort. And the birds thrived, with
Minneapolis pairs moving on their own as far as the Wacker Building
in Chicago and to a cliff on the north shore of Lake Superior.
Natural enough, since the name peregrine means wanderer.
</P>
<P>
   Urban peregrines have captivated their human neighbors, many of
whom admit they are addicted to watching their comings and goings.
A Minneapolis lawyer whose office faced a nest had to turn his desk
around so he could get his work done.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Carl R. Howard, who can see pairs that nest on the
Brooklyn Bridge from his downtown office, keeps a daily peregrine
diary during nesting season, recounting his observations in ``The
Urban Audubon,'' the newsletter of the New York City Audubon
Society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, restoring the original Eastern population of 250
nesting pairs of peregrines was considered an unlikely goal. But by
1998, there were at least 238 and counting, and throughout their
current range they are holding their own or increasing in number,
even though some are still being lost to thin egg shells, owls and
urban accidents with windows and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But in places like New York City, these emblems of avian
nobility have inspired great respect. For example, bridge repairs
and paint jobs are typically postponed until the fledglings have
left their rudimentary nesting sites, and not just because the
workers fear parental attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques developed for saving the peregrine are now being
applied to other species, including the Mauritius kestrel native to
an island in the Indian Ocean, the aplomado falcon that disappeared
from Texas in the early 1950s and the harpy eagle in Panama. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FALCON FACTS
</P>
<P>
   SIZE: The adult peregrine is a crow-sized bird, about 15 to 21
inches long with a wingspan of 36 to 44 inches, a hooked beak and
curved talons that can spear prey. Adult males weigh about one and
a half pounds, females more than two pounds.
</P>
<P>
   RANGE: Peregrines inhabit every continent except Antarctica, a
distribution rivaled only by the osprey and the raven.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED: A peregrine's cruising speed _ about 40 to 55 miles per
hour _ is matched by many birds, but its high-speed dives after
prey can exceed 200 miles an hour, which may make it the fastest
animal on earth.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTING: When it spots a potential meal, it partially folds back
its wings and plunges into its vertical power dive called a stoop.
Upon contact, it whacks its victim with its feet, a blow that is
often fatal. Prey that survive are killed by a toothlike projection
in the upper jaw that is used to dislocate the neck vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   MATING: A male peregrine normally requires about 10 square miles
of sky to perform its acrobatic courtship flight. Once birds are
three or four years old they begin producing viable eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The peregrine nests by making a shallow scrape in soil. On
cliffs, bridges and buildings, it commonly nests on fallen gravel.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESPAN: Half or more of hatchlings die in the first year of
life, but adult mortality is much lower _ about 10 percent to 15
percent a year. Their average life span is seven to eight years;
some have lived to 18.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTIONS: Although no longer on the federal list of
endangered species, the peregrine will continue to be protected by
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking, killing,
possession, transport or import of migratory birds, their eggs,
parts and nests without permission from the Department of the
Interior. The Peregrine Fund, at the World Center for Birds of Prey
near Boise, Idaho, has successfully bred, raised and released
peregrines.
</P>
<P>
   USES: There are 3,000 to 4,000 licensed falconers in the United
States who keep peregrines and hunt with them. Trained peregrines
have been used at airports to terrorize other birds that can
jeopardize aircraft.

<P>
   They had little or nothing in common and in the normal course of
events, it is unlikely their worlds would ever have intersected.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen A. Roskot, 19, the daughter of middle class parents on
Long Island, was a star athlete on the Columbia University lacrosse
team. Marie Jean-Paul, 39, known to her friends as Carol, grew up
in Haiti, and worked as a nurse's aide at a hospital in Brooklyn.
Joy Thomas, 18, graduated from Mount Vernon High School in June and
was studying to be a teacher at Westchester Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the course of 48 hours, the lives of these three women
were abruptly and horribly linked together: they were, all three,
the targets of homicidal attacks by men with whom they had shared
intimate moments.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, Roskot's throat was slashed in her dormitory room
with a kitchen knife, apparently wielded by a former Columbia
student she had dated. The next morning in Brooklyn, Jean-Paul's
husband used a machete to cut his wife's throat, then doused her
body and set it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, shot in the head in Westchester hours later, lived, but
only through a stroke of luck: her former boyfriend's pistol
jammed. In all three cases, the men believed responsible for the
attacks committed suicide shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics collected by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 32 percent of the 3,419 women murdered in the United
States in 1998, the latest year for which data are available, died
at the hands of a husband, a former husband, a boyfriend or a
former boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of smaller, regional studies and the limitations of
the data gathering methods used by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, however, many experts believe that the true figure
is much higher, perhaps as much as 50 to 70 percent. In comparison,
4 percent of 10,606 male homicide victims in 1998 were killed by
current or former intimate partners.
</P>
<P>
   While homicide rates as a whole have sharply declined over the
past 20 years, and the rate at which men are murdered by intimate
partners along with them, rates for women, and particularly for
white women, have not declined as sharply, despite efforts by
police departments around the country to increase their response to
calls involving domestic violence. In some regions, New York City
for example, they have not gone down at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come close to affecting intimate partner violence
and homicide the way we have other kinds of violence and assault,''
said Dr. Susan Wilt, director of the New York City Department of
Health's Office of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. ``It
remains a shocking issue that this is the main reason that women
end up dead and that it occurs within the context of their home and
family, where they are supposed to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women worry when they go out,'' Wilt said. ``They should worry
when they stay in.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are men so much more likely to murder their partners than
women? Feminist scholars and domestic violence experts have long
contended that such crimes reflect a society where men feel
entitled to exercise power and control over women, and to use
physical violence when necessary to assert their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a culture that in many ways celebrates male
dominance and female submission, and that is in some ways the
definition of an erotic heterosexual relationship,'' said Sally
Goldfarb, an associate professor at Rutgers School of Law in
Camden, N.J., and an expert in family law.
</P>
<P>
   Some evolutionary psychologists who study spousal murders, like
Dr. Margo Wilson and Dr. Martin Daly at McMaster University in
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, also argue that men as a whole, rather
than individual men, are the problem. But they base this assertion
not on culture but on biology. Violence, they believe, may have
developed as a strategy for men to exert proprietary control over
women, and in particular over their reproductive capacities. Many
psychologists, in contrast, focus on the personality
characteristics and life histories that lead men to batter and
kill.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the validity of such views, social scientists have in
recent years begun to investigate homicides by intimate partners in
a much more systematic way, hoping to find ways to spot the
potential for lethal violence before it occurs, and to develop
better tactics for intervention.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from such studies is a picture as consistent as it
is discomforting. Many studies confirm, for example, that women are
at particular risk when they are in the process of leaving a
relationship, something long noted by domestic violence workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 293 women murdered by intimates in North Carolina
from 1991 to 1993, Dr. Beth Moracco of the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health and her colleagues found that 42
percent had been killed after they threatened separation, tried to
separate or had recently separated from their partners. In another
study, researchers found that of 551 intimate partner homicides in
Ontario from 1974 to 1990, 32 percent were committed in the context
of a separation; in another 11 percent, the killer believed that
the female partner was sexually unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   The period after a woman has left is often the most risky,
studies find. In a review of homicides in Chicago, for example,
Wilson and Daly found that 50 percent of the murders of wives by
their husbands took place within two months after a separation; 85
percent occurred within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The link between separation and murder is more than
incidental,'' Wilson and Daly observed in their study. ``Homicidal
husbands are often noted to have threatened to do exactly what they
did, should their wives ever leave them, and they often explain
their homicides as responses to the intolerable stimulus of the
wife's departure.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of emotion that leads men to kill women they once
loved is often evident in the crimes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a crime of rage,'' said Wilt, who has been
tracking homicides by intimate partners in New York City since
1990. ``There is a sense of `How dare you think you can live
without me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 379 women known to have been murdered by male intimates
in New York from 1990 to 1997, Wilt and her colleagues found, 46.7
percent were killed with guns, 26.6 percent were stabbed, 8.2
percent were bludgeoned, 7.9 percent were strangled, and 10.6
percent were killed by other means, including suffocation and being
pushed from a window or the top of a building.
</P>
<P>
   That women killed by a male partner are more likely to be
stabbed or strangled than those killed by someone less close to
them, Wilt said, reflects the emotional nature of the crime. ``When
you stab or strangle someone to death, it's a lot more intimate
than shooting them,'' Wilt said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Dutton, a psychologist at the University of British
Columbia who recently completed a study of 50 men in prison for the
murders of their wives, said that ``typically, the murder itself is
over-kill _ there is more done to the woman than is necessary to
kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said men who killed their wives or girlfriends tended to
fall into two categories. A minority, he said, are calculating
killers, whose motive is instrumental _ cashing in on an insurance
policy, for example. More common, he said, are killers who suffer
from severe personality disturbances. Such men, Dutton said, often
have a terror of being abandoned and express their dependency in
extreme jealousy and controlling behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on deep down is that they believe the woman is
leaving them and they can't live without her,'' he said. ``The
prospect of her leaving throws them into a downward spiral where
they feel like they are staring into the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, Dutton added, the murderer enters a ``dissociated,''
trancelike state after the killing. In one case, he said, a man
killed his wife and children in Berkeley, Calif., boarded a plane
for New York, and was picked up by the police at La Guardia Airport
still wearing his bloody clothes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when a woman is murdered, it appears to come out of
nowhere: Thomas G. Nelford, the Columbia dropout who is believed to
have killed Roskot, appears to have had no history of battering.
</P>
<P>
   More often, though, there were many portents of danger. Through
a study of completed and attempted murders of women by intimate
partners in 11 large and mid-size cities, a group of researchers,
led by Dr. Jacquelyn Campbell at Johns Hopkins University School of
Nursing, is trying to put together a list of risk factors for
lethal violence.
</P>
<P>
   The study is not yet completed, but Campbell and her colleagues
have published a small part of their findings and have posted some
preliminary findings on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The study reinforces the findings of other research. For
example, Campbell said in an interview, the researchers are finding
that the biggest risk factor is a history of violent behavior by
the man in the relationship. Of 250 women in the study who were
killed by current or former partners, 65 percent had been assaulted
by their partner in the past. Of the 200 victims of attempted
homicide, 72 percent had experienced a previous assault.
</P>
<P>
   Past stalking of the woman by her male partner, Campbell and her
colleagues found, also posed a significant risk, occurring in 69
percent of homicides and 84 percent of attempted homicides. When
the woman had separated from her partner, the frequency of stalking
rose to 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Campbell said, stalking occurred even when the
couple lived together. A man, for example, might show up
unexpectedly at his partner's workplace, beep her repeatedly on a
pager, demanding to know where she was, or telephone her dozens of
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Other predictors of lethal violence included an escalation in
the frequency or severity of physical abuse, attempts by the man to
choke the woman or to force her to have sex, the presence of a gun
in the house, the use of street drugs or the abuse of alcohol by
the man, verbal threats, and the woman's belief that her partner
was capable of killing her.
</P>
<P>
   A history of domestic violence is found less often in men who
kill themselves after killing their partners, Campbell said.
Studies indicate that about 25 percent of men who kill their
partners commit suicide afterward. Often, they do so with an equal
display of emotion: Jean-Paul's husband, for example, is believed
to have set himself on fire. The man police believe killed Roskot
threw himself in front of a subway train a few hours after her
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in the multicity study, men who tortured or killed
animals _ long thought to be a sign of potential danger _ were no
more likely to kill their partners. But Campbell cautioned: ``No
matter what the research says, what I say to women is, `If he does
something that is terribly frightening, be scared! If it makes the
hair stand up on the back of your neck, be scared!'''
</P>
<P>
   In one case she encountered, Campbell said, a man slit the
throat of his wife's favorite dog and left the dead pet in the
bathtub for her to find.
</P>
<P>
   What can women do to protect themselves? At least one study, by
the National Center for State Courts, of civil protection orders
issued in three jurisdictions, found that contrary to popular
belief, such orders are effective in the majority of cases, making
women feel safer and reducing incidents of violence. A court order
obtained by Thomas, the Westchester Community College student,
however, appears to have done her little good.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in most cases, by the time a court intervenes, the
woman's situation is already dire. For young women, said Goldfarb,
of Rutgers, an important preventive measure is to be alert for
signs that a man is potentially dangerous _ before the relationship
grows serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the same types of gestures or comments that we are
taught as young girls to view as romantic are, in fact, major
warning signs of a serious potential for domestic violence,''
Goldfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave as examples statements that might appear solicitous but
that in reality may indicate extreme jealousy or a controlling
nature. A man might say, for example, ``I can't live without you,''
or ``You only need me,'' or ``I can't breathe unless I'm near
you.'' Or he might phone her 20 times a day or appear unexpectedly
at her door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound like Prince Charming,'' Goldfarb said. ``But in
reality that kind of possessiveness is designed to isolate a woman
from other sources of support in her life. It is a foreshadowing of
violence.''

   ``I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change.'' The title of this
long-running off-Broadway show sums up the source of most marital
problems. All too often, the very characteristics that initially
attracted partners to one another or the disturbing behaviors that
at first were ignored or considered unimportant eventually become
marital sore points and the cause of repeated arguments and chronic
unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   Couples struggle to get one another to change _ to conform to
each other's needs and desires and definition of a more perfect
partner. ``Why don't you ...?'' ``Why can't you ...?'' ``Why aren't
you ...?'' and ``You're wrong ...'' are common pleas and criticisms
that are more likely to precipitate arguments than change. Anger,
accusations and attempts at coercion do not inspire compassion and
cooperation, and rarely do couples who use this approach succeed on
their own in exacting the desired changes.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who seek marital therapy before deciding to divorce
have considerably less than a 50-50 chance of achieving and
maintaining the changes that would make for a more peaceful union.
The primary focus of traditional therapy is to encourage both
partners to change their behavior so that they can enjoy each other
more and hurt each other less. Too often these deliberate changes
fail to result from a full appreciation for the other partner's
pain or perspective, and sooner or later the old irritating
behaviors re-emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``acceptance therapy,'' or, as it is technically called,
``integrative couples therapy.'' This novel concept, which grew out
of a therapist's disillusionment with traditional techniques, is
exhaustively described and illustrated in a new book,
``Reconcilable Differences'' (Guilford Publications, $23.95) by Dr.
Andrew Christensen and the late Dr. Neil S. Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   The two psychologists offer a slew of tools that couples can use
to reconcile their differences without the help of a therapist.
There are now some 50,000 marital therapists in the nation, but
with half of marriages doomed to fail, they are still in short
supply. Besides, the cost of therapy often makes professional aid
unattainable by those who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for any therapy to succeed in reviving a
relationship, there must be a desire on the part of both partners
to make a go of it. The approach of integrative therapy is that
rather than force change, partners should start by accepting each
other's differences and appreciating their individual
sensitivities. Instead of backing partners into a corner by
insisting on changes, this kind of understanding often leads to
uncoerced changes that are more lasting and more in tune with each
partner's core personality and behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   One virtue of the book is its utter realism, its repeated
warnings that one or another tactic may backfire, which are then
followed by new strategies. Christensen, a professor of psychology
at the University of California at Los Angeles, emphasizes that
their goal ``was not to oversimplify the process or give cookbook
recipes to solve every problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Institute of Mental Health has been
sufficiently impressed with the early results of integrative
couples therapy _ a pilot study had a success rate of 80 percent _
to award $3 million for a clinical trial involving about 150
couples. Half the couples will receive traditional therapy and the
other half the integrative approach. The outcome of the six to nine
months of treatment will be measured in terms of couple
satisfaction and stability of the union and the couples will be
followed for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea behind acceptance therapy is that acceptance of
another person's traits and behaviors often leads to compassion,
and when partners learn to use compassion in dealing with one
another, they tend to become more willing to let go of conflict and
even change the troubling behavior. The psychologists suggest that
partners in conflict work on accepting, even embracing, each
other's irritating behaviors and characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accept means to tolerate what you regard as an unpleasant
behavior, to understand its deeper meaning (and) see it in a larger
context,'' Christensen and Jacobson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance is most likely to emerge through understanding, so
the first step they recommend is to analyze the anatomy of an
argument by developing a story about an important relationship
problem that incorporates the perspectives of both partners,
identifies incompatibilities and vulnerabilities and describes how
each person copes and how the problem escalates into conflict. Then
go back over the story to see whether it focuses on differences
rather than defects, vulnerabilities rather than violations,
descriptions rather than judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your focus shifts from the offending actions of each of
you to the soft spots that are bruised by these actions, you may
come to a new understanding of each other, one that cuts angry
arguments short and over time brings you closer together,'' the
psychologists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, important thoughts and feelings about a conflict are
left unsaid, either because of a lack of awareness or a fear of
becoming vulnerable by disclosing them. ``Yet,'' the authors wrote,
``it is precisely these revelations that could alter the tone of
the discussion and perhaps elicit empathy between you.''
</P>
<P>
   When partners feel pressured to change, they tend to become
defensive and withdraw, the psychologists point out. But when
partners feel accepted and understood, they are more likely to
change willingly, often making more changes than requested. Even if
no change occurs, acceptance and compassion are likely to bring a
couple closer.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of acceptance may be the realization that what now
drives a person crazy about a partner is a characteristic that was
a source of the initial attraction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a woman who is timid and conservative may be drawn
to a man who is sociable and spontaneous. But with time and the
arrival of children, the husband's tendency to pursue social
activities that exclude his wife or to take risks the wife
considers dangerous and inconsiderate for a man with a family can
become a serious source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Another important feature of acceptance is to realize that
partners are not being deliberately mean. For example, when a
husband failed to tell his wife until the last moment that he was
going hiking for the weekend with his best friend, she became
furious over his inconsiderate behavior. But his intent was not to
hurt his wife. It was his way of avoiding an argument. To end a
vicious cycle of avoidance and hurt, the husband needed to
understand and accept his wife's sensitivity to feeling left out
and her difficulties in making plans of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, though, that acceptance has its limits. The
psychologists state emphatically that some behaviors _ like
physical and psychological abuse _ should never be accepted.

   The more biologists understand of living cells, the more
daunting seems the task of figuring out everything they do. The
average human cell is too small to be seen, yet at any moment up to
30,000 of its 100,000 genes may be flicking on or off, executing
the cell's housekeeping needs or responding to messages from other
cells.
</P>
<P>
   How can a machine so tiny and so intricate ever be analyzed? And
even if by prodigious effort one human cell were ever completely
understood, there are at least 200 different types in the human
body.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of a series of ever more ingenious methods _
techniques to splice genes, produce them in bulk and measure the
activity of individual genes _ has taught biologists not to
despair. Now a new technique may be about to join this array of
powerful tools, although it remains to be seen if its effectiveness
will match its conceptual elegance.
</P>
<P>
   The method, described in the Feb. 15 issue of Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, involves attaching very large sets of
DNA molecules, such as all of a cell's active genes, to invisibly
small plastic beads five microns (millionths of a meter) in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Once anchored to the beads, the genes can be compared, sorted
and even sequenced en masse, meaning the order of the DNA units on
each bead can be determined. Since thousands of genes are handled
at a time, the bead system can generate vast amounts of
information.
</P>
<P>
   The bead system operates on a test-tube scale, avoiding the
expensive machines and labor of conventional technology. And much
of the processing is done by interactions of the DNA itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Let the DNA work for us instead of us working for
the DNA,''' said Dr. Sydney Brenner, the inventor of the technique.
Brenner, a biologist, has been a major figure in efforts to
decipher the workings of the genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner's ideas have been put into practice by scientists at
Lynx Therapeutics, of Hayward, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. George Church, a DNA sequencing expert at
Harvard University, the new technology should in principle be far
cheaper than the conventional methods being used to decode the
entire human genetic inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Church said he did not know in practice how far advanced the new
method might be. ``The question is whether they have something
really amazing or whether they hit a little more trouble than they
thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Mazur, director of genomics and bioinformatics at
DuPont's agricultural division, which is using the new technology,
said work was going well and ``is giving us a global view of gene
expression in plants.'' As with most novel methods, there had been
``glitches,'' but the technique's inherent advantage was its
sensitivity to gene transcripts produced in small quantity, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Lynx's technology is to attach large sets of DNA
molecules _ which can be all of a cell's active genes, or all the
fragments of a genome _ to minuscule beads. The process exploits
the fact that DNA likes to exist in the form of a double-stranded
molecule, with the sequence of chemical letters in one strand
exactly matching a counterpart sequence in the other. Strands of
complementary sequence will bind tightly to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx's method for attaching the genes to beads is ingenious and
complicated, but in essence involves building up 32-letter
sequences of DNA on a set of beads. These sequences are known as
anti-tags. The counterpart tags are attached to the genes under
study.
</P>
<P>
   One use of the beads is to compare large sets of genes that
differ in only a few genes of interest, for example, those that are
active in the normal and cancerous versions of a cell.
</P>
<P>
   First, a library of beads is made containing all the active
genes from both types of cell. The bead-linked genes are then
rendered single-stranded so that each is ready to bind with its
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Single-stranded copies of genes are then obtained again from
both types of cell, but this time a red chemical dye is attached to
all the cancer cells' genes and a blue dye to those of the normal
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the beads, when exposed to the colored genes, will
attract both red and blue versions. But a few beads will capture
only red genes, which are those expressed just in the cancer cells,
and a few will bind only blue genes, which are those the cancer
cells have suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Though existing gene chips can also be used to track the
expression of genes, they require knowing in advance the DNA
sequence of the genes to be monitored. Brenner's method does not
depend on knowing any gene's structure, but captures almost all of
a cell's 30,000 or so active genes.
</P>
<P>
   The same method can be applied to searching for defective genes
that contribute to disease. The conventional approach, based on
searching for SNP's (pronounced ``snips''), or single nucleotide
polymorphisms, requires identifying some 100,000 SNP's across the
human genome, an extremely costly task. The bead method focuses
directly on the genes that differ between the normal and a diseased
population.
</P>
<P>
   When genes of interest have been isolated by the bead system,
the next step is to identify them. Brenner has invented a method
for sequencing all the genes on a set of beads in parallel, meaning
that all the beads are sequenced at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The method depends on adaptors that bind to a specific sequence
of the four DNA letters on the tail of each bead's gene. The
adaptors, of which there are 256 different kinds, are identified by
fluorescent probes, whose presence on the immobilized beads is
recorded by a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Four such cycles are required to identify the first 16 letters
in the tail of each gene. This is enough to identify every gene
whose DNA sequence is known and all genes once the human genome is
completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Israel is losing its military struggle against
Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon _ but winning its
propaganda war on the conflict in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Although Israeli planes bombed three Lebanese power stations
last week after guerrillas killed six occupation soldiers, western
press and television reports almost unanimously portrayed the
latest violence in Lebanon as a war by Israel in defense of its
civilians on the other side of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no Israeli civilians were targeted, let alone hurt, and
all the Israeli soldiers who died were inside their occupation zone
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists based in the Middle East say that Israeli diplomats
have mounted a letter-writing campaign to their editors _
especially in the United States _ in an attempt to explain away the
latest war as a response to ``terrorism'' while failing to mention
that the Israeli casualties occurred in Lebanon, not in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the BBC, Moshe Fogel, Israel's official spokesman, tried to
justify the Israeli raids on Lebanon's power stations _ a clear
breach of the April 1996 cease-fire agreement _ on the grounds that
``Hezbollah terrorists are attacking our soldiers and civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   But no Israeli civilians had been attacked in the violence
leading to the air raids and Fogel failed to mention that the
soldiers to whom he referred had been killed in their military
positions inside southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The only civilians to be wounded were Lebanese, 17 of whom were
hurt in the Israeli bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent BBC World Service news reports frequently
referred to ``the killing of six Israeli soldiers'' without
mentioning that they had died in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   An American academic who writes regularly on the Middle East
telephoned the Independent's Beirut office last week to ask if
electricity stations had actually been targeted by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize we are just not hearing about this?'' she
asked. ``All we're getting on television here in the States is
Israel's line about `terrorism' and how their civilians are being
forced to live in shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Israelis living on their northern border were ordered
into bunkers by their own government. On this occasion, the
Hezbollah did not fire a single rocket over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the coverage was a report in The Washington Post
whose Jerusalem correspondent referred in an article to what he
called ``Israel's two-decade-old intervention in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an ``intervention' _ ironically, this was the
very word the Soviet Union used when it invaded Afghanistan in 1980
_ Israel has twice invaded Lebanon and has occupied part of it in
violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   In The Independent's ``Right of Reply'' column last Friday, the
Israeli ambassador to Britain, Dror Zeigerman, also attempted to
justify the Israeli raids on the grounds of ``terrorist activities
against Israel across the border'' and failed to mention that the
six Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Hezbollah attacks were launched from ``civilian
villages'' and were ``a flagrant violation of previous
understandings.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the Israeli dead were killed by roadside
bombs primed and exploded inside Israel's own occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Timur Goksel, the special adviser to the United
Nations force commander in southern Lebanon, stated publicly that
the Hezbollah ``has not really violated the April (1996) accords.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N., the Hezbollah has carried out 300 attacks
on Israeli occupation troops in December, 250 in January and at
least 60 so far this month.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Hezbollah has fired Katyusha rockets across the
Lebanese-Israeli border _ but almost always in retaliation for the
Israeli wounding of Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 cease-fire accord states that the guerrillas and
Israeli troops may assault each other's forces inside Lebanon but
must not attack civilian targets or use civilians as cover.
</P>
<P>
   In all the reporting of last week's violence in southern
Lebanon, no mention was made of the 1,000-strong force Israel keeps
in the occupied zone or of the notorious Khiam jail there in which
_ as Amnesty International and other human-rights groups have
protested _ men and women prisoners are routinely tortured with
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked to
comment on the war, she contented herself with a reference to the
Hezbollah as ``enemies of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in Israel, it seems, are there journalists brave enough to
tell the truth about southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most eloquent is the novelist David Grossman who wrote
in Yedioth Aharonoth that Israel should ``evacuate the outposts,
bring the soldiers home'' and redeploy across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go. Learn to live with the insult, swallow the empty pride,
stop feeding the fire of our lingering, pitiful arrogance with more
and more of our young soldiers. We have lost. It's OK to say it
aloud, no ne dies from saying it....''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have found an American reporter daring to say that
last week. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ Israel is losing its military struggle against
Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon _ but winning its
propaganda war on the conflict in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Although Israeli planes bombed three Lebanese power stations
last week after guerrillas killed six occupation soldiers, western
press and television reports almost unanimously portrayed the
latest violence in Lebanon as a war by Israel in defense of its
civilians on the other side of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no Israeli civilians were targeted, let alone hurt, and
all the Israeli soldiers who died were inside their occupation zone
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists based in the Middle East say that Israeli diplomats
have mounted a letter-writing campaign to their editors _
especially in the United States _ in an attempt to explain away the
latest war as a response to ``terrorism'' while failing to mention
that the Israeli casualties occurred in Lebanon, not in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the BBC, Moshe Fogel, Israel's official spokesman, tried to
justify the Israeli raids on Lebanon's power stations _ a clear
breach of the April 1996 cease-fire agreement _ on the grounds that
``Hezbollah terrorists are attacking our soldiers and civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   But no Israeli civilians had been attacked in the violence
leading to the air raids and Fogel failed to mention that the
soldiers to whom he referred had been killed in their military
positions inside southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The only civilians to be wounded were Lebanese, 17 of whom were
hurt in the Israeli bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent BBC World Service news reports frequently
referred to ``the killing of six Israeli soldiers'' without
mentioning that they had died in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   An American academic who writes regularly on the Middle East
telephoned the Independent's Beirut office last week to ask if
electricity stations had actually been targeted by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize we are just not hearing about this?'' she
asked. ``All we're getting on television here in the States is
Israel's line about `terrorism' and how their civilians are being
forced to live in shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Israelis living on their northern border were ordered
into bunkers by their own government. On this occasion, the
Hezbollah did not fire a single rocket over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the coverage was a report in The Washington Post
whose Jerusalem correspondent referred in an article to what he
called ``Israel's two-decade-old intervention in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an ``intervention' _ ironically, this was the
very word the Soviet Union used when it invaded Afghanistan in 1980
_ Israel has twice invaded Lebanon and has occupied part of it in
violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   In The Independent's ``Right of Reply'' column last Friday, the
Israeli ambassador to Britain, Dror Zeigerman, also attempted to
justify the Israeli raids on the grounds of ``terrorist activities
against Israel across the border'' and failed to mention that the
six Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Hezbollah attacks were launched from ``civilian
villages'' and were ``a flagrant violation of previous
understandings.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the Israeli dead were killed by roadside
bombs primed and exploded inside Israel's own occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Timur Goksel, the special adviser to the United
Nations force commander in southern Lebanon, stated publicly that
the Hezbollah ``has not really violated the April (1996) accords.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N., the Hezbollah has carried out 300 attacks
on Israeli occupation troops in December, 250 in January and at
least 60 so far this month.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Hezbollah has fired Katyusha rockets across the
Lebanese-Israeli border _ but almost always in retaliation for the
Israeli wounding of Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 cease-fire accord states that the guerrillas and
Israeli troops may assault each other's forces inside Lebanon but
must not attack civilian targets or use civilians as cover.
</P>
<P>
   In all the reporting of last week's violence in southern
Lebanon, no mention was made of the 1,000-strong force Israel keeps
in the occupied zone or of the notorious Khiam jail there in which
_ as Amnesty International and other human-rights groups have
protested _ men and women prisoners are routinely tortured with
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked to
comment on the war, she contented herself with a reference to the
Hezbollah as ``enemies of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in Israel, it seems, are there journalists brave enough to
tell the truth about southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most eloquent is the novelist David Grossman who wrote
in Yedioth Aharonoth that Israel should ``evacuate the outposts,
bring the soldiers home'' and redeploy across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go. Learn to live with the insult, swallow the empty pride,
stop feeding the fire of our lingering, pitiful arrogance with more
and more of our young soldiers. We have lost. It's OK to say it
aloud, no ne dies from saying it....''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have found an American reporter daring to say that
last week. &QL;

 &HT;    BUSH CAMPAIGN USES CORPORATE JETS MORE THAN McCAIN, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    460&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as George W. Bush has attacked Sen. John
McCain's record as a reformer, the Texas governor's campaign has
flown aboard corporate jets twice as often as his rival, says a
study by the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The non-partisan group, using Federal Election Commission
records, said the Bush presidential campaign accepted 78 flights on
executive jets last year. Many of the 35 companies that provided
the planes have business dealings with the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, McCain last year took 35 flights on jets provided
by 13 companies. Many of the firms have dealings before his Senate
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took up the jet issue as part of his attempt to snatch the
reformer's mantle from the Arizona senator in the Republican
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that I worry about is what we call
Washington double-talk, to say one thing and actually do another,''
Bush told a Chamber of Commerce gathering in suburban Detroit last
week as he mentioned his opponent's use of jets owned by companies.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Center for Responsive Politics, which advocates
campaign finance reform, concluded that ``Bush benefits from the
same special interest favors that he has chastised McCain for
taking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp stresses the fact that its candidate flies only on
chartered aircraft paid for by his campaign. However, his campaign
regularly borrows aircraft to fly the governor's ``surrogates,''
including his wife, Laura; his father, former President George
Bush; his mother, Barbara Bush; former Republican candidate
Elizabeth Dole, and Gov. John Engler of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the private jets has been a sore point for critics of
special interest money in politics. By law, the campaigns are
required to reimburse the companies the equivalent of first-class
tickets, but that is only a fraction of the cost of using the
private planes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bush campaign reimbursed companies more than
$152,000 for the flights, and McCain reimbursed corporations just
over $77,400.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said Monday that Bush
will continue make McCain's use of jets an issue. ``When people
advocate reform, it's important to live up to the reform they
advocate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said that he traveled by corporate jets because his
cash-poor campaign could not afford chartered aircraft. Last week
he announced that thanks to the funds raised since his victory in
New Hampshire on Feb. 1, he is now traveling on a campaign charter.
</P>
<P>
   The group's study of 1999 records, the latest available, did not
examine flights taken by Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that provided aircraft for McCain last year
was BellSouth Corp., which provided four flights.
Telecommunications is a major concern of McCain's Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Westfield Corp., a shopping center developer,
also provided four flights. The Center for Responsive Politics
noted that despite Westfield's assistance, McCain has sought a
permanent ban on sales taxes for Internet purchases, a position the
company opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Another jet provider, Paxon Communications, provided four
flights that became a campaign controversy last month when it was
disclosed that McCain urged the Federal Communications Commission
to make a long-delayed decision on Paxon's purchase of a Pittsburgh
TV station.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the campaign filings showed that Enron Corp., a
Houston-based energy company, provided eight flights. Enron has
numerous dealings with the state on the issues of electric utility
deregulation and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that provided planes for Bush's campaign include
the Dallas-based Occidental Chemical Corp. and Pilgrim's Pride, a
chicken processing company, each of which provided a jet five
times. Union Pacific, a railroad company, provided a jet four
times.

TWO WOMEN CLOSE THE GENERATION GAP

week at a local retirement home. Tom Mendoza/Daily News 
 
 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you feel younger? Hang out with older people.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Komaiko, a Van Nuys writer of children's books who'd just
hit 44, hoped that might work. A baby boomer who grew up with the
Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones, said she was feeling old,
ancient, as if life was passing her by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Is this all there is?''' Leah said. ``What a
letdown. Do we just sit and wait to get old?''
</P>
<P>
   Then she volunteered to visit an older woman in a local nursing
home, a woman who was blind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years later, Leah feels young again and knows it's
her friendship with Adele, 96, that's keeping her that way.
</P>
<P>
   And she's shared those feelings _ as well as tidbits of wisdom
on aging and more from her elderly friend _ in a book about the
unlikely pairing of the two women of different generations. ``Am I
Old Yet?'' (St. Martin's Press; $20) might help other baby boomers
ease their own fears about aging, Leah says _ and Adele (who asks
that her last name not be used, either in the book or this article)
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made me stop being so self-centered about my fear of
aging,'' said Leah, who visits Adele at a Van Nuys retirement home
several times a week, takes her to lunch and on trips to the
hairdresser and the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adele's taught me not to be so stupid as not to live your life
fully every day. She taught me to take care of myself because you
don't know who or what is going to take care of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Adele, who worked as a secretary (she was one of the first to
use Thomas Edison's Dictaphone) despite her lack of vision, married
in her 20s and gave birth to two daughters and a son. She's been a
widow nearly 40 years, and one of her daughters has died. She's
lived in the retirement home, in a room that's as impersonal as a
motel room, for nine years, and wishes her family would visit more
often.
</P>
<P>
   While she'd rather live on her own, she's realistic _ and
philosophical _ about her life. There are still things to enjoy,
like singing, listening to books on tape, dancing, visits with
Leah.
</P>
<P>
   The friendship began somewhat shakily, arranged by a local
volunteer agency. Neither had ever had a friend so far from their
own age. Both were a little afraid they'd have nothing in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, if I come across somebody young, I'd figure they
wouldn't want to bother with me. I'm too old for them,'' Adele
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was apprehensive, but hopeful,'' Leah recalled. ``I didn't
know what I was getting myself into. It scared me that I liked
her.''
</P>
<P>
   But just like women the same age, they discovered they liked
eggplant parmesan, good haircuts, new purses and taking walks.
</P>
<P>
   And books. Leah writes them and Adele, with the help of a tape
player, listens to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like true stories, not made-up ones,'' Adele said. ``And I
like that there's a book about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah got the idea for the ``book about us'' as she realized her
friendship with Adele had become more than a once-a-week courtesy
visit to an lonely old lady. The two women had begun to share their
lives as Leah visited more often, and Adele told Leah about her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd visit Adele, and I realized that I felt so young when I
left,'' Leah marveled. ``I was intrigued because I was waking up a
certain part of myself that had been dead. I was so jaded. Now I'm
hanging around someone who's old but not jaded. I'd found the
antidote.''
</P>
<P>
   Adele loves Leah's visits and hopes the book will encourage
other people to visit the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Both women have grown along with their friendship. And Leah
found the answers to her fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I knew,'' Leah wrote in her book. ``No matter how old
a person is, if she has love in her life, there is only one age _
alive.'' &QL;

ON THE WEB, MAGAZINE IS ALL THE BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of editor of Mothers Who Think site to Jennifer
Foote Sweeney; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buzz snakes through our culture like millennial mist. People and
institutions rise and fall on their ability to generate the stuff.
For more than a decade, Tina Brown was the fin de siecle queen of
buzz. As editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she and her
publications dominated table talk at All The Right Places.
</P>
<P>
   But today Brown is in eclipse. The latest pretender to her
throne is David Talbot, creator of Salon.com, the randy, San
Francisco-based online magazine. Talbot's house of buzz has cooked
up a daily gumbo of news and opinion, arguably hotter than anything
on the Internet. Anchored by outstanding cultural coverage, it
presents a sexed, edgy confection that attracts readers like moths
to a back porch light.
</P>
<P>
   And it has done so in cyberspace, not on the newsstand. ``Salon
is the first really successful new media site on the Net,'' says
media critic Jon Katz. ``It is the first to figure out how to fuse
content and interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Its craving for attention is matched by its penchant for
controversy. Salon is in the news for its lapses in judgment as
well as its scoops. Its writing, says Washington Post media critic
Howard Kurtz, ranges from superb to sophomoric. The editorial
product can be as uneven as it is insouciant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this unhinged approach has legs is unclear. ``Salon's
strength and weakness is that it takes all kinds of editorial
chances in an age when most publications are cautious and overly
polite,'' Kurtz says.
</P>
<P>
   When Salon is good, it is very good. Salon reporter Daniel
Forbes made headlines last month when he uncorked a story
documenting the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy's searching of network television scripts for antidrug
messages. It was a superior piece of journalism and a clean score
for Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Talbot ran a piece by Dan Savage, an
openly gay Seattle-based writer bent on giving then-presidential
candidate Gary Bauer the flu because of Bauer's antipathy toward
gays. Savage, who had come down with the virus, posed as a Bauer
volunteer in Iowa and fraudulently voted as a Republican there.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers howled about the piece, which they considered
beyond the pale even for Salon. Talbot printed a sampling of their
e-mail tirades along with an editor's note in which he stood by the
article without condoning what Savage claimed to have done. Today,
Talbot remains unchastened by l'affaire Savage: ``My only
difficulty was not to have put an editor's note on the piece when
it ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon, then, is the gifted adolescent who dazzles a crowd yet
forgets to clean up his room. And it couldn't care less about
criticism. ``There is no bad buzz,'' says David Weir, its
Washington bureau chief, updating P.T. Barnum's famous dictum.
``We're not The New York Times. We're not gatekeepers of what
should be published.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Salon's sense of propriety is elastic, its
pursuit of cheek singleminded. ``The primary reason Salon exists is
because of the frustration I felt by the confines of daily
journalism,'' explains Talbot, a former arts editor of the San
Francisco Examiner. ``It has become increasingly formulaic and
focus-group driven _ simply dull. I came of age with the gonzo
journalism of Hunter Thompson in Rolling Stone. It was risk-taking,
provocative journalism. We've done that here.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about that. Salon is still recovering from the
firestorm it created in 1998 over the story it ran, on the eve of
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, about a
34-year-old extramarital affair of House Judiciary Committee
chairman Henry Hyde. All 57 journalistic organizations that were
offered the story turned it down. Salon's Washington correspondent,
Jonathan Broder, left over Talbot's decision to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot was pilloried for leaky ethics and a pro-Clinton agenda.
There were bomb threats at the office and death threats at home. He
wrote at the time that ``ugly times call for ugly tactics'' and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is also a feast of guilty pleasures. It produces stories
as illicit in this earnest world as Godiva chocolates to a weight
watcher. High in this category are the 53 episodes of ``Nancy Chan:
Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl.'' This fictional romp catches with
a gimlet eye the lust in the Imperial City with chapters like
``Thighs Wide Shut.'' Salon also has a regular sex column. One
recent offering by Susie Bright titled ``The Randy Bellboy''
provided tips on how lonely female hotel guests can get serviced by
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbot also craves serious credentials. Salon's political
reportage, notably its award-winning work on the Whitewater
scandal, has been solid. Last summer, Weir opened a Washington
bureau that will soon have nine reporters. (There are 56 on the
editorial staff, 10 in New York and the rest in San Francisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Jake Tapper, its lead political reporter, provides a steady
stream of smart, wry coverage of the presidential campaign. The day
after the New Hampshire primary, while the rest of the media herd
focused on South Carolina, Anthony York had a strong piece
detailing how the arcane rules in the California primaries will
hinder the transfer of raw votes among independents for John McCain
and Bill Bradley into convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, sex trumps politics at Salon.
Grown-up discussion of it is Salon's long suit and is marbled
through the 11 Salon sites, which include Arts &AMP; Entertainment,
Books, Health &AMP; Body, Media, News, Politics2000, and, Technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest is Mothers Who Think, edited by Jennifer
Foote Sweeney, devoted to intelligent exploration of real life for
women with children. Two weeks ago, it ran a piece asking, ``Is
this child pornography?'' about the trend among photo labs to call
police over film of naked children in bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot celebrates sex because no one else does. He considers it
an effective tool to distance Salon from online competitors. ``The
question for new media operations is: What do you do that no one
else does?'' he asks. ``Most publications in America can't answer
that effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But more fundamentally, Talbot chafes at the way sex is treated
in this country. ``The US is childish as a culture in dealing with
it,'' says Talbot, who wrote a book on the subject. ``It is treated
either in a snickering sophomoric way or a harrumphing prudish way.
I find that inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Weir, ``I can't think of a dinner party when sex doesn't
come up along with politics, books, and movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot started Salon in 1995 as a weekly cultural digest. Books
were its windows to the world. ``At the beginning, we concluded
that the focus on new ideas in arts and culture and politics tended
to emerge through books,'' Weir says. Salon's book section remains
a superior admixture of knowing reviews covering an eclectic range
of books and illuminating interviews with authors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Talbot realized that Salon could not survive as a
weekly given the speed of the Internet, and in February 1997 took
it daily. ``We realized that news drives traffic,'' Weir says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, news coverage mushroomed, driven by the elections
that year and seismic events like the death of Princess Diana that
drew huge spikes in readership. Talbot sees running room covering
the entertainment industry. Because publications like Entertainment
Weekly are owned by conglomerates, he argues, they will be less
likely to pursue aggressive investigations than the independent
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Salon had revenues of $6.2 million last year and expects to turn
a profit sometime next year. It raised $27 million in a public
offering and $15 million from private investors last year to pay
for its current hiring spree. But profits are elusive for dotcoms.
Buzz does not automatically morph into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot hopes to open a European operation based in London later
this year. CEO Michael O'Donnell is now in Europe talking to
institutional investors. He salivates over the $800 million worth
of online ads in the United Kingdom alone last year and remains
sanguine that an American operation can thrive in a cultural
collision with the Euros.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Salon sold 10 percent of itself last year
to Rainbow Media Holdings, the holding company for the Bravo
Network, the Independent Film Channel, and American Movie Classics.
It plans to air its own television show on Bravo in late summer.
Salon Radio, accessible on its home page, is also ramping up its
audio stream of talk and music to augment the online offerings. By
the end of the year, a reader will be able to hear Salon reporters,
reviewers, and columnists read their work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salon readership is soaring, according to its own
figures. It claims that 3.4 million people visited it in December,
up fivefold from the 650,000 during the previous December. Slate,
the more traditional online magazine of politics and commentary run
by former New Republic editor Michael Kinsley, disputes the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This food fight is based on dueling statistics. The industry
yardstick has been Media Metrix, the New York company that projects
totals based on a sample of users. By that measurement, Salon had
1.4 million in December; Slate had 900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salon says that the sample system grossly underestimates the
true numbers. As for Slate's charges? ``Sour grapes,'' says Patrick
Hurley, Salon's vice president for marketing. ``When's the last
time you heard someone talk about Slate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slate won't go around licking doorknobs,'' snaps Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   But it does advertise on Salon. Even more delicious for Salon
was CNN's refusal last year to air its television ad campaign on
the grounds that an online site was a direct competitor to the TV
network.
</P>
<P>
   Love that buzz. At the end of the day, though, Salon will rise
or fall on its credibility. ``Buzz is their ideology,'' Broder
says. ``Once the fascination in the Web ends, the old rules still
apply.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil weather will return to the Atlantic seaboard as high
pressure glides east through the Middle Atlantic region. The
clockwise circulation will draw cool, dry air into the Northeast
with ample sunshine along the coast, but some leftover clouds
inland. Fog will occupy valleys in the central Appalachians due to
light winds and residual moisture in the lowest layer of the
atmosphere. The Southeast will be bright and pleasant after a
chilly morning. Clouds may persist over southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A return flow of warmer air into the southern Plains will be
accompanied by clouds closer to the Gulf Coast. Readings will rise
more than 10 degrees above seasonal levels from Texas to southern
Missouri. A jet stream disturbance moving over the eastern Rockies
will combine with an ideal surface weather pattern to produce
strong downslope winds along the Front Range. Gusts may exceed 70
mph in the foothills.
</P>
<P>
   Light to moderate snow will fall from eastern Montana to
northern Wisconsin. Most sections will get an inch or two, but a
narrow swath may see as much as four inches. Low pressure tracking
east from Iowa will cause clouds to increase in the northern Ohio
Valley and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high pressure near Las Vegas, plenty of clouds will
cover the West. A fast flow aloft from the Pacific will bring
showers to northern California and Oregon. Snow levels will lower a
few hundred feet in the northern Sierra. The deserts will turn
warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Georgia Twisters
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes that ravaged southern Georgia on Sunday night were
insidious. Even though the region was placed under a tornado watch
as early as 6:30 p.m. Sunday, the twisters did not strike until
midnight. A cluster of severe thunderstorms moved across Mitchell
and Grady Counties as most residents had closed the book on their
weekend. Late-night tornadoes are an unfortunate aspect of life in
the Deep South. A swift current of air at 5,000 feet developed over
western Florida when the sun set. This low-level jet stream helped
give the necessary spin to spawn tornadoes despite the late hour.

NEW EMPHASIS IN CANCER DRUG TESTS: THE ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every winter in the frigid town of South Bend, Ind., Dr. Rafat
Ansari notices a definite increase in the number of his breast
cancer patients who choose to have mastectomies rather than
lumpectomies. The reason, he says, is quite simple.
</P>
<P>
   While the two treatments are equally effective in early breast
cancer, there are considerations that go beyond the medical, Ansari
said. With a mastectomy, in which a woman's entire cancerous breast
is removed, once the surgery is done, the treatment is complete.
</P>
<P>
   But women who have lumpectomies, in which just the cancerous
tumor is taken out, must have six weeks of ra treatments.
For many of Ansari's patients, elderly women living alone and
afraid to go out on the icy roads, the thought of the daily trek to
a radiation center is simply too much. They choose to have the
breast removed instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These little old ladies will tell you, `Six weeks of radiation
treatments? I'm not driving,''' said Ansari, a cancer specialist in
private practice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complication that was hardly dreamed of in the 1980s
when cancer researchers triumphantly announced that many women with
small tumors did not need to have mastectomies. But the large
national study that established this, like nearly every other
cancer study until now, had virtually no patients over 65.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what they say is an unprecedented initiative, cancer
researchers are designing studies specifically for older people.
The new approach, these researchers say, is forcing them to ask a
different sort of question. Instead of seeking the most aggressive
treatments, intended to keep cancer at bay for decades, they are
looking for the mildest treatments for people whose life expectancy
may be no more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That means asking whether radiation after lumpectomy extends
life for older women with breast cancer, whether chemotherapy is
helpful for elderly patients with colon cancer, lung cancer or
breast cancer, and whether mild chemotherapy is helpful for elderly
lung-cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer researchers say there is a great need for studies
focusing on the elderly. The typical cancer patient is not a parent
with school-age children, but a grandmother or grandfather living
alone or in a nursing home. For example, while a woman of 35 has a
one in 2,500 risk of developing breast cancer in the next year, a
75-year-old woman's risk is closer to one in 300, noted Dr. Hyman
Muss, a professor of medicine at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the aging of our population, the average cancer patient
is going to be 70 years old,'' said Dr. Bruce Chabner, the clinical
director of the cancer center at the Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston. ``But the average patient in clinical trials is 45 or
50.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger patients often want, and can tolerate, extremely
aggressive treatments. With decades of life before them, they have
every incentive to go to any length to try to wipe their cancers
out. That is why many have sought bone marrow transplants, a
regimen that used doses of chemotherapy drugs so high that only the
youngest and healthiest patients could survive them.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a suitable treatment for an 80-year-old woman with
heart disease or kidney disease or emphysema. Nor was it in demand
among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often people in this age group do not want aggressive
treatment,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Abrams, who coordinates breast cancer
trials at the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first attempts to address the needs of elderly cancer
patients was a study, sponsored by the cancer institute, that was
designed to help patients like Ansari's: If a patient is 70 or
older when breast cancer is discovered, can she get away with just
a lumpectomy and hormonal therapy with the anti-estrogen drug
tamoxifen? Are those six weeks of radiation really necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Another study, in which Chabner is participating, involves lung
cancer patients who are 70 and older, testing a mild chemotherapy
regimen with the drug taxol. ``It's relatively easy to take, and
nontoxic,'' Chabner said.
</P>
<P>
   But the breast cancer trial showed the way, cancer experts said.
Abrams said that an impetus for the trial was the cancer
institute's own data. Elderly women were not having lumpectomies.
Some researchers thought doctors were encouraging mastectomies
because they did not think older women cared about their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams said that often the women themselves were refusing
lumpectomies because of the problem of getting to a radiation
therapy center, or other medical problems that made radiation
therapy difficult for them.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Rahfeldt, an 84-year-old widow who lives alone in La
Porte, Ind., said she refused to consider radiation therapy when
she discovered a lump in her breast last December. It was not just
the inconvenience of radiation treatments, she said. She also
worried about her pacemaker. She did not want to have it removed
and reset after the radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor told her that her only option then was a mastectomy.
``I told him that if it came to that and it would be my life, then
to take the breast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer specialists said their elderly patients often refused
lumpectomies. Muss said: ``I have had patients who said, `Look,
dear, I live out in the country and I would be a tremendous burden
_ I prefer to have the mastectomy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Hughes, director of the breast center at the Lahey
Clinic in Burlington, Mass., observed, ``You very seldom run into a
50-year-old woman who says, `I don't want radiation therapy because
I can't drive back and forth.''' But, he added, ``For older women,
it was a recurring theme.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason to question the necessity of radiation for
elderly breast cancer patients, said Dr. Donald Berry, chairman of
the department of biostatistics at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston. Older women, he explained, tend to have less
aggressive, slower-growing tumors. And they often have other
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has breast cancer at age 70, they are probably not
going to die of breast cancer,'' Berry said. ``They're going to die
of something else.'' So he and others asked what is the gentlest
way to treat these patients and still give them the best chance of
surviving their cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lauren Schnaper, a surgeon who directs the comprehensive
breast care center at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, wrote
the protocol for the lumpectomy study, along with Hughes. But she
soon found that few doctors told their elderly patients that the
study was an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to convince physicians to enter their patients in
the study,'' Schnaper said. ``They told me it was a controversial
question.'' But Schnaper and others made persuading doctors their
mission, traveling to medical meetings and repeatedly urging
doctors to enroll patients.
</P>
<P>
   After five years, the researchers reached their goal: enrolling
640 women who were 70 or older when their breast cancers were
discovered and who had small tumors that had not spread beyond
their breasts. The women were randomly assigned to have a
lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy or lumpectomy alone. All
the women took tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is just a matter of waiting one to three years to see if
there is a difference in outcome between the women who had
radiation and those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Until the results are in, Abrams stressed, it is not known
whether older women can forgo radiation treatments after a
lumpectomy. ``We don't know the answer to the question yet and so
it remains unproven,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, researchers are moving to other questions of
particular interest to the elderly _ chemotherapy, for instance,
which was tested, once again, in populations that were
overwhelmingly middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemotherapy saves lives, but is it worth giving it to a woman
over 70?'' asked Muss. His group, he said, is designing trials in
elderly breast cancer patients to find out.

THEORIST PONDER A COSMIC BOOST FROM FAR, FAR AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The discovery two years ago that the expansion of the universe
is speeding up has presented physicists and cosmologists with a
major problem. The gravity of all the known matter and energy in
our own universe should slow that expansion, not speed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way out of this perplexity, several cosmologists
are now suggesting that the cosmic acceleration may be an effect
from some other universe.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmologists who have made this proposal concede that it is
a radical idea. But in identifying another, or parallel, universe
with extra dimensions that may exist beyond our own three spatial
and one time dimension, the cosmologists are on the cutting edge of
a trend in a branch of theoretical physics called superstring
theory.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andreas Albrecht, a cosmologist at the University of
California in Davis, said that all the simple ways of explaining
the astronomical observations had already been tried and have
failed. ``The data has thrown something at us that's deeply
puzzling and doesn't fit very well in any theoretical framework
that we have,'' he said. ``We're really venturing out into new
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The new idea comes in two parts, the first of which will be
published in the journal Physical Review Letters by Albrecht and
his Davis colleague, Constantinos Skordis. In their paper, they
showed that a strange kind of energy named quintessence, which has
been posited to permeate the universe, could develop into a
repulsive force at certain times, when it would accelerate the
cosmic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The second part involves the application of an advanced theory
called superstring theory, which portrays elementary particles not
as points but as wriggling, incredibly tiny 10-dimensional strings.
Many physicists hope superstring theory may one day show the
underlying unity of all forces in nature.
</P>
<P>
   New work suggests that the ability of some forms of quintessence
to flip from an attractive to a repulsive state could be connected
to a particularly bizarre and bedeviling prediction of string
theory, namely the existence of parallel universes, or
equivalently, different dimensions, that can nevertheless exert
forces on our own.
</P>
<P>
   If that were true, it would turn ``a problem of string theory
into a triumphant verification,'' said Dr. Joseph Lykken, a
physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Albrecht and Skordis, quintessence can be
thought of as a weak field of energy permeating space. Such fields
are a standard element in the physicist's toolbox and are a common
way of describing matter and energy mathematically.
</P>
<P>
   According to Einstein's equations of relativity, ordinary matter
and energy both exert normal, attractive gravity on each other, but
quintessence, if it exists, could also, under some circumstances,
exert an antigravity force.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessence considered by Albrecht, like ordinary matter,
normally exists in a humdrum, unsurprising attractive mode, and
becomes more tenuous in space as the universe expands. ``It sort of
shadows the behavior of the other matter,'' Albrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   But in its calculations the team discovered that any slight
change in how the quintessence is thinning out could temporarily
shift the gravity of the quintessence from normal to repulsive. The
switch would mean that the quintessence would stop slowing cosmic
expansion and start accelerating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can change its behavior due to little imperfections in its
behavior, which would lead to acceleration,'' Albrecht said. Just
what could cause such a bump in the cosmic road, the scientists did
not say.
</P>
<P>
   The string research suggesting just how all of this might happen
has not yet been published, but has been presented at conferences
by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Lawrence Hall, Hitoshi Murayama and Chris
Kolda at the University of California in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In superstring theory, different vibrations of the strings in 10
dimensions represent particles that carry all the known forces in
the universe, including gravity. But string theorists have long
wondered what to do with the extra six dimensions that we do not
perceive in our four-dimensional universe. If we do not see them,
where are they?
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to ``compactify'' them, or make them very small
and imperceptible. But some theorists have recently considered the
effects of making the extra dimensions larger. The extra dimensions
in the Berkeley theory would still be much smaller than an atomic
nucleus, but larger than compactified dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Arkani-Hamed and his colleagues have uncovered the astonishing
fact that stringy forces between some of those other dimensions and
our own could fill the universe with a kind of energy _ a
quintessence _ much like the one proposed by Albrecht and Skordis
to explain the acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quintessence is a very ghostly thing,'' but it could be
created by the interdimensional force, Arkani-Hamed said.
</P>
<P>
   The model could even account for the bumps, he added. New
theories of those extra dimensions consider that they have a finite
size, and when the other universe hits the end of the line, the
quintessence could change its character.
</P>
<P>
   To be taken seriously, the new suggestion would have to undergo
observational tests. Albrecht said that it may leave a signature on
the afterglow of the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave
background, but that such subtle features had not been observed
with present instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cosmologists are happy to find even a small ray of light
shining on a problem that has left them feeling benighted. ``This
is starting to look like real physics,'' Lykken said.

<P>
   For John V. Cody, 77, an artist in Lynnfield, Mass., it has been
two months and counting since his personal introduction to one of
the most unpleasant and underpublicized rites of getting older: a
bout of the shingles.
</P>
<P>
   At first the clustered blisters that sprouted on the left side
of his chest, then spread to his back, were just an annoyance. Now
the blisters are long healed, but they have left behind a
squeezing, crushing pain ``like a medieval torture device,'' he
said, that encases his chest and left upper arm, making sleep
difficult and work impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of doing the drawings he had planned to finish this
winter, Cody is spending his time doodling caricatures of his
shingles personified as a massive taloned monster gleefully
crushing its victim's left side.
</P>
<P>
   Cody is one of an estimated one million Americans who develop
shingles every year. Most are over 50, and many go on to suffer
months or even years of incapacitating pain. Behind their distress
is exactly the same virus that kept them out of school for a week
or two when they were children: the chickenpox, or varicella-zoster
virus, the only one of the common childhood bugs to develop a
malevolent second wind in later life.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, just as the fever and itchy blisters of
chickenpox were an inevitable part of childhood, shingles were
considered an unavoidable risk of old age, impossible to predict or
prevent and often accompanied by pain doctors have found
notoriously difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new research into the mechanisms of the pain are slowly
enabling better treatments. At the same time, researchers are
eagerly searching for older volunteers to help confirm a hunch that
the newly available chickenpox vaccine may not only prevent
chickenpox in children, but also the pain of shingles in adults.
</P>
<P>
   When children catch chickenpox, their rash scabs over within a
week or so and heals, but the virus does not leave the body. It
only retreats from view, moving from the skin back to large
clusters of nerve cells that lie on either side of the spinal cord.
There it lies dormant, kept in check by the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   If something goes wrong with the immune system years or decades
later _ something as serious as cancer or AIDS, or as common and
subtle as the normal changes in immunity that occur with aging _
the chickenpox virus can reactivate in a cluster of nerve cells and
begin to reproduce again, heading back out along delicate branching
filaments of the nerves to the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Once back in the skin, the virus causes exactly the same kind of
blisters as it did during the chickenpox, but only in the patch of
skin where the nerves with the virus have endings. The result is a
collection of blisters in one band of skin on the body, the result
of reactivated infection along the branches of a single group of
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``shingles'' is thought to derive from the Latin
``cingulum,'' a band or belt, describing both the bandlike form the
rash most commonly takes and the crushing vise-like pain that can
follow.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons the varicella virus prefers to hibernate in
the nerves that transmit pain and other sensations from the skin to
the spinal cord (where a second relay of nerves then transmits the
information to the brain for processing). As the virus reactivates
in these nerves, it can interfere with their normal functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Unless shingles is on the face and affects the eye, the rash
usually goes away after several weeks without complications. But
about 50 percent of people over age 60 have persistent pain in the
area that lasts long after the shingles fade.
</P>
<P>
   This pain means that shingles can undermine health as profoundly
as any life-threatening illness, said Richard T. Perkin, president
of the V.Z.V. Research Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group for
patients with chickenpox and shingles in New York City. Severe,
profound debilitation, depression and even suicide may follow the
shingles, Perkin said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists are still trying to figure out why the pain of
shingles can be so persistent, and often so difficult to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pain may result from a chaotic tangle of ``crossed
wires'' in the brain and spinal cord, said Dr. Anne Louise
Oaklander, a neurologist and pain specialist at Harvard Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   The reactivation of the varicella virus in nerves that control
pain and sensation often winds up destroying those nerves.
Oaklander's research has shown that people with severe
post-shingles pain have lost 80 percent or more of sensory nerve
endings in affected skin.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of so many nerves may cause an electrical chaos in the
spinal cord that is interpreted by the brain as overwhelming pain.
In fact, Oaklander has started calling post-shingles pain ``phantom
skin pain,'' an analogy to the neurologic paradox called ``phantom
limb pain,'' in which people feel they are experiencing
excruciating pain in an arm or leg that has been amputated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Oaklander said, other nerves in the skin that
normally transmit sensations of temperature or pressure, but not
pain, can become confused after an episode of shingles and start to
transmit pain too. As a result, patients with post-shingles pain
can find the light pressure of bedclothes, and even the touch of
clothing, excruciatingly painful.
</P>
<P>
   The pain from shingles is complicated enough that doctors are
learning not to expect ordinary painkillers like aspirin or
ibuprofen to help. Instead, a double-barrelled approach to pain
control often works best.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael C. Rowbotham, a neurologist who directs the Pain
Clinical Research Center at the University of California at San
Francisco, often starts treatment with a newly available device
called a lidocaine patch, a stretchy bandage that holds a
long-acting topical anesthetic next to the skin. That quiets the
affected nerve endings so that at least the patient can wear
clothing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rowbotham usually adds oral treatments. Antidepressant
drugs and drugs that control seizures can help stabilize
erratically functioning nerves and can be effective in taking the
edge off shingles pain until it goes away by itself (ususally
within six months). Narcotic drugs related to codeine and morphine
can also help. Still, while these treatments often ease pain, they
seldom abolish it entirely, Rowbotham said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers think they may already have the tool for eradicating
post-shingles pain before it begins. That tool is the chickenpox
vaccine, which was licensed for use in the United States in 1995,
is already reducing cases of chickenpox in some communities by as
much as 90 percent, epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine contains a weakened strain of the chickenpox virus
that research suggests is still strong enough to boost older
adults' waning immunity against the chickenpox virus. When adults
who have received the vaccine develop shingles, they appear to have
notably mild cases, without protracted pain.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious plan to see if this pattern holds is now under way,
as researchers call for 37,000 volunteers from all over the country
to join a study of the chickenpox vaccine in men and women over 60
who had chickenpox as children.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free phone number (1-877-841-6251) will direct those
interested in participating to the nearest enrollment center. Half
the enrollees will be given the chickenpox vaccine and half a
placebo vaccine, and the rates of shingles and pain afterward will
be monitored in both groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shingles can be a very painful and long-lasting illness,''
said Dr. Myron J. Levin, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at
the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, who is
overseeing the study.
</P>
<P>
   The best testimonial that he thinks the vaccine is safe and may
work: ``I'm in the study myself,'' Levin said.

   CAMILLA, Ga. _ Tornadoes tore through a section of southwest
Georgia overnight, killing more than 20 people and injuring at
least 100, shearing off roofs, uprooting statuesque pecan trees and
snapping off pines like toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy E. Barnes flew over the hardest-hit areas in a
helicopter Monday and reported that an estimated 200 to 300 houses
had been struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a swath about 10 miles long and 1 and a half miles
wide,'' Barnes said. ``There's a mobile home park on the south side
of town that just looks like a bomb drooped. It's just flattened,
nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the area, heavily forested with pine, is fairly rural
and sparsely populated, the few available hospitals were flooded
beyond capacity, and victims were sent as far as 100 miles away to
Tallahassee, Fla., for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the damage and fatalities occurred here in Mitchell
County, but the governor said one of the deaths took place in Grady
County and another in Tift County. The worst destruction and
injuries were in Camilla in the mobile home park, which was
off-limits to the press Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of rescue workers, law enforcement officers and utilities
technicians were called in from surrounding counties to help.
Search and rescue operations were continuing Monday under a hot sun
and puffy clouds as residents surveyed the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Near the mobile home park, in a neighborhood of mostly brick
ranch houses, several roofs had been completely torn off by the
tornado, which struck at about midnight on Sunday. It blasted
through the middle of one house, obliterating the center section
but leaving a wing standing on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Woodward, 57, a retiree, said he and his wife rode out
the storm huddled in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it lasted forever,'' he said of the tornado,
``but it was probably pretty quick. I've never prayed so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He said bad weather was what drove him and his wife to move to
Georgia from the St. Petersburg area. ``We moved up here from
Florida to get away from the hurricanes. We got flooded out twice
by the storm surges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said only three or four of the 39 trees on his one-acre
lot remained standing Monday morning. Windows were broken, a
section of a pine tree lay on his roof, and a gray plastic trash
can was suspended from the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also felled trees and caused minor damage to the home
of Gail G. Swindle, 60, a self-employed image consultant. ``I heard
popping, then the shingles flying off the roof and then the
roaring, like a train but louder. Then I heard all the trees
snapping. I got my pocketbook, the cell phone, the car keys and got
in the tub'' for safety, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrifying. It's the most helpless feeling because
there's nothing you can do. You just have to go with it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Go ahead and laugh at the funny
racewalkers. Everyone else does.
</P>
<P>
   But with resting heart rates of around 40, they will be
swiveling their hips and striding across the graves of those who
mocked them. That's a lot of ground to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Usually held in ridicule as a second cousin once removed from
traditional track and field events, racealkers soldier on in their
unwavering heel-toe style in near absolute obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of them braved horrendous conditions Sunday morning as
they competed for three spots on the U.S. Olympic team in the
50-kilometer racewalk trials held along a 2.5-kilometer course on
State University Drive on the Sacramento State campus.
</P>
<P>
   In this part of the world, accomplished with a rigid form that
requires the heel of one foot and the toe of the other to be in
contact with the ground at all times. Failure to do so results in
warnings (two) followed by disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite, 32-year-old Curt Clausen of Chula Vista in San
Diego County, slogged through wind and rain and temperatures that
felt much colder than the listed 50 degrees to become the country's
first track and field Olympian for Sydney 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He crossed the finish in 3 hours, 56 minutes and 16 seconds. On
a day in which earthworms could be seen floating along in tiny
rowboats, it was remarkable that Clausen and runner-up Andrew
Herman (3:57:54) broke four hours, the ``A'' qualifying standard
for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the absolute worst conditions I've ever raced in,'' said
Herman, also of Chula Vista. ``The wind is what killed us. We lost
so much time on that. That could have affected times by as much as
five or six minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clausen and Herman were motoring along in metronomic
fashion _ heel-toe, heel-toe, heel-toe. Take note, recreational
joggers: Clausen's winning pace averaged about 7:30 per mile ...
for 31 consecutive miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, at the finish, I broke into tears,'' Clausen said. ``I
was happy to be over with it, happy to make the team. There's lots
of time to train hard with my teammates, race against the best in
the world and kick butt in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Clausen, Herman and third-placer Philip Dunn (4:07:00) all live
and train at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, where they
are coached by an Ecuadorean Enrique Pena, who is regarded as among
the best in the world at his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Starting late in 1998, Pena got Clausen to change his training
and technique to become more efficient at both. Clausen altered the
carriage of his arms, which accounts for the swiveling of the hips,
and stepped up the intensity of his workouts to 166 heartbeats a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The results? Clausen stunned the racewalking community (pop. 27)
by finishing fourth at last year's World Championships in Seville,
Spain. It was the highest finish by an American in World or Olympic
competition in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 100 percent responsible for my making the jump to the
international level,'' Clausen said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 35 kilometers of Sunday morning's race, Clausen,
Herman, Dunn and another Chula Vista teammate, Al Heppner, formed
the lead pack and took turns leading into the wind to make it
easier on the others.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dunn was hit with screaming pain in his right hamstring at
36 kilometers. He rested a few seconds, then continued on, slowly,
until he was able to return to form. Along the way, Dunn passed the
fading Heppner, who dropped out after 40 kilometers with acute
hypothermia that required medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very sudden,'' Dunn said. ``I literally had to stop, it
was such severe pain. I stopped for about five or 10 seconds, then
very slowly started marching again. I spent the next two k's
working myself back into it. Mentally I never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   After crossing the finish in third place to earn a trip to
Sydney, Dunn said he felt ``pure elation. Absolutely thrilled. The
work I put in this year made it all worthwhile for spending the
last seven years dedicated to racewalking.''
</P>
<P>
   You might question the sanity of these men for stepping out in
such hellish conditions but for what they do and how they do it,
they are to be admired, not mocked.
</P>
<P>
   Walk on.

A SHALLOW VIEW OF GAYS IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ASSAULT ON GAY AMERICA 
Produced by: Claudia Pryor Malis 
On: WGBH, Tuesday at 10 p.m 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To probe the nature of homophobia in the nation, Tuesday's
``Frontline'' report, ``Assault on Gay America,'' recounts the 1999
murder of Billy Jack Gaither. A solid citizen of Sylacauga, Ala.,
the 39-year-old Gaither was well-liked, hard-working, and discreet
about his homosexuality, though not closeted. Last February, he was
beaten and stabbed to death in a horrible homicide that seems like
an outtake from ``Goodfellas,'' although the pair of men convicted
in the killing, and now serving life sentences, weren't mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Both allege in interview footage shown in the program that
Gaither died because of sexual advances he made that offended their
manhood. Steven Mullins, who apparently wielded the murder weapons,
clearly implies he did the correct thing under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   According to research on homophobia that this ``Frontline''
reviews, his attitudes are woven into the fabric of contemporary
American culture.
</P>
<P>
   This assertion hardly comes as a surprise, and, unfortunately,
the conclusions of the experts who appear on the program are just
as predictable. Dr. Karen Franklin, for example, explains that
young males display hostility toward gay men ``to prove their
masculinity.'' On the basis of a questionable-looking study, a
Georgia psychologist demonstrates what Freud long ago suggested _
that many of the most vehement antigay males have homosexual
impulses themselves. (And, as it happens, Mullins may have had a
secret homosexual life himself.)
</P>
<P>
   The murder story at the heart of ``Assault on Gay America'' is
sad and shocking, but the program doesn't tell us much more about
the roots of this crime and others like it than we already know.
Furthermore, it raises several questions it has an obligation to
address, but never does _ notably, why have antihomosexual hate
crimes increased in recent years and what is being done, and can be
done better, to combat them?

<P>
   Before they could even vote or control their own property, women
had reached for the stars _ and rigorously picked them apart. For
more than a century, they have earned at least 10 percent of the
doctorates in astronomy, often to luminous ends. In 1908, for
example, Henrietta Levitt discovered Cepheid variable stars, which
have proved crucial to the measurement of cosmic distances. Some 25
years later, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin determined that stars are
composed mainly of hydrogen _ a finding that her colleagues at
first refused to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with all that history and momentum behind them, female
astronomers still have not soared to professional heights in the
numbers that might be expected. At a recent meeting of the American
Astronomical Society in Atlanta, researchers presented results from
new surveys of the status of women in astronomy, including one that
canvassed virtually all astronomy departments in the United States
and another that focused on 36 of the nation's larger and more
prominent astronomy graduate programs. They compared the latest
data with similar surveys taken in 1992, and thus were able to
assess women's progress during a span that has been a boom time for
astronomy as much as it has for the economy over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Hubble Space Telescope and other advances, there's a
lot of excitement in the field now, and a lot of stuff for people
to do,'' said Dr. C. Megan Urry, an astronomer at the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who conducted the surveys
and presented the data in Georgia. ``We're in a golden age of
astronomy and cosmology.'' As a result, she said, the total number
of people with Ph.D.'s in astronomy rose 40 percent in the last
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for aspiring female astronomers, even the gold age
appears to be alloyed with disparities. And though many observers
in and around the discipline have the impression that affirmative
action programs in particular, and academic ``political
correctness'' in general, unfairly give women the edge when it
comes to hiring and promotion decisions, the new survey results
suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men, and some young women, often think that women are
being preferentially hired these days,'' Urry said. ``Our data show
that's not the case. If anything, it's the opposite.'' Women at the
highest levels of the field remain a rarity: only 5 percent of the
nation's full professors in astronomy are female. Among newcomers
to the field, though, women abound, currently accounting for 25
percent of the doctorates awarded in astronomy each year.
</P>
<P>
   But women start leaking out of the career pipeline early on.
About 43 percent of the men who were in graduate school in 1992
managed to obtain postdoctoral fellowships in the institution of
their choice, compared with only 26 percent of the women. Among the
elite universities, 60 percent of the male graduate students won
coveted postdoctoral appointments in the same institution, while
only 50 percent of the female Ph.D.'s were selected to stay on as
postgraduates.
</P>
<P>
   When young astronomers seek tenure-track faculty positions, a
few more women vanish; they go from being 17 percent of the
nation's postdoctoral fellows to 15 percent of the new assistant
professors.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows why women are not advancing swiftly in a discipline
that has long attracted them. Conference presenters admitted that
conditions for women are vastly better today than they were 50
years ago, when the great astronomer Margaret Burbidge was refused
a Carnegie fellowship because women were not allowed to use the
Mount Wilson telescope or any of the other Carnegie observatories.
</P>
<P>
   And astronomy is hardly alone among the sciences in its poor
showing of women at the top. According to a study published in The
New England Journal of Medicine last week, women who teach in
medical schools are less likely than men to be promoted at each
step along the career path from assistant to full professor, even
though they are more likely to go into academic medicine to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that any effort to push women ahead even faster is
doomed to fail, because, they say, the female talent and desire
just is not there. In the January issue of Status, a biannual
report on women in astronomy published by the American Astronomical
Society, the editors reprinted an article by David Gelernter, a
professor of computer science at Yale University, which originally
appeared in the conservative Weekly Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women aren't being kept out of science by force, they must
be choosing not to enter, presumably because they don't want to,''
Gelernter wrote, ``presumably because (by and large) they don't
like these fields or (on average) don't tend to excel in them,
which is nearly the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're also less prone to the intense, cut-throat
aggressiveness that usually marks the successful research scientist
or engineer,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Urry does not buy either the free choice or the wilting lily
arguments. ``Getting a Ph.D. in a science like astronomy is very,
very difficult,'' she said. ``You have to be in love with it, and
be really interested in it and dedicated to finish. The notion that
after spending five, six, seven grinding years working like dog,
and then saying, `oh, that was fun, now I choose to do something
else' _ well, I don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Overt discrimination is rare or absent, Urry and others said.
Instead, they point to small slights and acts of benign neglect as
the likeliest culprits in women's career lag _ the molehills that,
as Virginia Valian put it in her book, ``Why So Slow? The
Advancement of Women,'' (MIT Press, 1999) gradually accrete into
mountains.

</P>
<P>
   The publication Status presented some women's testimony in its
two most recent issues, which can be found online at www.aas.org: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _``I am on a postdoctoral search committee at a university
astronomy department. I read about 100 applications, each of which
has typically three letters of recommendation. One letter, written
by a male faculty member for a female applicant, emphasizes twice
how tiny, sweet and charming the applicant is, and gives a specific
example of how amusing and cute it is to watch the applicant in the
laboratory wrestling with astronomical equipment larger than she.''
</P>
<P>
   _``A new chair has been hired for our physics and astronomy
department. Three of the 40 faculty members are women. He addresses
his very first faculty memo to `Dear Gentlemen ...'
</P>
<P>
   _``A senior scientist and fellow Italian citizen, whom I know
well but have not seen in several years, visits the institution
where I am on the faculty. I say hello, and he replies, asking if I
could take his clothes to the dry cleaner. ... I declined to run
his errand.''
</P>
<P>
   _``At a conference I approach two male colleagues in my field,
wanting to introduce myself to the senior astronomer whose work
closely parallels mine. I hope to join their conversation about a
science issue with which I am very familiar. After continuing their
conversation for a few minutes, the senior astronomer finally turns
from his counterpart and addresses me, saying, `Ah, but we are
boring this sweet young girl. What can I do for you, dear?'
</P>
<P>
   _``I have just passed my Ph.D. oral exam, a follow-up to the
written exam which was taken days earlier. A well-intentioned
senior male faculty member approaches me with a handshake and
remarks, `I am very proud of your accomplishment, knowing how hard
astronomy and physics is, especially for a woman ...'''
</P>
<P>
   _``As a young postdoc in a high-powered physics department, I
attend a colloquium by a famous French man in which the opening
slide is a topless dancer in a grass skirt on a Hawaiian beach.
Some guys laugh and one female graduate student leaves quietly from
the back. I myself am torn _ I do not want to appear humorless or
to overreact (cultural norms being different in France, for one
thing), and I want very much to hear the talk, but after 20 minutes
I realize I have not heard a word he said after that awful picture.
. . . The speaker, by the way, later wins a prestigious prize named
for a famous woman scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this surprises Urry. Recently, she said, as she was
putting together materials to bolster the case for her promotion to
full astronomer, Urry was advised by a colleague to exclude mention
of her work on behalf of women in astronomy. ``Normally, taking a
leadership position is seen as a plus,'' she said. ``It's good to
be a leader in anything but this.''
</P>
<P>
   Urry ignored the advice.

LETTERMAN PLANS RETURN TO `LATE SHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the reigning ironist of our time, David Letterman has always
affected a blase air about hosting a network TV show. His shrug
seemed to say: Hey, it's only television.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't know what you've got till it's gone, as the song
goes, and Letterman apparently missed ``The Late Show with David
Letterman'' so much that he will return Friday, just five weeks
after undergoing open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave got a rare opportunity to experience what it would be
like not to do this,'' Rob Burnett, executive producer of ``The
Late Show,'' said Monday. ``The experience has absolutely made him
miss the job completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, slated to air Monday night, will kick off a gradual,
step-by-careful-step comeback by the 52-year-old comedian. In a
nicely symmetrical touch, Letterman's first guest will be Regis
Philbin, the last guest he had before his Jan. 14 surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But Letterman himself will clearly be the star of the show, and
yes, the fabled ``Top Ten'' list will be stocked with jokes about
Dave's surgery.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with TV critics, Burnett predicted that
Letterman will ``have a lot to say about everything that's been
going on.'' After all, he noted, ``You have an unusual circumstance
and you have five weeks of gathering stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusual circumstance is right. Fans were rocked last month by
the news that Letterman, who has shaped the late-night landscape
for two decades with a stream of innovations and a nonchalant
persona that appealed to a young audience, had undergone emergency
quintuple-bypass heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's relatively speedy return will gladden the hearts of
CBS executives, since the comeback show, with an expected huge
audience, will fall within the February ratings ``sweeps'' period.
</P>
<P>
   However, the long-term picture remains unclear. Burnett
indicated that he and Letterman may discuss whether it makes sense
to switch to a four-nights-a-week schedule a la Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, Letterman is easing back into the host's chair
very gradually, and will not be back at work full-time for an
indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
   The show he tapes on Friday will air next Monday night. Then, on
Tuesday, Bill Cosby will fill in as guest host _ the first time in
Letterman's 18 years in late night that he has relied on a guest
host for an all-new program. (Cosby will not do the Top Ten list,
however. ``Cosby did not want to do one; he feels that's Dave's
material,'' said Burnett).
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Letterman is expected to be back as host, with
Julia Roberts as a guest, before he gives way Thursday night to
Philbin, who will sit in as guest host. It's unlikely that
Letterman will host next Friday's show, but it's not yet known who
the guest host will be.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of many unknowns as Letterman completes what
Burnett acknowledged is ``an extremely quick recovery'' that has
involved daily 90-minute hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said that Letterman ``medically is fine, couldn't be
better, perfect,'' but added that ``what he doesn't know is how
well he'll feel after hosting a network television show.''
Letterman and his doctors will decide how many nights per week he
hosts the show. ``We'll work our way back as slowly as Dave needs
to work back,'' said Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   The producer indicated that the alternation of Letterman and
guest hosts will continue for some time as the host and his doctors
monitor his recovery. Also, Burnett said, the program is unlikely
ever to revert to its old practice of taping two shows on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   During his recuperation, Letterman has received cards and good
wishes from President Clinton, from Carson, and from numerous
celebrities and fans. ``I told him that personally I believe he has
become a national treasure, and he tried to fire me,'' joked
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``The Late Show'' without David Letterman has
subsisted surprisingly well in the ratings, thanks in part to a new
format adopted in the past week where celebrities taped new
segments that were juxtaposed with reruns of their previous
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rerun segments was Philbin's guest appearance on Jan.
13, during which Letterman _ who was about to undergo an
angioplasty that eventually led to surgery _ anxiously queried
Philbin about the latter's experience with the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said that the new format ``was a nice little twist in
sweeps.'' He said CBS executives have emphasized that Letterman's
health is their top priority, but acknowledged television's
bottom-line reality by saying of the comeback shows: ``Sweeps is
sweeps, and it's a business. It'll be a nice boon to everybody that
probably the last eight days of sweeps, we'll achieve powerful
ratings.''

&HT;     HOW TO HELP THE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How can the outdoor experience be improved in
the San Francisco Bay Area?
</P>
<P>
   At the Sportsmen's Expo last weekend, hundreds of people
provided suggestions for improving hiking, fishing, boating, biking
and conservation. Along with some of my own suggestions, here is a
synopsis of the comments:
</P>
<P>
   _ The San Francisco watershed lands should immediately be opened
up to hiking on existing service roads, just as already the case at
many water district lands in Marin and the East Bay foothills. That
would provide access to 23,000 acres of land on the Peninsula and
38,000 acres of land adjacent to the Ohlone Regional Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Supporting Proposition 12, the Safe Parks Bond Act, is the No.
1 thing hikers can do for parks and greenbelt, protecting open
space in the foothills from urban sprawl, as well as providing
funds for parks, recreation, and fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   _ The addition of back-country hike-in camps at parks throughout
the Bay Area foothills would provide outstanding and needed
close-to-home opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the 10 parks along Skyline managed by the Midpeninsula Open
Space District, leashed dogs should be permitted on the trails,
just as is the case on lands governed by the Marin Water District
and East Bay Regional Park District.
</P>
<P>
   corral
</P>
<P>
   _ An aquatic habitat program can be established for San
Francisco Bay, starting with the barren South Bay, where concrete
from roadbed projects can be used to construct underwater reefs,
which can then be marked with buoys.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trout plants can be doubled at 10 lakes in the Bay Area
foothills by the Department of Fish and Game simply by providing
fingerlings in submerged net pens in the fall, then having local
clubs grow the fish out to larger sizes for release in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ At another 10 lakes now offering zilch, a warm-water fisheries
program can be established that would provide abundant prospects
for bass, bluegill, crappie and catfish.
</P>
<P>
   _ The perfect location to construct new boat ramps, marinas and
parking areas is the undeveloped area south of the Bay Bridge along
the San Francisco waterfront. Such a plan should be advanced
immediately by the Department of Boating and Waterways.
</P>
<P>
   _ While they're at it, grants should be ordered for maintenance
dredging of boat ramps in the South Bay at Palo Alto and Alviso,
closed for years from the influx of silt.
</P>
<P>
   _ These projects can be easily paid for by the perpetual budget
surplus of Boating and Waterways, the result of guaranteed income
from 900,000 boat registrations and too few places to spend the
dough (and commonly raided by other agencies).
</P>
<P>
   _ And, of course: The oil companies must be forced to
immediately get the additive MTBE out of the gas.
</P>
<P>
   _ In order to find a place to play (and a solution for current
trail conflicts) a bike-only park with narrow one-way trails should
be created for highly skilled mountain bikers who are capable of
ripping at warp speed on single track. Similar one-use parks for
motorcyclists with dirt bikes have been created in the Central
Valley with great success.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the same time, park rangers should enforce existing laws
with zero tolerance and high penalties if bikers are caught on
closed trails.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only creating bike lanes on the country roads in the Bay Area
foothills will end the dangerous encounters between bikes and
speeding cars.
</P>
<P>
   _ How about a coordinated, first-ever crackdown by all
enforcement agencies on littering, that is, sticking it to the
litterbugs with the maximum $1,000 fine, with the worst problem
areas being parking areas with views and at lakes with shoreline
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any inhumane treatment of animals must be stopped, the
violators arrested and punished, starting with the Chinatown
markets in San Francisco and Oakland, where live turtles, frogs and
even armadillos are often treated in horrendous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any driver of a personal watercraft endangering other boaters
or wildlife should be quarantined in the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   _ All tidepools on the coast should be off-limits to the take of
snails, hermit crabs, starfish and other invertebrates. Groups of
10 and 15 people, each with a 5-gallon bucket, have been seen
combing through the tidepools, taking every living thing they can
find.

 &HT;    U.S. UNVEILS PLAN TO IMPROVE SHARING OF DRUG-TRAFFICKING DATA
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Monday introduced a
plan for sharing information about drug trafficking that it says
will greatly help in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The General Counterdrug Intelligence Plan was unveiled by
representatives of eight federal agencies, including the CIA, the
Justice Department and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The $186 million program will build a data base of information
on seized drugs and improve the government's ability to provide
information to every facet of the law enforcement community, Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, head of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also aims to improve cooperation among federal, state
and local law enforcement agencies, and maps out ways to improve
the cooperation of U.S. and international partners in the fight
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do so much if we use the tools that have been
developed in this plan and use them wisely,'' said Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight against narcotics is a top priority for American
intelligence, and the plan is a great move for Americans,'' said
deputy CIA director Gen. John Gordon. ``The entire (intelligence)
community is 100 percent behind this effort, and we will do our
very best'' to make sure that it succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is based on a study by a White House task force
commissioned in 1997. Seven cabinet departments and five federal
law enforcement agencies, as well as state and local law
enforcement organizations and the National Security Council, worked
to turn the task force's 89 recommendations into 73 separate
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides sharing drug intelligence and improving coordination
among different levels of U.S. and foreign governments, the
initiatives include personnel development, training, and
information technology.

 &HT;    Secrets to Lasting Love Shared
 &HT;    By STEPHANIE ALLMON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When Marjorie and A.A. Hyden sit down to eat, they
light a candle on the table, just as they have since their first
Christmas together in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do candles make eating more fun, the Hydens say, but
they also help fan the flames of romance after 52 years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our love is still growing,'' Marjorie Hyden said. ``The
wonderful thing about us is we are roommates, we're friends, we're
sweethearts and we're lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun. Romance. Togetherness. All are characteristics _ and habits
_ that help love to mature over the years, said Ben Dickerson,
director of the Institute for Gerontological Studies at Baylor
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think love certainly deepens,'' he said. ``I think the love
matures, and it's important to have both a romantic love and a
mature love.''
</P>
<P>
   Most couples' love changes as their lives do, he said. When they
are young, they may focus on their children or their careers and
not as much on each other. But when they retire and the kids move
out, their relationship may take on altogether new dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Ruth Murff, who celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary
in October, said they enjoy the activities they can do together now
that their four children are grown. Ed, 70, and Ruth, 68, like to
play bridge, travel and just sit down and talk.
</P>
<P>
   The way they converse with each other is different now, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more open because it's just us two now,'' Ruth Murff
said. ``We have more time. We don't have as much pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Murffs say their fairy-tale continues to come true every
day. Growing up as children of strict farmers, divorce was not a
word they heard.
</P>
<P>
   Having that commitment level and having respect for each other
helped them celebrate the high points and endure the low points of
their marriage, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make the commitment, you have to give a lot and take
a lot,'' Ruth Murff said. ``There's good and bad times for
everybody, but these times can be worked through. It's important to
be open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hydens agreed that being honest and respecting each other's
opinions are paramount to making love last through the years.
</P>
<P>
   They got married when they were both in their 30s and never had
children. So they focused their attention on their careers _ hers
as a counselor and teacher, and his as a college administrator _
and on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing important for young people is to have a general
interest in each other's welfare,'' A.A. Hyden said. ``We have
enjoyed helping each other and we enjoyed sitting down at night and
talking about our professions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in their post-retirement years, Marjorie and A.A., both in
their 80s, enjoy entertaining together and watching their favorite
sports teams, the Baylor University Bears, the San Antonio Spurs
and the Denver Broncos. And they take care of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was thinking about retiring, a lot of people said,
`What will you do?' '' A.A. Hyden said. ``I think it's just a real
joy to help (Marjorie).''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed before they were married that they would never go to
bed angry at each other. And they say they never have reason to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never had a fuss,'' Marjorie said.
</P>
<P>
   And even they are surprised at that, since they say they are
both forthright and opinionated.
</P>
<P>
   One more ingredient to the Hydens' recipe for lasting love is
affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we kiss once, we kiss a hundred times,'' Marjorie said,
patting A.A. on the hand. ``We're the kissingest people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the American Association of
Retired Persons, seniors say affection is an important element in
their relationships. According to the survey, 67 percent of men and
61 percent of women reported their partners as ``extremely'' or
``very'' satisfying in a physical relationship. And 70 percent of
men and 62 percent of women reported high emotional satis- faction.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the AARP magazine Modern Maturity,
psychologist James Hillman said the capacity for love to deepen is
almost a mysterious phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learn to give one another more space, to take more interest
in what's going on in each other's life,'' he said. ``Not what
medications we're taking, or what our pulse rates might be, but
what we're reading and dreaming about, what memories are returning
to us, what peculiar reflection just turned in our minds _
something we haven't thought of for years. We become more
interested in each other's souls; that's the interesting part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hydens still have the candle from their first Christmas
together. In 1947, Marjorie made the ``drip candle'' by placing a
candle inside a can. Every time it burned, the wax would drip down
the sides and create a hole in the middle for a new candle. For 52
years, they have been adding candles, which have melted and dripped
into one that stands about 6 feet high on a coffee table in their
living room.
</P>
<P>
   They Hydens say their ``friendship candle'' is a metaphor for
how their love continues to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we go another 50 years, it'll hit the ceiling,''
Marjorie said.

 &HT;    Compatibility key to long-term unions
 &HT;    By STEPHANIE ALLMON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There's a new status symbol in America, and it
can't be bought with plastic or polished with wax. Long-term
marriages are now as coveted as designer clothes and luxury cars,
the Wall Street Journal has reported.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no wealth or privilege attached to the luxury of a
long-term marriage. In fact, the chances of achieving it are the
same for everyone _ about 50/50.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of all marriages end in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to the Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples
Education, Americans say that a happy marriage is their No. 1 goal,
and 85 to 90 percent will get married at least once.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a formula for overcoming the odds and reversing the
divorce trend, marriage and family experts say it must include
better preparation before the ``I do's'' and stronger commitment ``
'til death do us part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (marriage) is going to be alive and well,'' said
Preston Dyer, professor and chairman of the school of social work
at Baylor University. ``But I think it will be a lot harder to make
long-term marriages work in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who team-teaches a marriage and family course at Baylor
with his wife of 40 years, Genie, said demanding work schedules and
the fast pace of life can take its toll on marriages. And with
Americans working longer hours than ever and putting increasing
importance on careers, married couples in the future will have to
consciously make more time for each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriages just gradually fall apart,'' he said. ``All of a
sudden, people wake up and they're just not connected to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples Education reports
that by the time people make it to marriage counseling, it is
usually too late to save the marriage. Only 50 percent who go to
therapy are helped, the coalition reports. Of these couples, 30
percent relapse within two years, which means that only 20 percent
receive lasting positive results.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of ``saving'' a marriage, couples should take
measures to better prepare themselves for married life, Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts,
husband-and-wife team and psychologists Les and Leslie Parrott say
marriage problems arise because ``we marry an image and only later
discover the real person.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also the premise behind the new book, The Marital
Compatibility Test. Author Susan Adams, who has been married three
times herself, suggests that often it's the seemingly little issues
in life that turn marital bliss into marital discord. Her book
poses hundreds of questions about everyday life _ from how long
leftovers should remain in the refrigerator, to how much stereo
equipment should cost.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not for couples to agree on everything but to
understand each other's habits and prepare to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have different definitions for words, like a `clean
house' and `early,' '' Adams said. ``I like to think (the test) is
to show that both people have equal input and both people's needs
are going to be considered in each decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Concepts like a compatibility test and premarital counseling
demonstrate a smarter kind of love that Dyer predicts couples in
the 21st century will practice. Instead of getting wrapped up in
romance and red roses, he predicts people will take a more mature
approach and think about long-term implications of getting married.
</P>
<P>
   And this attitude, he says, is one manifestation of a more
educated, independent generation of men and women getting married
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A young adult is) having a sense, particularly for a woman,
that I can make it by myself, I don't have to get married, but I
can freely make the choice to join my life with another person,''
Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Because people are more cautious about marriage and want to live
independently, the average age of a person's first marriage has
continued to increase. Now at age 26 to 27, it's higher than it's
ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting married around (age) 26 or 27 seems to be the age that
correlates highest with marital success,'' he said. ``People's
values have settled down, they have more financial security, they
are probably a bit more independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason people are waiting longer to marry, Adams said,
is that they have lived through devastation from their parents'
divorce. Statistics say that children of divorced parents have a
greater chance of getting divorced themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That's another reason for people to be smarter about love, and
about the person with whom they choose to share their life, Dyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I am convinced of is that more marriages fail as a
result of faulty mate selection than because of anything that
occurs after the marriage actually takes place,'' he said. ``The
first step in having a good marriage is being careful about
choosing a marriage partner.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells his students that when they choose a partner, they
should rely only 50 percent on hormones, and 50 percent on
intellect and logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we base so much of our mate selection on physical
attraction,'' he said. ``And so in many ways, we ignore other signs
that would say this is not a good relationship or doesn't have good
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   What are those signs?
</P>
<P>
   Having some differences, but being alike in a lot of ways.
Couples don't have to share all of each other's interests and
activities, but they must have enough in common to provide some
bonding enjoyment, Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   One mistake couples make is marrying a best friend or someone
with whom they are sexually compatible, Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Other frequent mistakes people make are marrying someone so a
child can have a parent, marrying for financial stability and
marrying someone only after a long-distance courtship, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good motive doesn't make a good marriage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So some people are finding other options for their
relationships. In her book The Future of Love, author and therapist
Daphne Rose Kingma predicts that new forms of committed
relationships will emerge both inside and outside the boundaries of
matrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Co-habitation, same-sex marriages, sacred friendships,
cross-generational pairings and triangle relationships are other
forms of commitment that people will seek to fulfill their souls'
desires for relationships, she says in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer would add commuter marriages, voluntary childlessness and
voluntary singleness to that list.
</P>
<P>
   But overwhelmingly, the American dream still includes marriage
and family, even if it seems like another gamble to take in an
already insecure world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think marriage ought to be a port in a storm,'' Dyer said.
``We live in the storm from day to day with deadlines and meeting
quotas and competitiveness. But there needs to be a place in our
lives that can serve as a port in a storm for us, and that means
partners being available to each other.''

 &HT;    Children who changed the world
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When 7-year-old Brittany Fuller told her mother that
she wanted to meet her idol, Ruby Bridges, it didn't click.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's mother, Kamala Burton, remembered the name vaguely
but couldn't put her finger on it. Was she a singer? An actress? A
WNBA player?
</P>
<P>
   The tiny second-grader reminded her mother that in 1960, at age
6, Bridges became the first black child to attend William Frantz
Public School in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   And because she was black, Bridges had to be escorted to school
every day by members of the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into the school, all of the white parents moved
their children out,'' Bridges said. ``They boycotted, and none of
the teachers would teach me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittany felt like she could relate to some of Bridges'
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the only African-American in my class,'' Brittany said.
``I think I could have done what she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges was in Atlanta recently to talk to young people about
what it was like to go to school under those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined by Ernest Green and Elizabeth Eckford. Green and
Eckford participated in the integration of Central High School in
Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   For many students today, it's hard to imagine what Eckford,
Green and Bridges went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to students,'' Eckford said, ``I have to paint a
picture because segregation is so alien to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law that said blacks
and whites could not ride in railroad cars together. It meant that
``separate but equal'' would be acceptable in keeping blacks and
whites apart in housing, jobs and education, too.
</P>
<P>
   But separate wasn't equal; blacks suffered in poor, unequipped
schools. So in 1954, another case, Brown versus Board of Education,
forced the desegregation of public schools. It meant blacks and
whites could go to school together.
</P>
<P>
   But in places like New Orleans and Little Rock, change took
time.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus refused to let black
students in the school, so President Dwight Eisenhower sent in
1,200 federal troops to guard the students.
</P>
<P>
   Eckford, who still lives in Little Rock and is a probation
officer, said the experience was so painful that she refused to
talk about it for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of pain, but I guess I have an obligation
now. If students can talk to older people, it makes what I am
trying to tell them more immediate and real,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Eckford's stories, it is easy to understand why she
refused to talk for so long. Imagine going to school every day and
getting called names by almost everybody. Eckford and Green were
spit on by other students. Eckford was pushed down the stairs once,
and her mother was fired from her job.
</P>
<P>
   At a book signing that featured Eckford, Green and Bridges,
Brittany waited patiently to meet her idol.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she made it to the front of the line. She hugged and
kissed Bridges, then sat in Bridges' lap as her mother took a
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are so overwhelmed by the story, and for me that is an
inspiration,'' Bridges said. ``It tells me there is hope and that
they are interested in things they should be interested in.''

   A generation after it seized power, Iran's revolutionary regime
is deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   It is fractured by intense political divisions, endangered by
economic disorder, discredited by rampant corruption and smothered
in social restrictions no longer acceptable to large sectors of the
changing population.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, the Islamic Republic of Iran often appears
to be at a precipice, its unique theocratic government on the verge
of imploding from internal tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year its domestic drama has played out visibly,
and sometimes violently, in killings by a rogue death squad,
newspaper closures, student unrest, political trials and, as
always, uneasy relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran, often in spite of the theocrats, has begun to achieve
one of the revolution's original goals: empowering the people. For
new social and political movements are blossoming defiantly,
ranging from religious reform and cultural expression to women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   True, the theocratic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, austere form because of
profound internal problems. Yet the driving force behind the
revolution has proven adaptable enough to allow Iranians to get for
themselves what the theocracy has failed to provide. Iran's
increasingly savvy population is taking stands on social issues,
making demands and even defying the theocrats.
</P>
<P>
   _ The First Republic (1979-1989). Iran's revolution was about
more than getting rid of an unpopular leader. After the shah's
ouster, the coterie around Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini gradually
crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy. Human rights were
virtually ignored during the decade-long ``First Republic,'' which
lasted from 1979 until Khomeini's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The regime's zealots became obsessed with deconstructing the
past and winning converts to their cause, both at home and in the
region. The new state survived only by crushing dissent, spending
its foreign exchange reserves and tapping into fierce, age-old
Persian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, seeds of public empowerment were planted and grew.
The ``construction jihad'' _ carried out by teams of development
experts and builders _ brought progress in the form of new schools,
social services, clinics, electricity, television and roads to the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution particularly excelled in education, in quantity
if not always in quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, only half of Iran's youth between the ages of
six and 24 were literate. Two decades later, the number had grown
to 93 percent _ even though the population had doubled. And
students remained in school longer: The number of university
graduates soared from 430,000 in the late 1970s to more than 4
million in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This success spurred people's expectations of a greater role in
the system and access to new instruments of progress.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Second Republic (1989-1997). During President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's tenure, Iran graduated to realistically dealing with
the present. One might say that the government of God plummeted
back to earth _ with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   The new leadership initially promoted physical reconstruction of
the nation, economic reform and a diplomatic thaw. But without the
Ayatollah's authority, longstanding political divisions deepened
and paralysis set in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a brief try at privatization, including reviving the
monarchy's stock market, the promise of change remained largely
unfulfilled. In the end, the regime's blatantly manipulative
tactics kept it from achieving its goals, instead spawning
corruption, deepening debt and social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the very policies that Rafsanjani introduced to
win back the support of a war-weary public inadvertently
jump-started the process of the people's empowerment. The regime
sporadically tolerated cultural freedoms and relaxed some of its
social restrictions. It also facilitated a consumer spending spree
on imports by making credit available.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world soon flooded back in, through satellite
dishes, videos, computers and textbooks full of ideas. From that
point on, the tide of information could no longer be controlled,
regardless how hard Iranian conservatives and clerics tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Republic also overlapped with the end of the Cold
War, which Iranians felt deeply because of their shared border with
the Soviet Union. The collapse of Soviet rule _ in a country with
superpower resources _ sent a powerful warning about the
vulnerability of revolutionary regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iran's upheaval was part of global change, including the
demise of communism in Europe, white rule in Africa and military
dictatorships in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's theocracy came to recognize that it was endangering its
own agenda by ignoring the state's real problems _ for example, its
``population policy.'' In the 1980s, millions of women had obeyed
the theocrats' dictate to breed a new Islamic generation that would
defend the revolution. In seven years Iran's population jumped from
34 million to more than 50 million; it is now 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the clerics soon realized that soaring population numbers
were more likely to undo the revolution than to save it. So they
introduced one of the world's most extensive family-planning
programs. Every form of birth control, from condoms and pills to
sterilization, became free.
</P>
<P>
   Today all couples have to undergo and pass a family-planning
course before obtaining a marriage license. Thousands of women
mobilized by the Health Ministry have gone door-to-door to explain
the necessity of birth control. Clerics, preaching the benefits of
small family size, have issued decrees approving everything from
intrauterine devices to vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Third Republic (1997 to present). In the 1997 presidential
election, which had the highest turnout since the Iranian people
endorsed revolution, 70 percent of Iran's voters spurned the
theocrats' candidate of choice. Instead they elected a dark-horse
cleric named Mohammad Khatami, a former minister of culture and
Islamic guide who was purged in 1992 for ``liberalism'' and
''negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The election marked the burgeoning of what is by now a very
public fight for empowerment. The outcome of the Iranian elections
will at least partly reflect the degree of Khatami's success in
restoring the rule of law, fostering a civil society (two of his
campaign pledges), and wresting power from the religious
superstructure _ the theocratic part of Iran's system _ that limits
the government's powers.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, Iran's future will be decided by the newly
energized popular forces that made Khatami's election possible in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Even clerics who have held high office and intellectuals who
were proteges of the Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   For example, all of Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the
trial of Abdollah Nouri, a cleric and editor of the newspaper
Khordad, who served during the Third Republic as vice president,
interior minister and Tehran city councilor. The Special Court for
the Clergy charged him with multiple counts of ``insulting'' Islam,
the prophet Muhammad and the Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, a close supporter of President Khatami, had run articles
in Khordad that questioned everything from the Islamic concept of
eye-for-eye justice to the clergy's automatic right to hold power.
At his trial, he astonished Iranians by denying the court's right
to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its membership, and its
competence to conduct this trial, and any verdict you reach will
have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison.
His newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly pledged to
launch another publication _ the new way of getting around forced
closures.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and professor
put on trial for ``disseminating lies and disturbing public
opinion'' by advocating the separation of political and religious
institutions, rejected the clergy's right to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being convicted and receiving an 18-month sentence,
Kadivar gained celebrity status. Posters of him were plastered all
over Tehran. Students held a candlelight vigil in the hills near
Evin prison, where he was being held without bail. Chanting
``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released doves as a
symbol of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the world around it, Iran is still undergoing a profound
transformation. More internal turmoil lies ahead, as the
revolution's early passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism,
and as arrogance gives way to realism among many sectors of Iranian
society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians.
</P>
<P>

Iranian women is fast changing, as an energetic ``liberation''
movement is shattering the starkest stereotype of the Islamic

   A generation after the revolution, Iranian women are by far the
most politically active in the Persian Gulf and are among the most
empowered in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 200 women ran for the 270-seat parliament and 14 won.
In 1997, four women registered to run for the presidency. Although
all were disqualified by the Council of Guardians that vets
candidates, the decision was not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's stunning upset victory would not have happened without
the female vote, in this country where women have the franchise
from the age of 15, and he appointed a female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 5,000 women ran in local elections, and 300 won. Today,
more than 40 percent of university students are female, as are
one-third of faculty members. Thousands of women educated after the
revolution work as engineers, doctors, scientists, lawyers and even
clerics. More than 340 directors-general in government ministries
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of
books and magazines published by women only. Women have become
painters, authors, designers, photographers, movie producers,
directors, stars and sculptors crafting ``anatomically correct''
female figures (otherwise known as nudes).
</P>
<P>
   A fierce women's movement was not what the theocrats had
intended to see as characteristic of Iran's Islamic revolution.
Their original goal was more akin to gender apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, the regime, in one way or another,
dismissed almost all women who earlier had risen to positions of
importance. A former female education minister was executed for
promoting ``prostitution'' among girls.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's severe intentions were reflected in the new
Islamic dress code and the lowering _ to age 9 _ of the minimum age
at which women could be married. The new constitution also removed
critical women's rights in divorce and child-custody battles.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, many of the country's restrictions on women
still border on the bizarre:
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman may have an equal vote in parliament or equal powers
among the vice presidents, but her testimony in court carries only
half the weight of a man's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can head universities and publish newspapers but cannot
leave the country without their husbands' written permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can act in plays and movies alongside men, but they
cannot sing in public or ride in the same section of a public bus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iranian women have proven irrepressible. In
defiance of the theocracy, they are putting their imprints on
diverse aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1990s, pressure from women changed laws on
employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women packed a courtroom
to protest child-custody laws after the brutal death of an
eight-year-old girl. She had weighed only 35 pounds and suffered a
fractured skull, two broken arms and burn marks over her body at
the hands of her father, a drug addict with a criminal record and a
documented history of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic tradition allows a mother to keep a daughter until the
age of seven and a son until the age of two; full custody then
switches to the father. In 1998 Parliament revised the law to
stipulate that a child could no longer be awarded to an unfit
father, defining the custody qualifications in a way that could
often disqualify men.
</P>
<P>
   Women have challenged other male bastions as well. Thousands of
women broke a long-time barrier preventing females from attending
male sporting events when they poured into Tehran's stadium to
greet the Iranian soccer team after it qualified for the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also playing sports. Tehran alone has 85 women's
basketball teams in five leagues. Only 10,000 women engaged in
intramural sports on the eve of the revolution. Today, 2 million
participate in soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis, handball,
skiing, aerobics, fencing, judo, shooting, volleyball, rowing,
horseback riding, gymnastics, golf, table tennis, karate, tae kwon
do and even water-skiing. This, despite the slightly absurd
waterproof coats and scarves women must wear to demonstrate
``modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   And women have forced the theocrats to acknowledge their
official participation. At the 1996 Olympics, for the first time, a
female athlete led the Iranian team onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The new activists are as distinct as their political
environment. The most outspoken women are no longer necessarily
Westernized or upper-class elites, but have emerged from within the
revolution. Many are from traditional families, clerical circles
and rural areas _ none of which had previously produced female
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Women's publications have been brazen on reform issues. ``Zan''
(Woman) _ which the theocrats banned in 1999 _ was a newspaper
published by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Rafsanjani, and a member of parliament. It editorialized against
child-custody laws, the use of stoning as a punishment, and
``temporary marriage'' _ the practice of contracting a short-term
wife. It ran an expose on the return of prostitution and reported
on a New Year's message sent to the country by the former empress
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Another publication, ``Farzaneh,'' is trying to reconcile more
robust women's rights with the Islamic faith. Its articles have
included ``Human Rights of Women in Islam,'' ``A History of Silence
and Debates Today,'' ``How to Proceed'' and ``The Long Way Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema, which often focuses on women, has led a major
countercultural revolution since the early 1990s. We find female
movie characters who are challenging the status quo, plots that
focus on the shortcomings of the Islamic system and dialogue that
extends the boundaries of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Dariush Mehrjui, the father of modern Iranian cinema, wrote a
quartet of films _ ``Banoo'' (1992), ``Sara'' (1993), ``Pari''
(1995) and ``Leila'' (1997) _ about the professional and personal
plight of women in Islamic society. Each ended with the lead female
character defying convention or leaving her husband to head out on
her own _ a radical move in a society where women must get written
permission to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who spent five years in the shah's jails, was
known in the 1980s for ardently religious and pro-revolution films.
But his seventh film, ``A Time to Love,'' was a controversial tale
_ with three endings based on three perspectives _ about a married
woman who pursues a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Makhmalbaf's teen-age daughter Samira made her film
debut with ``The Apple,'' the true story of an illiterate man who
had locked his 12-year-old twin daughters at home since infancy,
for fear that the girls' purity would be spoiled by strange men's
gazes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie revolved around the gradual exposure of the girls _
almost mute, unschooled and both physically and mentally disabled _
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the film to make this point: All it takes to imprison
many, many women is one man,'' Samira told reporters when the film
opened in New York in 1999. ``What I noticed about those two girls
is that the more they came into contact with society, the more
complete they became as human beings. For me, that became a
metaphor for all women. Women in Iran are like springs. If they
want to be free, and if they try, they burst out with a lot of
energy.''

   A generation after the revolution, Iranian women are by far the
most politically active in the Persian Gulf and are among the most
empowered in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 200 women ran for the 270-seat parliament and 14 won.
In 1997, four women registered to run for the presidency. Although
all were disqualified by the Council of Guardians that vets
candidates, the decision was not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's stunning upset victory would not have happened without
the female vote, in this country where women have the franchise
from the age of 15, and he appointed a female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 5,000 women ran in local elections, and 300 won. Today,
more than 40 percent of university students are female, as are
one-third of faculty members. Thousands of women educated after the
revolution work as engineers, doctors, scientists, lawyers and even
clerics. More than 340 directors-general in government ministries
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of
books and magazines published by women only. Women have become
painters, authors, designers, photographers, movie producers,
directors, stars and sculptors crafting ``anatomically correct''
female figures (otherwise known as nudes).

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pow. Take that, you loony liberal fraud. Pow right
back. Take that, you phony religious panderer.
</P>
<P>
   And so the name-calling goes in the unseemly GOP primary fight
between Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain in South Carolina,
currently one of the bloodiest Southern political battlefields
since the Civil War. If politics is a game in which the players are
supposed to make voters like them, someone threw away the rule book
here.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing likable about the way Bush and McCain are
behaving. Mutually frantic, they are mutually out to kick each
other's backside even if they have to fib to do so. There is not
even much pretence that they are above the fray while their allies
do the dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   I paraphrase some transparent bobbing and weaving:
</P>
<P>
   Bush: What? A veteran standing by my side accused McCain of
ignoring veterans? I know nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Phone bank callers are claiming McCain is a phony, a liar and a
hypocrite? That can't be from my operation. It must be from Alan
Keyes'. It's ridiculous. I'd fire the culprits if I could find
them.
</P>
<P>
   When I appeared at Bob Jones University, I was merely talking to
the students, not endorsing the school history of segregation or
its policy of forbidding interracial dating. It's unfair to ascribe
some doctrine to me just because I try to attract votes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain: What? A publisher who supports me prints segregationist
material? I know nothing about it. I'm not a racist.
</P>
<P>
   My advisers are saying Bush is daddy's boy and are comparing his
National Guard uniform to my own heroic conduct in Vietnam? Never
heard that before, and I don't flaunt my military background.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to call me a waffler just because I've changed my
mind lately and now oppose the most extreme aspects of
anti-abortionism and of protecting the tobacco industry. I'm still
a conservative. I'm just not an ideological nut.
</P>
<P>
   There are laughable lines in this fakery, but it is not fun.
This is brutal politics _ hand-to-hand combat not just over a
primary victory but over the very heart and soul of the Republican
Party. If McCain wins the GOP presidential nomination, he may well
free the party of the stranglehold of the religious right, the
dominance of the old Reagan-era establishment and the blind
ideological devotion to tax cuts in the face of all reason.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush has been moving ever rightward, consolidating
his support in the Christian right and the standard hard-core GOP
conservative base to counter McCain's popularity with independents
and moderates. Bush is unmistakably the party's establishment
candidate, no matter how hard he tries to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much difference between the two men on major
national issues, but a canyon yawns when it comes to attitude,
image and openness to change.
</P>
<P>
   So they have been tearing at each other's throats rather than
using those vocal chords to debate presidential priorities.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was correct to kill one of his commercials that described
Bush as just as politically slippery as President Clinton. It was
so harsh that it was backfiring, undercutting McCain's image as a
good guy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, plans to go ahead this week with equally harsh
ads that paint McCain as a double-talking fake who promotes
campaign finance reform but takes big bucks from Washington
lobbyists. This is unfair, since Bush has raised many times more
than McCain has from those same lobbyists. This message may also
backfire since the thrust is that it is okay for an establishment
darling who can dominate the system but not okay for a competitor
who dares to think about eventually shaking it up.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also calls McCain a certifiable liberal, a political
pejorative that his father used to devastating effect against his
own 1988 challenger, Democrat Michael Dukakis. The current charge
is a total distortion of McCain's congressional record, as Bush
knows. McCain is a rock-ribbed conservative, except where he has
chosen to disagree with his party's orthodoxy on selected issues
like campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush strategy is to steal McCain's image by claiming to be
the real outsider and the real reformer, but it won't work. The
outsider claim is patently silly for the son of a president who has
the endorsement of most GOP governors and members of Congress and
who has raised so much campaign money that he refused to take
public funds. The reformer pose doesn't stand up either because
Bush talks only about his so-called ``reforms'' in Texas and he
doesn't have any great plans to transform the federal government
should he be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also trying on the openness mantle, talking more freely
to audiences and to the media. But his concept of informality is
rolling an orange down the aisle of the campaign plane, a gesture
Nancy Reagan used to make when things were tense between the White
House and the media. Rather inadequate, that.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for his part, abandoning the attack ads, is now back to
reinforcing his own identity as an outspoken free-thinker who will
rid the Republican Party of its most outrageous baggage and
revitalize the political system. Nobody has to urge, ``Let McCain
be McCain.'' He is who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Bush contends that Democrats have a plot to vote for McCain in
South Carolina on Saturday and then go back to their own party in
the general election, having destroyed his candidacy. Nonsense. Any
sensible Democrat who wants the party to win the White House
suspects that Gore would do better running against Bush, a
traditional Republican, than the magical McCain.

&HT;     UNANSWERED QUESTIONS FOR THE 2000 GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN SHEA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new era of Giants baseball is here, an era in
which the Giants aren't even the top draw in their own ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The park itself is the real draw, judging by the phenomenon that
the entire 2000 season will probably sell out by Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   As Terence Mann told Ray Kinsella on an Iowa cornfield, ``People
will come, Ray. People will most definitely come.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance _ 3 million is a cinch _ is no longer based primarily
on how the Giants fare on the field, but how swell the Bay looks
from those charter seats. The trick is to convince everyone that
the home team is worth watching, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finished second the past two seasons and anticipate
Pacific Bell Park will help accelerate their quest to win the
National League West. But some weighty questions need to be
answered first. Here are five:
</P>
<P>
   _ Can the Giants win despite a lack of winter moves? Ask that
question enough times, and you're liable to get bonked on the head
by the people responsible for the lack of winter moves.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Brian Sabean, with a nudge from ownership,
insists there was little reason for major roster reshuffling
because the core players already were signed through 2000. They had
hoped for better luck finding a catcher and third baseman but
seemed satisfied with the late signing of Russ Davis, who'll
challenge Bill Mueller at third.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and catcher Bobby Estalella are the only newcomers while
the list of departed players is long _ Julian Tavarez, Jerry
Spradlin, Chris Brock, Rich Rodriguez, Brent Mayne, Scott Servais,
F.P. Santangelo and Charlie Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, management insists it's an improvement over the
club that entered spring training last year, largely because Livan
Hernandez and Joe Nathan have arrived and Russ Ortiz became an
established winner.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the Giants argue, what moves have the first-place
Diamondbacks made?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Robb Nen throw 100 mph again? Will it matter? Possibly
not.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you believe the company line, that Nen will become a
more complete pitcher this season, that decreased velocity caused
by his worn-and-torn elbow will prompt him to improve his control
and hit the corners rather than simply firing heaters down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   The truth will come soon enough, perhaps the first week of the
season when Nen is summoned to save a one-run lead in the ninth
with Chipper Jones, Brian Jordan and Andrew Jones coming up.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, it'll come later in the year after Nen has had a
chance to develop his new approach. For the record, he has an ``all
is well'' attitude, but it's no secret management is genuinely
concerned about the fragile closer who posted career highs in blown
saves (nine) and losses (eight) and his highest ERA (3.98) since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nen will have extra incentive to bounce back from surgery
because he's due to be a free agent next winter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who in the name of Dennis Littlejohn will catch? Kirt
Manwaring, anybody?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants seem to need somebody, anybody, so long as he's
experienced, even if he's just a warm body. They say they're
confident with Doug Mirabelli and Estalella, but those guys have
played a combined 134 games.
</P>
<P>
   They lost Mayne and Service, both to Colorado, and failed to
lure veteran Joe Girardi, who signed with the Cubs. The remaining
free agents are past-their-primers Benito Santiago and Manwaring,
neither considered a great mentor.
</P>
<P>
   There's still time to make a deal, if only to provide leadership
and teach Mirabelli and Estalella about big-league do's and don'ts.
Of course, Mirabelli and Estalella could end such talk by proving
themselves in spring training, by handling a promising rotation and
generating a base hit now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabelli is potentially a dynamic defender and Estalella has a
history of hitting home runs in bunches. But ponder this: How many
teams have won championships with a couple of pledges behind the
plate?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is the rotation young and talented or just young? There are
reasons to believe talent accompanies the youth, from 1 to 5.
Outgoing pitching coach Ron Perranoski predicted this rotation will
be the league's best, if and when the Braves' guys ever slow down.
</P>
<P>
   That puts pressure on new pitching coach Dave Righetti, but the
young chaps are the reason Righetti said he took the job in the
first place. He wants to be there when they peak.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be this year? There are two sides to every story.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (the Opening Day starter) broke into the majors 9-0
and was the 1997 World Series MVP, but he's 18-24 since then.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz won 18 games in his first full season, but he led the
league in walks.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Rueter has the second-highest winning percentage among
lefties in the last 20 years, but he rarely goes deep into games.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan shined in his first tour of duty, but he's untested over
a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Estes was a 19-game winner three years ago, but what have
you done for me lately? The club was relieved that, for the first
time in recent memory, it didn't need to acquire a veteran starter
in the offseason. Long gone are the days of Danny Darwin, Orel
Hershiser and Mark Gardner (all born in the black-and-white TV
era), though Gardner remains on call as the No. 6 starter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hershiser would still be in the mix if he hadn't
decided to play closer to his Florida home and sign in ... Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's up with His Barryness? Once the richest man in
baseball, Barry Bonds has become an afterthought now that $100
million is the magic number. He's no longer on the top-10 salary
list, though he's not exactly living in the streets, given he'll
make $10.7 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   And his game isn't burnt toast, either. In fact, the ingredients
are in place for a monster season. For starters, he'd like to play
his usual 155 to 160 games after missing two months in 1999
following elbow surgery. Also, he wants to make a splash,
literally, at the new park, where his home runs could land in the
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Junior factor. Ken Griffey Jr. did what
Bonds did in 1993, leave his long-time team to play for his
home-town team. Bonds was an MVP his first season with the Giants,
and Griffey seeks similar fortunes in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, who battled Griffey for player-of-the-'90s honors, has a
ton of pride and watched from the disabled list as Griffey hit
another 48 homers last year. Now that they're in the same league,
Bonds wouldn't mind teaching Griffey, who's five years younger, a
little something about NL ball.

   If past performance is any measure, there is no doubt that in
Senator Hillary Clinton, the people of New York would have a tough,
feisty and intelligent woman standing up for their interests. That
Hillary, though, must have slipped out of the back door of her new
home in Chappaqua, N.Y. The woman who stood in her raincoat and
sensible shoes by the front gate on moving day was but a

HORMONE REGIMEN RAISES CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than three weeks after one major study found a greater
increase in the risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women
taking both estrogen and progestin than among those taking estrogen
alone, another major study, being published Wednesday, has come to
similar, troubling conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the new studies could dramatically change the
way women take hormone supplements to combat hot flashes and lower
the risks of heart disease and osteoporosis in later life.
</P>
<P>
   For years, doctors have known that taking estrogen without
progestin, a second hormone, can raise the risk of endometrial
cancer, or cancer of the uterus, eight-fold. That's why both
hormones are usually prescribed together.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study, being published in the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute, along with the one published in January
in the Journal of the American Medical Association, show that
``evidence is mounting that combined estrogen and progestin may be
more deleterious in terms of breast cancer than estrogen alone,''
said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And what about uterine cancer risk? Some experts say that
progestin may be able to be given in limited doses, perhaps a few
times a year, to lower the risk of endometrial cancer, but this has
not been proven.
</P>
<P>
   This week's study, led by Dr. Ronald K. Ross and Malcolm Pike
and others at the University of Southern California, looked at
1,897 postmenopausal women with breast cancer and 1,637 similar
women who did not have the disease and compared their use of
postmenopausal hormones.
</P>
<P>
   They found that for every five years a woman takes estrogen
alone, the risk of breast cancer increases about six percent. But
for every five years a woman takes both estrogen and progestin _
known as combined therapy _ the risk of breast cancer rises 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are different ways to take the combined therapy _ a woman
can take both hormones every day, or sequentially, that is,
estrogen every day and progestin only part of the month. The
researchers found that the risk of breast cancer was higher in
women who used the sequential therapy than among those who took
both hormones every day: it rose 38 percent for every five years of
sequential hormone use versus 9 percent for every five years of
``combined continuous'' use. These differences suggest that
combined, continuous use may be safer than sequential use, but the
differences did not reach statistical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The data from the new study suggest that ``the overall
risk-benefit equation will be considerably less favorable (for
combined therapy) than for ERT (estrogen replacement therapy)
alone,'' the authors write. ``If the main purpose for prescribing
(combined therapy) is to protect the endometrium from the
carcinogenic effects of estrogen, then this study would argue that
the adverse effect on the breast may outweigh the beneficial effect
on the endometrium . . .''
</P>
<P>
   This study is the largest so far to look at estrogen and
progestin risks for breast cancer and contains more data than ``the
combined world literature on this subject,'' the authors noted in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Pike, a co-author and renowned researcher into the
hormonal mechanisms underlying breast cancer, said Monday that he
predicted a dozen years ago that adding progestin to estrogen
therapy would be dangerous in terms of breast cancer. ``This is not
out of the blue,'' he said. While progestin stops cell
proliferation _ the underlying mechanism of cancer _ in the uterus,
it can drive it in the breast.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging data suggest it is now time, he said, to abandon
combined hormone replacement therapy, at least as it's now done.
But since the uterus still needs protection from ``unopposed
estrogen'' (estrogen taken alone), he suggests giving women
progestin three to four times a year to trigger bleeding, which
could help the uterus shed precancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be possible to give progestin as vaginal
suppositories to achieve the same effect, he said, or to make
special progestin-containing IUDs (intra-uterine devices) for
postmenopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   These measures, however, have not been proven beneficial, notes
Manson of Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But the data do mean ``we should rethink our use'' of hormone
replacement therapy, she said. ``I have noticed in my own practice
that I have less enthusiasm for hormone replacement therapy, though
some women still are good candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Manson noted there is conclusive evidence that estrogen
does help prevent osteoporosis, and that adding progestin neither
provides additional protection nor takes away from estrogen's
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cholesterol, it is also clear that estrogen alone is
better than estrogen plus progestin, she says. Estrogen alone
lowers LDL or ``bad'' cholesterol and also increases HDL or
``good'' cholesterol. Combined hormone therapy is just as good at
lowering bad cholesterol but does not increase the good form.
</P>
<P>
   For heart disease, she adds, ``the jury is still out.'' For
women who have never had a heart attack, combined hormone therapy
seem to be just as good as estrogen alone at protecting against
heart disease; but for women who have already had one heart attack,
combined hormone therapy does not reduce the risk of subsequent
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   For Alzheimer's disease, there are strong theoretical reasons to
think that either estrogen alone or in combination with progestin
may reduce the risk. But so far, there is no conclusive evidence on
this from clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   So, should women currently taking both estrogen and progestin
stop taking the latter?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' says Dr. Nananda Col, director of the Women's
Wellness Center at the New England Medical Center. ``If you take
estrogen without progestin, the risk of endometrial cancer
increases eight-fold. That is a whopping difference.. . .
Endometrial cancer is not a cancer to be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, she says, the new study, like the one in January,
has a number of flaws that make it far from definitive. Among other
things, she says, the apparent increase in breast cancer risk among
women on combination therapy may have occurred because they were
taking higher doses of estrogen, not simply because of the
progestin. ``We haven't disentangled that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maureen Connelly, an epidemiologist and codirector of the
menopause consultation service at Harvard Vanguard Medical
Associates, takes a similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should rethink'' their hormone decisions, ``but they
should be cautioned against automatically throwing their progestin
in the trash and continuing with estrogen alone. We know absolutely
that that will increase the risk of endometrial cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Manson adds a final word of advice. Even with all the
emerging data, she says, it still appears that short-term use of
hormones at menopause does not appear to raise breast cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women just take hormones for three years. So the good
news is we can be reassuring for those women. . .the key is to
minimize duration of use and total dose of these hormones.''

BOBBY LABONTE APPEARS READY FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ With the 2000 NASCAR season opening with
Sunday's Daytona 500, a huge year could be ahead for Bobby Labonte
and a much-improved one for his older brother Terry.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1999, about the only competition Bobby Labonte and
rookie Tony Stewart had was each other. The two Pontiac drivers who
are teammates at Joe Gibbs Racing dominated the final 10 races of
the year, with Bobby Labonte especially impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 10 events, Labonte won once and finished in the top
three eight times. Stewart won three times and was second in two
other races. So, going into 2000, many feel this is the team to
beat for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, second to Dale Jarrett in last year's championship
chase, had a characteristically low-key comment about the season
ahead. ``We've got everybody back in place like we need to,''
Labonte said. ``The team is really excited about starting the year
off and so am I. That doesn't always count for everything, but at
the same time, we're coming off a great season and looking forward
to beginning this year and not letting up any.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, more intense than Labonte and a driver with his feet
solidly on the ground when they're not pumping pedals in a race
car, is more pragmatic. ``We don't worry about it,'' Stewart said.
``I worry about getting in the car and doing my job. That's for the
media to speculate on and get into the `what if' syndrome. My job
is just to get in the car and drive,'' Stewart said. ``As long as
we keep our focus where it was at the end of last year _ what we
were doing at the end of last year was working for us. So it's one
of those deals, if it's not broke, don't try to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   They may both have a leg up on the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three cars which compete in Winston Cup, Chevy, Ford and
Pontiac, only Pontiac is coming back with the same body style.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, that means Labonte and Stewart's teams have a
base to build on. The minus is that they might not be able to get
the car much better, which could be a problem if the new Chevy
Monte Carlo or redesigned Ford Taurus makes big gains.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the pick here to win the 2000 Winston Cup
championship is Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte and crew chief Jimmy Makar are among the sport's best at
their respective jobs, and NASCAR will make sure that no one car
make, Chevy, Ford or Pontiac, has a decided edge on the track.
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, this team is positioned to win. It came
close last year and knows what it has to do. It has outstanding
direction at the top in Gibbs, a proven winner, and he will see
that his teams have everything they need to be competitive, and
Labonte and Makar will make sure they get the most out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Top Contenders
</P>
<P>
   2. JEFF GORDON, Chevy: People are writing this guy off much too
quickldon's team has undergone major changes and he has
assumed more of a leadership role, but he was far more competitive
last year than the point standings show and he will fall off very
little, if any.
</P>
<P>
   3. MARK MARTIN, Ford: Over the last three years, three drivers
have set themselves apart from the rest, Gordon, Martin and Dale
Jarrett. Extremely steady and healthy for the first time in a long
time, Martin has an excellent chance of winning it all.
</P>
<P>
   4. DALE JARRETT, Ford: The defending champion, it all went right
for this team a year ago but that wasn't luck, that was dedication
and hard work and with a crew led by Todd Parrott, Jarrett will be
tough to knock off. The fire's still there.
</P>
<P>
   The Longshots
</P>
<P>
   5. JEFF BURTON, Ford: Watch out. Over the last three years, this
guy has made marked and steady improvement. He had his best season
in 1999 and is on the verge of championship contention. He could
break through this season.
</P>
<P>
   6. TONY STEWART, Pontiac: Some already believe that Stewart is
the most talented driver in NASCAR, and that is after only one
year. He is with a championship quality team but even more
importantly, he is the best in the business at assessing his
strengths and limitations, and he does not have many limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Best of the Rest
</P>
<P>
   7. DALE EARNHARDT. Chevy: Still very tough, but too far behind
the leaders to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   8. TERRY LABONTE, Chevy: Has crew chief Gary DeHart back, which
will bring him back.
</P>
<P>
   9. RUSTY WALLACE, Ford: See Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   10. MIKE SKINNER, Chevy: Has shown improvement, but many think
he has about peaked.
</P>
<P>
   So let the racing begin.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Stewart's ready. ``I'm tired of talking about it, to
be honest,'' Stewart said. Everybody wants to talk about it. Let's
quit talking about it and let's just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

 &HT;    Activist on suicide-prevention crusade
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kay Redfield Jamison spent more than 20 years researching and
writing about mental illness and suicide with scholarly detachment.
That changed with the 1995 publication of ``An Unquiet Mind: A
Memoir of Moods and Madness,'' a personal account of her own battle
with manic-depressive illness and her suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Since the book became a best seller, Jamison, a professor of
psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, has been one
of the nation's most passionate advocates of suicide prevention and
access to mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 17 minutes, an American commits suicide,'' she told a
U.S. Senate hearing last week. ``Where's the public outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   Cox writer John Head spoke with her by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People are commonly told to take it seriously whenever
someone they know talks of wanting to commit suicide. Is there a
way to know when our own thoughts of suicide should be taken
seriously?
</P>
<P>
   A: Thoughts of suicide should always be taken seriously. If
someone is concerned about it, they certainly should see somebody _
see a doctor, see a psychologist, a psychiatrist or an internist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, is it common?
</P>
<P>
   A: Thinking about suicide is not that uncommon. Maybe 15 percent
of people will think about suicide at one point or another in their
lives. But it's still something that, if it continues, it's
certainly something to be concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher has focused on what he
calls the nation's suicide epidemic, and he's said he wants to make
suicide prevention one of his priorities. What impact do you see
from his doing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's been terrific. ... He has made the public health
community much more aware of how common suicide is. He has added
the respect of both his office and himself, which are considerable.
And he has put together a report, which is the first report from
his office on suicide as a major issue for the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: More than 30,000 people commit suicide in the United States
every year. It's the third leading cause of death among those 15 to
24 years old, and the rate among teenagers has quadrupled in the
last 45 years. Given those numbers, do you think the government
response to the problem to this point has been adequate?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Not at all. Until very recently, the government has not
really paid a great deal of attention to it. ... It's changing, but
to date I don't think there's been enough money invested in
scientific research. I don't think there's been enough money or
public proclamation about how devastating it is, because it's a
particularly devastating kind of death.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Some people might argue that suicide is such an intimate,
individual act that the government can really have very little
effect on it.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't agree with that for a moment. It's an intimate act in
that, of course, it's an individual who kills himself or herself.
And, of course, there are a lot of individual feelings and
experiences that go into it. But we know a lot about suicide, and
we know a lot about how to prevent suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Q:W hat sort of actions would you like to see?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would like to see a lot more public discussion of it _ a
lot more discussion of it in churches and in universities and in
communities. I would like to see much more focus on depression and
the recognition and treatment of depression.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Getting back to the surgeon general, he has been particularly
concerned about the increased rate of suicide among
African-Americans, a group that historically has recorded lower
rates. Do you have any theories about this increase, especially
among young African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several theories out there.
</P>
<P>
   One is that access to alcohol, drugs, firearms _ the same things
that make suicide more likely in young white men _ are now making
it much more likely in young African-American men. (Another
explanation may be) a lack of access to good medical and
psychiatric care (in black communities).

 &HT;    Activist on suicide-prevention crusade
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kay Redfield Jamison spent more than 20 years researching and
writing about mental illness and suicide with scholarly detachment.
That changed with the 1995 publication of ``An Unquiet Mind: A
Memoir of Moods and Madness,'' a personal account of her own battle
with manic-depressive illness and her suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Since the book became a best seller, Jamison, a professor of
psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, has been one
of the nation's most passionate advocates of suicide prevention and
access to mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 17 minutes, an American commits suicide,'' she told a
U.S. Senate hearing last week. ``Where's the public outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   Cox writer John Head spoke with her by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People are commonly told to take it seriously whenever
someone they know talks of wanting to commit suicide. Is there a
way to know when our own thoughts of suicide should be taken
seriously?
</P>
<P>
   A: Thoughts of suicide should always be taken seriously. If
someone is concerned about it, they certainly should see somebody _
see a doctor, see a psychologist, a psychiatrist or an internist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, is it common?
</P>
<P>
   A: Thinking about suicide is not that uncommon. Maybe 15 percent
of people will think about suicide at one point or another in their
lives. But it's still something that, if it continues, it's
certainly something to be concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher has focused on what he
calls the nation's suicide epidemic, and he's said he wants to make
suicide prevention one of his priorities. What impact do you see
from his doing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's been terrific. ... He has made the public health
community much more aware of how common suicide is. He has added
the respect of both his office and himself, which are considerable.
And he has put together a report, which is the first report from
his office on suicide as a major issue for the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: More than 30,000 people commit suicide in the United States
every year. It's the third leading cause of death among those 15 to
24 years old, and the rate among teenagers has quadrupled in the
last 45 years. Given those numbers, do you think the government
response to the problem to this point has been adequate?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Not at all. Until very recently, the government has not
really paid a great deal of attention to it. ... It's changing, but
to date I don't think there's been enough money invested in
scientific research. I don't think there's been enough money or
public proclamation about how devastating it is, because it's a
particularly devastating kind of death.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Some people might argue that suicide is such an intimate,
individual act that the government can really have very little
effect on it.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't agree with that for a moment. It's an intimate act in
that, of course, it's an individual who kills himself or herself.
And, of course, there are a lot of individual feelings and
experiences that go into it. But we know a lot about suicide, and
we know a lot about how to prevent suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Q:W hat sort of actions would you like to see?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would like to see a lot more public discussion of it _ a
lot more discussion of it in churches and in universities and in
communities. I would like to see much more focus on depression and
the recognition and treatment of depression.

FULL FUNDING FOR RICKY RAY TRUST DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CATHERINE HOLLINGSWORTH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite White House assurances that it would seek
full funding of a program to compensate hemophiliacs infected with
HIV, President Clinton's new budget leaves the Ricky Ray trust far
short of the necessary $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who wrote the legislation creating the
fund, blamed the White House for dashing hopes in the hemophilia
community. The president's budget would only partially fund the
program at $100 million a year for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed and I frankly think the White House
let those folks down,'' Goss said. ``There's no reason in the world
we can't get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund as named for the Florida teen whose death from AIDS led
to a national crusade on behalf of hemophiliacs who were
unknowingly infected with HIV through contaminated blood in the
1980s. The compensation program was launched under a law signed by
Clinton in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When initial funding for the program was in doubt last year,
Ricky's mother, Louise Ray, and others pressed the White House to
come up with the money based on Clinton's longstanding support of
their efforts. John Podesta, White House Chief of Staff personally
pledged the administration would eventually provide the requested
amount.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's appropriation came in at $75 million, the
hemophiliac advocates again met with Podesta and received further
encouragement that the full amount would be sought. A White House
official confirmed Podesta's conversation with Ray and two other
activists.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself in January wrote to a hemophilia advocacy
group about last year's appropriation, saying, ``while I recognize
that this does not fully fund your requested amount, I believe it
serves as a significant down payment on the full funding amount.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goss said the president was doing ``a lot of talk.'`
</P>
<P>
   Louise Ray, who flew to Washington from her home in Sarasota to
meet with Podesta in January, was not overly critical of the
administration, saying she did not want to appear ungrateful for
what the president has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we expected but it's another step forward,'' she
said of the new budget request. ``I really would have liked to get
the full $750 million, but government doesn't always work that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray has led a 17-year battle to get the federal government to
acknowledge it caused an estimated 20,000 individuals to contract
the AIDS virus through tainted donated blood.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is crucial that victims are compensated as quickly
as possible, since AIDS-stricken hemophiliacs are dying at a rate
of one person a day. Many want the money to pay medical bills and
other expenses before they die.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20,000 who are believed to have been infected with HIV,
only about half are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To drag out these payments seems to be a little cruel when
there are people dying,'' Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hemophilia Foundation was clearly disappointed with
the incremental funding in the president's budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were obviously hoping for full funding,'' said Patrick
Collins, director of government affairs at the foundation. ``It's
unfortunate. It's looking like a drawn-out process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Kuhn, legislator director of the Committee of Ten Thousand
_ a group representing the nearly 10,000 hemophilia victims still
alive _ and committee president Corey Dubin were present at the
Jan. 30 White House meeting with Ray and Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta told them full funding became complicated when Congress
housed the money in the Health and Human Services Department rather
than in the Justice Department, where such claims are typically
handled.
</P>
<P>
   The White House source confirmed the current funding structure
is tying up the money.
</P>
<P>
   But Goss called that explanation ``gobbledygook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy a bit of that,'' he added. ``To say they've been
detoured or derailed by the process, that's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional critics said the president could have found
the money, given the large amounts of new spending in his budget
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The agency responsible for administering the funds, the Health
Resources and Services Administration, is also taking heat because
it could take at least seven months to get the program off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The committee says that is too long. ``This is torture,'' Dubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Morford, deputy administrator at the Health and Resources
Services Administration, said it was working to get checks in the
mail as soon as possible, but must abide by the federal process to
ensure the program runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything humanly possible to be expeditious
within the confines of the law and regulations,'' Morford said.

TURKISH ARMY ACCUSED OF GIVING ARMS TO TERROR GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A growing scandal stemming from a crackdown
on a religious terror group has led to accusations that the group
may have received weapons from the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of raids that began last month, the police have
found 56 gruesomely tortured bodies buried at hideouts used by the
group, called Hizbullah. There was another raid Monday in the
eastern provincial capital of Van, resulting in a shootout in which
five police officers and two suspected Hizbullah militants were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the first bodies were discovered, several leading
politicians and news commentators charged that Hizbullah had worked
with the military in its war against rebels among the Kurdish
ethnic group in eastern Turkey. Military commanders denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence has emerged in recent days suggesting that
Hizbullah used weapons that were imported by the governor of a
province in the heart of the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there are weapons missing, they could have ended up
anywhere,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said. ``This is an
extremely serious situation, and it is being investigated with the
seriousness it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil service investigators said the man who was governor of the
mostly Kurdish province of Batman in the mid-1990s, Salih Sarman,
might be charged with ``establishing an armed unit without
permission.'' Governors in Turkey are appointed by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports, a cache of weapons _ including at
least 443 automatic rifles, 115 rockets and 1,450 hand grenades _
that was sent to Batman by the Turkish government is missing.
Newspapers have reported that many of those weapons were given to
Hizbullah.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, Hizbullah militants were believed to have
killed many suspected members of the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party,
known as the PKK, the initials of its name in Kurdish. The
government was then involved in a no-holds-barred war against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have denied that they gave weapons to
Hizbullah. ``The Turkish armed forces have never had a relationship
with any terrorist organization and will never have such a
relationship,'' Gen. Atila Isik asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of suspected political killings were committed in
Kurdish provinces during the war. In Batman province alone, there
were at least 363 such ``mystery killings,'' none of which have
been solved. Another 43 people are listed as missing.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have charged that Tansu Ciller, who was Turkey's
prime minister in 1995 and 1996, authorized local officials in the
Kurdish region to distribute weapons to terror groups that opposed
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ciller has admitted that she ordered weapons delivered to the
Batman governor, which was an unusual step, since weapons are
normally sent only to military units. She said that her order had
been approved by the military chief of staff and senior police
officials, and that she was ``glad today that we took those actions
then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We met and made a decision,'' Ciller said. ``We agreed that
terror was the top issue, and that we had to do whatever was
necessary. It was not possible to act otherwise. We had to do
everything possible, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel said military commanders had assured
him that all weapons in Batman could be accounted for. But he said
that some of the weapons might have been given to paramilitary
village guards, and that ``from there they may have found their way
to other places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is not always obliged to follow routine,'' Demirel
said. ``It can deviate from routine when higher interests require
it, if the government approves.''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements provoked strong protests from several
politicians. One of them, Salih Yildirim, a prominent member of
Parliament, said: ``The Constitution specifies what the state may
and may not do. Anyone who acts outside these limits is committing
a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired general, Nevzat Bolugiray, told an Istanbul magazine
he believed that Hizbullah might have received government weapons,
but that the transfer had not been approved by military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who see themselves as patriots formed what amounts
to a terrorist group,'' Bolugiray said. ``I believe there may have
been government officials who used Hizbullah against the PKK. This
creates the appearance that it was official state policy, but in my
opinion it was actually an action taken by certain individuals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reports of how the government fought Kurdish rebels in Batman
have led to a series of revelations about actions taken in other
Kurdish provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have reported that in 1994 the governor of Van, a
province where rebels were also active, approved formation of a
secret unit made up of 18 Kurdish-speaking soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers posed as rebels, apparently seeking to find out
which families or villages would sympathize with them. They also
harassed local peasants, demanding money, weapons and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's roughness was apparently too persuasive. It was
ambushed outside the village of Diyadin by a squad of village
guards loyal to the government. Eight of its members were killed
and another nine were wounded.

FAILED TAKEOVER BID CALLED SUCCESS BY JAPANESE STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A deal described as Japan's first indigenous hostile
takeover attempt ended in what Americans would call a failure on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But here, the effort by Yoshiaki Murakami, a former bureaucrat
who had made a bid to take over Shoei Co., a little-known real
estate and electronic parts company, is seen as the most striking
effort to challenge longstanding practices in corporate Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami's bid, to buy Shoei's shares for 1,000 yen, or about
$9.17, apiece, expired Monday. He increased his stake to 6.52
percent from 2.78 percent, far less than needed to veto even the
most basic of management decisions, but he said he considered it a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very happy,'' Murakami said in an interview Monday
evening. ``I created a debate about shareholder value and
management's responsibility for creating shareholder value, and
that was what I wanted to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition fund established by Murakami, a 40-year-old
former official of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, has been widely followed by investors as a barometer of
corporate Japan's willingness to change. His effort to acquire a
controlling stake in Shoei is considered the first instance of a
Japanese investor's having tried a hostile takeover of a Japanese
company.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of his bid raises questions about the prognosis for
another unsolicited takeover effort under way in Japan, a tender
offer by Boehringer Ingelheim, a German drug manufacturer, for a
controlling stake in SS Pharmaceuticals, which is set to expire
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami's bid for Shoei exposed the impediments that Japan's
system of cross-shareholding among banks and corporations pose for
investors. Shoei is a member company of Fuyo Group, a cluster of
companies, or keiretsu, that orbit around Fuji Bank and its related
financial institutions, which together control 60 percent of
Shoei's shares.
</P>
<P>
   The keiretsu system has long been seen as one of the biggest
barriers to foreign investment in Japan, as well as a significant
contributor to Japan's lack of global competitiveness. Inside the
keiretsu, companies are not forced to compete for financing and
have little incentive to make decisions based on profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Many investment strategists and analysts have assured investors
that global market forces are pressuring the keiretsu to disband.
Yet the Shoei case suggests that keiretsu power is still strong.
Although the president of Fuji Bank has been widely quoted as
saying that he intended to sell off Fuji's stakes in various group
companies, Fuji and its sister insurance companies and trust banks
refused to sell their shares in Shoei.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami demonstrated that Shoei served as a place to give
former directors of Fuji and its sister financial companies, Yasuda
Trust and Banking Co., Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. and
Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co., a second job and a means of
maintaining their golf club memberships and chauffeured car service
after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He also exposed the longstanding Japanese practice of
undervaluing assets, finding 70 billion yen, or more than $648
million, in value over book value in Shoei's real estate holdings,
a situation he says suggests that the company should turn a far
better profit than it has in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motivation in this was not to seize management control but
to increase shareholder value,'' he said. ``I want the existing
management to do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   Murakami said he planned to take his case to the March annual
shareholders' meeting. He said several shareholders, including the
fund management company Arnhold &AMP; S. Bleichroeder, which has a 7.7
percent stake in Shoei, have asked him to serve as their proxy.

   Every reporter who has ever dreamed of a world without editors
might see Jacob Weisberg as a man who has achieved nirvana. Every
libertarian Internetophile who believes that the World Wide Web
will democratize information might see Weisberg, Slate magazine's
leading political correspondent, as the man to unlock the medium's
revolutionary potential.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, would the restless reporters feel if they knew that
Weisberg has thousands of editors _ readers who react instantly and
viscerally to his work? And how would the Net libertarians take it
if they knew that the political news media see Weisberg as one of
their own?
</P>
<P>
   Many old-media hacks, whose conventions (objectivity, anyone?)
were supposed to be exploded by the Web, read his online Ballot Box
submissions regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Slate, the liberal magazine Salon.com and the Web site of the
conservative National Review are cited regularly in The Hotline,
the Washington-based online bible of who wrote what about whom.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, said one old-media correspondent, Weisberg and
some of his online magazine competitors _ Jake Tapper, who reports
for Salon.com, and the National Review's Richard Lowry, John J.
Miller and Ramesh Ponnuru _ are using the Web to create national
alternative newspapers, which publish early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day,'' said Dan Balz, a reporter for The Washington
Post, the Web magazines offer ``the ability to be very irreverent
about all aspects'' of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, whose armies have laid waste to the conventional
beliefs of retailing, brokerage houses and help-wanted advertising,
has had a more subtle impact on political journalism so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's growing legions of campaign reporters have married
into the local population, spreading Web culture in a way
comparable to the way Alexander the Great's troops spread Greek
culture. They wear the local costumes: Daily dispatches on
MSNBC.com seem like wire service wrap-ups; ABCNews.com's brief,
daily reports read like campaign diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg's elegant satire and analysis would seem at home in The
New Republic. Tapper could have dominated an alternative
newspaper's cover with his dogged pursuit of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, for example, in writing about the Republican candidate's
appearance at a fundamentalist university that bans interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference. If this column had been written for
the Web, for instance, by now you might have seen hot links to
everything from a map of Alexander's campaigns to the Bob Jones
University home page. If this had been written for the Web, the
writer's e-mailbox would be clogged with missives from readers
reacting to these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As Weisberg said last week on the telephone, ``At New York
magazine'' _ where he worked before joining Slate in 1996 _ ``I had
to be finished with a story Wednesday morning that would not be
read by people until the next Monday. It was an exercise in
guessing what was going to happen, bluffing, pretending you knew
the results of things you couldn't possibly know.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, he said, ``you're unscoopable. If you have a
good idea, there is no reason not to put it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Slate's editor, Michael Kinsley, lets Weisberg post his
writing unedited. ``He has the car keys,'' Kinsley said. (Weisberg
does have old-media ties as a contributing writer for The New York
Times Magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's political coverage in the online magazines is far
closer to mainstream journalism than Hunter Thompson's manic 1972
work for Rolling Stone or the blaring of talk radio in 1992. Still,
the reader-reaction ``threads'' on the Web sites have talk radio's
visceral feel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And both Slate and Salon.com have actively tweaked tradition
this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the New Hampshire primary, Slate flouted the media
pact to withhold exit-polling data until the polls closed; its
readers learned of projections of the lopsided win by Sen. John
McCain of Arizona in the Republican primary by 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com assigned its contributor Dan Savage to the Iowa
caucuses. He posted a piece saying that, while nursing the flu, he
had licked the doorknobs of the campaign headquarters of Gary
Bauer, the conservative Republican candidate, then licked a pen and
presented it to Bauer. Reader reaction reflected the Web's
emotionalism and ambiguity: If the account was a spoof, one person
wrote, ``it is hugely amusing and creative''; if not, he said, ``it
violates my definition of media ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web journalists do take advantage of their medium. Weisberg,
who at 35 is the dean of the lot; Tapper, 30; and the members of
the National Review's staff, who range in age from 25 (Ponnuru) to
31 (Lowry, the editor), all have their articles forwarded by e-mail
to friends, competitors and sources. All use hyperlinks, which
allow them to make a shorthand reference to an issue, then, via
links, send the reader to the appropriate position paper.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg believes ``the format doesn't have to be as rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more spontaneous,'' he said. ``I was someone who never
used the personal pronoun in writing. In the Internet, your being
there is such an important part of your readers' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As a weekly columnist for MSNBC.com, Howard Fineman, the
Newsweek columnist and political commentator, is getting to know
the Web's horde of impromptu editors. ``My byline is hot-linked,
meaning that as soon as I send my words of wisdom to the world, I
am immediately brought up short by people e-mailing me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponnuru, one of the National Review's on-again, off-again
campaign correspondents, said the medium lends itself to analysis
with attitude; it ``does scramble expectations about what one is
supposed to do and one isn't.'' On Friday, after examining Bush and
McCain's claims and counterclaims in their tax proposals, Ponnuru
and Miller wrote, ``Maybe it's a pointless exercise: McCain knows
that he can wing it and then spin his way out of trouble because
voters aren't thinking about issues. It would be nice if a few
journalists were.''
</P>
<P>
   Such barbs are hardly revolutionary. John Heilemann, who in 1996
was Hotwired.com's campaign correspondent, believes political
coverage on the Web missed its revolutionary moment, because it
transformed from an alien presence to a conventional one so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The moment may have come and gone in 1998, he said. There was no
presidential campaign then, but during the Lewinsky scandal, Matt
Drudge nipped at journalists' flanks, biting off a mixture of
gossip and fact. This time around, Drudge's Web site has been the
dog that did not bark.
</P>
<P>
   Heilemann, who is writing a book on Silicon Valley, said in an
interview, ``So much has happened in the last four years that the
Web doesn't feel avant-garde anymore. We went from the year when it
was off the charts to the year when it was mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to a point. Salon.com's Washington bureau chief, David Weir,
believes that Web-based political journalism has a new emotional
immediacy. And, he said, there is ``an accountability factor _ how
fast your audience can come back to you,'' or check a writer's
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign coverage, he said, shows that ``the whole
relationship between the journalist and the audience is undergoing
a gradual, subtle transformation. But we don't know where it all
leads.''

 &HT;    Therapy may not be the answer for homosexuals
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As reports circulated again of ``reparative
therapy'' to help homosexuals become heterosexual, the American
Psychiatric Association emphasized last week that there is no
clinical evidence of this happening and some evidence that it can
be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual orientation, like gender identity, appears to be
established early in life,'' the APA said in an updated fact sheet
Feb. 5 on ``Homosexual and Bisexual Issues.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging anecdotal reports that psychotherapy has
helped change gay men and lesbians' sexual orientation ``for some
motivated individuals for limited periods of time,'' the
association also said ``such changes often are accompanied by
depression, anxiety and other symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The most useful therapy for homosexuals tends to be that which
deals with the self-hatred that is bred by living in a homophobic
society, said the APA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relief of homophobia allows for better psychological
functioning,'' the statement explained. ``Those who have integrated
their sexual orientation into a positive sense of themselves
function at a healthier psychological level than those who have
not.''

BRITAIN ARRESTS 13 IN HIJACKING OF AFGHAN AIRLINER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Thirteen men were charged Monday with hijacking the
Afghan airliner that spent last week parked on a remote runway at a
British airport with more than 150 people aboard. The men, all
Afghans ages 18 to 36, could face long prison sentences if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   A 14th suspect is still being questioned, the police said, and 6
others arrested in connection with the hijacking were not charged
and will join a group applying for political asylum in Britain. The
Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 was seized while on a domestic flight on
Feb. 6, and landed at Stansted airport, outside London, after stops
in three other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 73 other passengers from the plane who have
also sought asylum are being interviewed about their reasons in
their temporary accommodations, a fire service training center in
Moreton-in-Marsh, a picturesque village in the Cotswolds. And 73
others _ 58 men, 8 women, and 7 children _ left on a chartered
flight for Kandahar, Afghanistan, early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities originally said that only about half that number
actually wanted to go home. But they explained Monday that when the
Afghans began to realize how difficult it might be to gain asylum
here, many more decided to leave. And Monday evening, Channel Four
news reported that officials, sensitive to the perception that
Britain is an easy target for refugees, leaned heavily on the 73 in
an effort to convince them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining passengers have a long road ahead of them,
beginning with hours of interviews by immigration officers, who are
hardly inclined to be sympathetic to their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeking to ascertain whether they are really seeking
asylum, or whether they want to stay for any other reason,'' a
spokesman for the Home Office said of the 73 passengers in
Moreton-in-Marsh. The interviews, conducted with the help of
freelance translators, give asylum applicants the chance to explain
why they fled their country and why they are afraid to return. The
Afghans have to remain on the fire service campus during this time
and are being giving food and clothes, but no money.
</P>
<P>
   If they are not immediately ejected, the Afghans will be settled
somewhere by the government while their applications are being
processed, or while they are appealing their decisions. Also, the
government has been reportedly approaching third countries,
including Pakistan, and asking them to take the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the British home secretary, Jack Straw, said he would
personally rule on the Afghans' asylum requests and would try to
eject them from Britain as soon as possible. But on Sunday, he
seemed to backtrack slightly, telling the BBC that ``everybody
knows that what I do is make the initial decision in asylum cases,
but there is a right of appeal thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asylum applications can be tied up for years in the complicated
appeals process. Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary for the
opposition Conservative Party, accused Straw and the Labor Party
government of deliberately prejudicing the case by his strong words
last week because, she said, he knew all along that any decision to
eject the Afghans would invariably be overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take much gumption to figure out that he is trying
to sound tough while relying on the courts to overrule him and let
these asylum seekers stay,'' she said. ``You can't believe a word
that this Labor lot say.''
</P>
<P>
   The men charged with hijacking the plane, who the police say
were armed with handguns and less powerful weapons, are not
scheduled to reappear in court until March, and then probably will
not be tried for several more months, the police said. Under
British law, there are no minimum sentences for hijacking, but the
suspects could face sentences as long as life in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the hostages who elected to
leave Britain were welcomed with paper flowers, new clothes and
warm words from the Taliban, the Islamic group that controls most
of Afghanistan, when they flew back to the country after their
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Hugging the passengers as they left the plane, the Taliban
foreign minister, Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, accused those who
remained in Britain of seeking a better way of life, not fleeing
political repression at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are economic asylum seekers, not political refugees,'' he
told reporters at the Kandahar airport. And he denied reports that
the hijackers would have been put to death under the harsh Taliban
code of justice had they returned home. ``They would have faced
sentences of seven years in jail if found guilty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The returning passengers called Britain an ``infidel'' country
and said they were relieved to be back in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a Muslim country _ how could we stay?'' one
passenger told Reuters. ``And the weather was depressing and the
food was awful.''

   GA-STORMS-NYT (Camilla, Ga.) _ Tornadoes tore through a section
of southwest Georgia overnight, killing more than 20 people and
injuring at least 100, shearing off roofs, uprooting statuesque
pecan trees and snapping off pines like toothpicks. Gov. Roy Barnes
flew over the hardest-hit areas in a helicopter and reported that
an estimated 200 to 300 houses had been struck. ``There's a swath
about 10 miles long and 1 and a half miles wide,'' Barnes said.
``There's a mobile home park on the south side of town that just

him as he stood, unarmed, in the lobby of his apartment building in
the Bronx. With Diallo's parents and his own family in the front

   BRAZIL-COPTERS (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ At night the skyline in

easily remind visitors of Manhattan. But something is different.
Many of the lights are moving. The skies of Sao Paulo, Latin
America's financial capital and the richest big city in the
developing world, are filled with helicopters. Like a fleet of
airborne limousines, the helicopters are increasingly used by
privileged Paulistanos to commute, attend meetings, even run

   MCCAIN-STYLE (Columbia, S.C.) _ As much John McCain's openness
is about free publicity, more and more now it appears to be about
something broader _ a half-thought-out effort to turn back the
clock on how American presidential campaigns are conducted in
search of a more personable, less antagonistic, less scripted time.
there are whole days now when his entire candidacy revolves not
around issues like tax cuts or foreign policy but on questions of
how political campaigns should be waged. The senator's signature
drive to ban big money from politics is just the start of it.
McCain has announced unilaterally that he will no longer run
negative ads and the decision seems cathartic, lightening his mood.

   BUS-POLLUTION (Undated) _ Buses powered by compressed natural
gas _ long viewed as the cleanest alternative to diesel buses _
don't provide any more environmental benefits than buses powered by
a combination of diesel and electicrity, according to a study that
could have broad implications for vehicle fleets nationwide.
Municipal bus fleets around the country have come under pressure to
switch to compressed natural gas as a way to reduce pollution, with
Los Angeles and other municipalities converting their whole fleets
to this technology. But New York City, which has enormous influence
on the bus market because of the size of its purchases, has held
off switching to compressed natural gas, citing costs and questions
about the technology. By Randy Kennedy.

&HT;     YOUNG, RICE REMAIN IN LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Just because Steve Young and Jerry Rice
are among 40 players the San Francisco 49ers have under contract
after the great Salary Cap Purge of 2000 does not necessarily mean
they will be with the team next season.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the club is not through tweaking its roster in
the wake of its worst season in 20 years. Between now and the draft
in April, the 49ers will attempt to sign their own free agents and,
cap room permitting, pursue players on the free agent market.
</P>
<P>
   The team's most immediate needs are at quarterback, cornerback,
defensive end and offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event Steve would not be with us, if he retires, we're
going to be ready to know who we're going to pursue,'' coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``A lot will depend on if Steve surprises us and
says he's going to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said the 38-year-old quarterback
will make a decision on his football future in April.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rice, it appears the 49ers would like him to return for a
16th season, but not at his current salary cap number of $5.49
million. If Rice does not agree to a restructured contract, it
would not be surprising if the 49ers waived him after June 1, when
roster moves impact the salary cap in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jerry has made up his mind to play for this contract and
this contract only, we'll have to decide if we can absorb that,''
general manager Bill Walsh said. ``We want him back. We would like
very much to have Jerry playing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Because negotiations between the 49ers and Rice's agent, Jim
Steiner, stalled, the club decided to put off contract talks until
another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll address Jerry Rice's circumstances further and then come
to an agreement as soon as we can,'' Walsh said. ``There's no
timetable. It will be our job, and Jerry's representatives, to come
to an agreement. We have to reach agreement. We're not going to
publicly state what has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's 37 and two years removed from a serious knee
injury, Rice was the 49ers' best wide receiver in 1999, catching 67
passes for 830 yards and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to know what interest he has in playing for the 49ers
again,'' Mariucci said. ``He assured me he would like to play again
and I assured him we would like to have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   More cap room must be cleared if the 49ers are to sign their own
free agents, in particular defensive tackle Junior Bryant, tight
end Greg Clark, safety Zack Bronson and kicker Wade Richey. Of the
four, Bryant is the only unrestricted free agent; the 49ers made
contract tenders to Clark, Bronson and Richey to secure their
negotiation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Young restructured his contract in such a way as to save the
49ers a little more than $3 million in salary cap money. The club
is now about $3.5 million under the cap, which should be enough to
make a serious offer to Bryant, who is free to negotiate with any
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in the process of as soon as possible reaching an
agreement,'' Walsh said. ``I know personally he would like to play
for the San Francisco 49ers. We'll be in competition for Junior but
we feel confident.''

BY A TORTUOUS PATH, INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT OVERTAKES HIS GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the end, President Abdurrahman Wahid got
just what he wanted Monday: the suspension of his troublesome
general along with new affirmations of support from the country's
querulous military.
</P>
<P>
   He took a long, zigzagging road to get there, but the hairpin
turns themselves now seem to have been part of the plan, a method
one expert called ``confuse and rule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself in his shoes,'' said Daniel S. Lev, an expert on
Indonesia who is a professor at the University of Washington.
``What would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   This is a president without a personal power base, presiding
over a fractured political scene, who has taken on the institution
from which his predecessors drew their power: the military.
</P>
<P>
   So he bobs and weaves, pushes and retreats, cracks a joke or two
and leaves his opponents to try to figure out what he is up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what appeared to be all kinds of uncertainty,
ambiguity, ambivalence,'' said Lev, speaking of Wahid's two weeks
of verbal jabbing and poking as he tried to get his stubborn
security minister, Gen. Wiranto, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president is pragmatic, changeable and impulsive by
nature, often exasperating even his own subordinates. ``But what is
important here,'' Lev said, ``is that Wiranto was bamboozled, he
was in a corner and didn't know how to get out, and now he's out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid had begun calling for the resignation after an independent
commission recommended the general's prosecution for his role in
the deaths of hundreds of people in East Timor after the former
Dutch colony voted in August to become independent of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In a final flurry of confusion _ experts here are now arguing
over whether the president was consistent or inconsistent _ Wahid
first told Wiranto that he could stay on as coordinating minister
for security affairs, then told him he must step aside as an
``inactive'' cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bravely bearing the burden of spokesman for this confusing
president, Marsilam Simanjuntak asserted Monday morning that there
had been no change in policy. He seemed to be trying to pronounce a
tongue twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reversal of the decision,'' he said. ``He is not
in an active status now, so practically or theoretically he is
still a nonactive member of the cabinet. I'm not playing with words
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The general accepted his suspension gracefully, and the chief of
the armed forces restated the military's allegiance to civilian
control _ clear and significant victories for the president.
</P>
<P>
   And they were the result of planning, not impulse, said
Aristedes Katoppo, an editor who is a leading political analyst.
Wahid is like a winding river, he said, twisting and turning to
avoid obstacles but flowing consistently downhill toward its goal,
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur looks as if he is meandering neither east nor west,''
he said, using the president's nickname. ``But in fact he has two
consistent principles. One is nonviolence and the other is
democratization, which includes demilitarization.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's brother, Salehudin Wahid, was quoted by local newspapers
last week as saying, ``I think it is impossible for the president
to express inconsistent statements because I know that whatever he
says, there is an underlying meaning which we do not understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's behavior may be particularly confusing to
non-Indonesians, Katoppo suggested. Mostly, people here seemed more
amused than upset over Wahid's seemingly erratic behavior, and less
concerned over the possibility of a coup than foreign investors,
who drove down the value of the currency, the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for most Indonesians the outcome was fairly clear from
the start,'' Katoppo said. ``It was kind of a soap opera, maybe
intended as an education in the rule of law, but there was no real
suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama weakened the general, who seemed sometimes bewildered
by two weeks of ``suggestions'' that he resign, issued from
successive stops on a 13-nation tour by the president.
</P>
<P>
   But his suspension from the cabinet is, in principle,
reversible. It depends on the outcome of the investigation by the
attorney general into the general's responsibility for the deaths
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   After repeatedly denying culpability as he refused to step down,
Wiranto appeared to reverse field on both counts Monday, admitting
command responsibility for the abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say I was involved in human rights violations,'' the
general said, according to local reporters. ``Instead, as long as I
was responsible for national security, I am responsible for those
human rights violations in East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement generally conforms with the accusations against
him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The timing of both Wiranto's removal and his concession of
responsibility seemed significant, coming on the eve of the arrival
here of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has separately investigated the abuses in
East Timor, and Wahid has said he wants to pre-empt an
international war crimes tribunal by conducting a credible
investigation and trial here. The Indonesian commission named 33
military and civilian figures, including Wiranto, as responsible
for the killings and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Singapore on Monday, Annan made it clear that the
Security Council could still step in with its own tribunal if it is
not satisfied with Indonesia's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that the Indonesian government seems determined to
hold those responsible accountable,'' he said. ``The council, which
also has a report, is going to keep an eye on this process, and at
this stage it is not going to set up a tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Without a strong traditional power base, Wahid derives much of
his support from the fact that for now he seems to be the only hope
Indonesians have for real reforms. Other potential leaders are less
democratic and more divisive in their outlooks and positions.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly two years after the fall of President Suharto, there
is still clearly an urgent national consensus for thoroughgoing
change.
</P>
<P>
   Public support, kept alive by his very open style of leadership,
is Wahid's strongest source of power, experts here said. But by
speaking off the cuff and by staking out positions and then
abandoning them, he does risk losing the fear and respect he needs
to govern.
</P>
<P>
   A number of his supporters have warned him to be more careful _
to count to 10, as it were, before he speaks. On the other hand,
lightness of being seems to be his main weapon, and shield, in the
dangerous game he is playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my remarks were misunderstood, then I apologize,'' he said
last year, after offending someone with one of his jokes. ``What's
the big deal? There's no need to be angry.''

CHARLES SCHULZ, 1922-2000

<P>
   Charles Schulz labored for 50 years over a cartoon strip whose
name, chosen by his syndicate, he vehemently disliked. Once
``Peanuts'' took off, he was stuck with it, and he proceeded to ink
the mistitled feature to the greatest success of any comic strip in
the history of newspapers. It was the sort of irony that Schulz not
only appreciated but savored in more than 18,250 strips that
appeared from 1950 until Sunday, the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to forget how revolutionary ``Peanuts'' was when it
landed in the 1950s comics landscape. Suddenly, real children were
set free alongside the ``gagged'' worlds of Dagwood, Blondie,
Beetle Bailey, and the exploits of various caped crusaders. Charlie
Brown, Lucy, Linus, and the rest of the cast were by turns anxious,
dreamy, sadistic, jealous, lonely, and in love. In a gray flannel
culture congratulating itself on the steady march of success, there
_ on the funny pages _ was a meditation on the meaning of failure.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Schulz's half-century of graphic theater was the
pursuit of grace through perseverance. That was the theme of his
own craftsmanship, as well. He never hired inkers to do his drawing
or writers to feed him gags. He honed a drawing style that looked
naive but hid a keen sense of balance, design, and economy of
expression. He studied the timing of earlier cartoonists and
comedians and wrote as sparely as he drew.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Schulz remained deeply insecure. ``I'm a nonentity.
Except that I draw,'' he told his hometown paper, the Santa Rosa
(Calif.) Press Democrat in 1997. But when he drew or talked about
drawing, his Charlie Brown neurosis was erased. ``I'm sorry for
people who have to live through others. We see so much of that. I
guess I think about it when I go to a concert and hear a pianist
play a Brahms concerto or when I saw Willie Mays make a great
catch. I think at least I have something I can do. And I'm doing it
as well as anyone's ever done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans of the comics pages offer our standing ovation.

THE MISSING TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is never too late to learn the truth about certain things.
Recently declassified documents about the CIA's shameful role in
the murder of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi in Chile, during the
repression that followed General Augusto Pinochet's 1973 military
putsch, ought to be welcomed by every American who understands how
fragile democracy can be.
</P>
<P>
   A part of Horman's story was told in the 1982 Costa-Gavras
movie, ``Missing.'' The film dramatized how US officials withheld
information about Horman's murder from his family.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after Pinochet's security forces murdered Horman and
Teruggi, the State Department conducted two internal reviews of the
crime and a subsequent coverup. The reviews were prompted by a
former Chilean intelligence officer who said he was present when
Pinochet's intelligence chief said Horman knew too much _
presumably about US involvement in the coup _ and had to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rafael Gonzalez, the eyewitness, someone he took to
be an American was present when that verdict was passed on Horman.
The files of the two State Department reviews were heavily blacked
out by CIA censors in 1976. The uncensored files, described in
Sunday's New York Times, say: ``US intelligence may have played an
unfortunate part in Horman's death,'' either by providing and
confirming information about him or by doing ``nothing to
discourage the logical outcome of government of Chile paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did the right thing when he ordered the files
declassified after Pinochet was indicted in Spain for crimes
against humanity. The next step should be an effort to identify the
Chilean who gave the order for Horman's murder and any Americans
who knew about it. There should also be a wider search for the full
story of Washington's complicity in Pinochet's coup.
</P>
<P>
   The terrible truth about those old crimes is that they disclose
a dalliance with fascism abroad. Horman and Teruggi perished
because of that betrayal of American ideals.

   New computerized scans on cutting edge of cardiac care
</P>
<P>
   By Kevin Lamb
</P>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ Through special glasses, the picture on the
computer screen looks like a model of a heart. The distinct,
three-dimensional chambers, the thicket of arteries heading toward
the lungs, the spine in the background _ it is all very lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   To be more precise, it's alive. The image in Kettering Medical
Center's radiology department compiles advanced X-ray scans of a
person's heart, resting between beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at the heart and turn it around as if it's in
your own hands,'' said Dr. Ziwar Karabatak, a Kettering
cardiologist who saw the image last week for the first time. ``It's
something like a dream that you thought could happen one day. But
it's reality now.''
</P>
<P>
   Karabatak and the other doctors who first see this computerized
tomography (CT) image ``want to use it tomorrow,'' says Bilal
Ezzeddine, Kettering's imaging project director, who has two
Ph.D.s. But stunning as it is to see a heart jump off the screen in
three dimensions, Ezzeddine says Kettering's researchers ``aren't
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They plan to develop a safer, faster and cheaper way of
discovering early stages of heart disease and diagnosing the
symptoms that send people to hospitals. As Ezzeddine envisions it,
the CT technology will be an interim step. The ultimate goal is to
use a single magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device not only for
``virtual heart'' replications, but also to perform the gamut of
cardiac diagnostic tests that now require four machines.
</P>
<P>
   Working with manufacturer Siemens Medical Systems of Iselin,
N.J., Kettering is one of only five hospitals worldwide
investigating digital imagery to find out if it can assess
cardiovascular disease as reliably as an angiogram, the diagnostic
gold standard performed through a catheter to the cardiac arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to angiograms is they involve sticking a tube
through the patient's arteries and shooting dye through it. That
carries risks. But unless digital imagery can predict heart disease
as accurately as an angiogram, it won't matter how much safer it
is.
</P>
<P>
   To determine that, Kettering researchers are examining both
types of pictures of the same patients, and comparing how well they
illustrate the extent of the patients' heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologists already use high-speed CT scans to look for heart
disease in patients without symptoms. The Dayton Heart Hospital has
been doing that since it opened in September, Kettering will start
using its scanner for screening soon and Good Samaritan Hospital
has ordered a machine for the same purpose _ giving the Dayton area
one of the highest ratios of fast scanners to population in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The screening CT scans can detect heart disease in people who
feel fine, enabling them to change their diets or add medication so
it doesn't become serious.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering's research is aimed more at people whose hearts
already are causing problems. When they come to the emergency room
with chest pains, faster diagnosis makes for faster medical
treatment _ maybe drugs to dissolve a blood clot, maybe balloon
angioplasty to open a blocked cardiac artery, maybe surgery to
bypass the clogged artery. The faster the treatment, the less
damage to heart muscle, says Dave Seidel, Kettering's director of
cardiac services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only able to do this because we have the imaging
infrastructure already in place,'' Ezzeddine says. Siemens brings
people to Kettering from all over to see its system for storing and
transmitting medical images on computer disks and a faster, lighter
MRI machine that's one of about 10 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   MRIs have traditionally been too slow to capture a heart's image
between beats, but the new unit displays the beating heart more
seamlessly than streaming video on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After focusing its MRI energy on brains for the last few years,
Kettering is just beginning to turn its attention to the body's
other command center. ``You could argue the heart is the more
important one,'' Ezzeddine says, ``because heart disease is the
leading cause of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Where CT scans can display the geographic layout of an organ, an
MRI also can depict the chemical activity within that geography.
High activity of certain chemicals in the brain indicates a tumor.
Low activity of other chemicals in the heart indicates dead muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The MRI uses colors to show how much of a chemical is present,
so it can illustrate a diseased heart with the rainbow spectrum
from robust red areas to dead violet areas. It's comparable to a
color-coded U.S. map that shows high concentrations of population
on the East Coast and low ones in Wyoming and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other ways of showing a muscle's viability, but this
way we can see it earlier,'' says Mehdi Adineh, Kettering's
Ph.D.-level senior MRI physicist. And only the MRI can show the
geography of a cardiac artery blockage and the inactivity of dead
heart muscle on the same image.
</P>
<P>
   They're a relevant package, says Seidel, because hospitals waste
millions of dollars uselessly rerouting blood vessels to nourish
heart tissue that is already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those millions aren't there to waste anymore. In fact, with
health plans reimbursing hospital services at ``40 to 45 cents on
the dollar,'' Seidel says there aren't enough profits to fully fund
this imaging research, being overseen by cardiologist Dr. Robert
Kiefaber and radiologist Dr. Richard McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to seek external funding,'' Seidel says, making
Kettering's partnerships with Siemens and Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base all the more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the MRI research is making the cardiac arteries
more visible, Ezzeddine says. When the scientists figure out how to
show them clearly on MRIs, the resulting one-station diagnoses will
be not only safer, faster and cheaper, but also less confusing,
with all relevant information on a single image.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzeddine is eager to see how the heart doctors apply all this
information. He knows they won't close down the catheterization
labs just because diagnostic angiograms become obsolete. Caths will
still be needed for balloon angioplasty, for example, in which
tubing is run through the arteries to open up a narrowing heart
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have so many intricate, new ways of navigating blood
vessels to repair cardiovascular disease that it is spawning a new
specialty, cardiac intervention, in which Karabatak is
board-certified. They snake their instruments through the vessels
and fix them from the inside without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Without cutting the patient open, though, the doctor can't see
what he or she is doing. The angiograms and other two-dimensional
images don't show exactly how the blood vessels are twisted or
bent. So Karabatak says he tries to visualize what a stack of
two-dimensional CT scans would look like in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the computer does that for me,'' he says of the image that
so excited him last week. ``You can see and anticipate possible
complications before you get to them. It takes away a lot of
guessing.''

from robust red areas to dead violet areas. It's comparable to a
color-coded U.S. map that shows high concentrations of population
on the East Coast and low ones in Wyoming and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other ways of showing a muscle's viability, but this
way we can see it earlier,'' says Mehdi Adineh, Kettering's
Ph.D.-level senior MRI physicist. And only the MRI can show the
geography of a cardiac artery blockage and the inactivity of dead
heart muscle on the same image.
</P>
<P>
   They're a relevant package, says Seidel, because hospitals waste
millions of dollars uselessly rerouting blood vessels to nourish
heart tissue that is already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those millions aren't there to waste anymore. In fact, with
health plans reimbursing hospital services at ``40 to 45 cents on
the dollar,'' Seidel says there aren't enough profits to fully fund
this imaging research, being overseen by cardiologist Dr. Robert
Kiefaber and radiologist Dr. Richard McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to seek external funding,'' Seidel says, making
Kettering's partnerships with Siemens and Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base all the more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the MRI research is making the cardiac arteries
more visible, Ezzeddine says. When the scientists figure out how to
show them clearly on MRIs, the resulting one-station diagnoses will
be not only safer, faster and cheaper, but also less confusing,
with all relevant information on a single image.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzeddine is eager to see how the heart doctors apply all this
information. He knows they won't close down the catheterization
labs just because diagnostic angiograms become obsolete. Caths will
still be needed for balloon angioplasty, for example, in which
tubing is run through the arteries to open up a narrowing heart
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have so many intricate, new ways of navigating blood
vessels to repair cardiovascular disease that it is spawning a new
specialty, cardiac intervention, in which Karabatak is
board-certified. They snake their instruments through the vessels
and fix them from the inside without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Without cutting the patient open, though, the doctor can't see
what he or she is doing. The angiograms and other two-dimensional
images don't show exactly how the blood vessels are twisted or
bent. So Karabatak says he tries to visualize what a stack of
two-dimensional CT scans would look like in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the computer does that for me,'' he says of the image that
so excited him last week. ``You can see and anticipate possible
complications before you get to them. It takes away a lot of
guessing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fortune 500 corporations supporting campaign finance reform
because they are sick of being ``shaken down.'' Religious
organizations demanding that politicians stop taking the Lord's
name in vain. A Web site aimed at seniors and soccer moms called
``overthrowthegov.com.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   The talisman of tax cuts has lost some of its magic this season
_ in New Hampshire, where voters would rather pay down the debt,
and in Massachusetts, where they would rather pay off the Dig.
Voters weary of finger-to-the-wind politicians have stopped talking
to pollsters in such numbers that candidates are advised to
discount surveys with a sample of fewer than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In disparate, inchoate ways, Americans are shaking themselves
out of a long winter's nap, finding new ways to participate in a
political system that once seemed hopelessly mired in
business-as-usual. This week an array of religious groups will
convene a Call to Renewal, designed to inject issues of poverty and
race into the presidential debate. Similar efforts by other
faith-based organizations have called the bluff of candidates who
are mouthing personal pieties. Taken together these alliances may
signal an end to an exclusive claim on moral issues by
ultra-conservatives and a return to more mainstream religious
values, such as Love Thy Neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Grassroots organizing is catching fire in unusual places. The
Committee for Economic Development, which includes over 200
corporate members, has joined forces with Common Cause to fight the
influence of money in politics. A handful of companies _ Monsanto,
Time-Warner, General Motors _ have gone beyond grousing about
political extortion to risk unilateral disarmament. They have
stopped soft-money contributions, hoping to starve a corrupt
system.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of a nascent movement are always difficult to read,
but this much seems clear: After a long period of partisan rancor,
the impeachment follies, official mendacity, and abandonment, the
political middle is pushing back.

BYPASSING MARRIAGE IS INCREASINGLY THE NORM FOR AMERICANS, STUDY
SHOWS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of couples who live together out of wedlock, often
with children, is increasing rapidly, a new study reports.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by a sociologist at the Institute for Social Research
at the University of Michigan, reports that about two in five
children will spend at least some time living with their mother and
her unmarried partner. Less often, children will live with their
father and his partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the public will be surprised that almost half of
all children will be likely to experience this type of household,''
said Pamela J. Smock, the sociologist who prepared the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested that the number of children believed
to be living in single-parent homes may be significantly
exaggerated. About 40 percent of children born outside of marriage
are actually living in homes with two adults, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large share of children born to supposedly `single' mothers
today are born into two-parent households,'' Smock wrote.
``Moreover, the widely cited increase in recent years in nonmarital
childbearing is largely due to cohabitation, and not to births to
women living without a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was an effort to bring focus to dozens of reports on
the subject that have been done scattershot over the last decade or
so. Drawing a broad portrait of the American family as it has been
redefined since the 1960s, the study found that cohabitation _ both
before and in lieu of marriage _ has become so commonplace that it
is practically the norm, and that it crosses most boundaries of
age, income and race.
</P>
<P>
   The study is to be published this summer in the 2000 volume of
the Annual Review of Sociology. Among its findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-six percent of all marriages between 1990 and 1994 were
preceded by cohabitation. From 1965 to 1974, that figure was about
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 1987 to 1995, the number of women in their late 30s who
reported having cohabited rose to 48 percent from 30 percent
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-five percent of people who live together end up
marrying, but 40 percent later divorce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cohabitation does not mean childlessness. About half of the
divorced people who live together have children in the household,
as do 35 percent of those who have never married.
</P>
<P>
   Experts generally agree about the main reasons for the rise in
cohabitation. Some are obvious, like the cultural revolution that
began in the 1960s, removing the stigma from sex out of wedlock.
But others go further back, including a divorce rate that, while
now level, climbed over the last century. Children of divorce are
less likely to marry and divorced adults are more likely to live
together than marry. The marriage rate in America was 8.3 per 1,000
people in 1998, the lowest since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists, including Smock, said the fact that many
children are, despite earlier assumptions, living with both parents
did not mean they were living in stable households. They pointed to
the generally short-lived nature of cohabitation, as well as to
studies suggesting a greater level of discontent among people who
live together than among married couples.
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement among sociologists over whether
cohabitation is replacing marriage or simply serving as a new stage
of engagement. A third view, less widely held, suggests that it may
be a phenomenon affecting primarily single people who may never
marry.
</P>
<P>
   The main effect, many sociologists agree, may well be on the
growing number of children being raised in such households.
Although only about 11 percent of children are born to cohabiting
parents, the number seems likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the ability to explain the social change, experts
say, is that it comes against a backdrop of marriage itself being
redefined. As women play a bigger role as income providers and more
men assume child care duties, the traditional notion of a typical
household has altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying issue is whether we can gauge what cohabitation
means if we are using a standard that is also changing,'' the
report said.

COMMENTARY: THE HACKERS' LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To whoever it was out there in cyberspace who launched last
week's ``smurf'' attacks that temporarily crippled Yahoo,
Amazon.com, E-Trade, eBay and CNN.com by overloading their web
servers with fake requests for data, let me just say on behalf of
all of us: Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, thank you for doing us all a favor, which is highlighting
the vulnerabilities of an increasingly wired world, but doing it in
a calibrated fashion _ not so powerful that you did any lasting
damage, but powerful and brazen enough to get everyone galvanized
to address the threat. You, dear cybervandals, have imparted three
critically important lessons to the American public that no
presidential speechifying could match.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson (NU)1: When the walls between nations start to get blown
away, and the world gets increasingly wired into networks, everyone
becomes potentially super-empowered, including individuals and
vandals. What makes an Amazon.com so potentially powerful and
possibly lucrative? It's the fact that in a wired world a single
bookstore can now reach into 180 different countries, and be
reached into from 180 different countries. Amazon is a
super-empowered library.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this same wired world also super-empowers angry
people. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire allegedly
responsible for blowing up two U.S. embassies in East Africa, is a
super-empowered angry man. He had his own network, a sort of Jihad
Online (JOL), which he used to take on the U.S. and kill Americans.
And do you know what we did to him? We fired 75 cruise missiles at
him. We fired 75 cruise missiles &UR; at a person! &LR;  That was a
superpower versus a super-empowered angry man.
</P>
<P>
   We saw the Web version of that last week. Some super-empowered
cybervandal, probably working on a PC out of a basement somewhere,
was able to cripple the world's biggest commercial Web sites. The
balance of power changes in a wired world. The whales get bigger,
but the minnows get stronger. The threat today is not that Osama
bin Laden, or Joe Super-Cybervandal, can ever become superpowers.
The threat today is how many people can become Osama bin Laden and
Joe Super-Cybervandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson (NU)2: One of the first reactions people had to the
attacks on the popular Web sites was: Did they take any of my
personal data or credit card numbers? This highlights another
vulnerability in the wired world _ the danger from Little Brother.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in a wired world, where an increasing number of
people surf, learn, shop, gamble and satisfy their sexual fantasies
online, is that you leave a trail of electronic fingerprints
everywhere you go now. As one headline on CNET asked last week:
``Is Your Computer a Smoking Gun?'' It may be, because today
everyone from your favorite hotel chain to your favorite Web site
to your local video store is amassing information about you and
storing it electronically more easily than ever before _ sometimes
innocently, sometimes to sell it to marketers. The Internet
advertising firm Double-Click Inc. recently announced plans to
track Internet users as they moved through the World Wide Web and
to link the electronic trail they leave behind with people's actual
names and addresses (supposedly only with their permission).
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is no Big Brother collecting all these data, but
there are a lot of Little Brothers _ Web sites, hotel chains,
advertisers _ collecting it, with little supervision. So beware of
Little Brother, not Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson (NU)3: The only one who can possibly protect you from the
super-empowered angry people, or the Little Brothers, is Uncle Sam.
Yeah, guess what? Despite all this wiring and virtual interaction,
government still matters. In fact, it matters more now in the
cyber-age, not less. The notion that in the cyber-age the state
will, or should, disappear or become some virtual entity _ ``Look,
ma, no atoms!'' _ is nonsense. Who's tracking down the latest
cybervandals? The FBI. Who's the only one who can protect you from
cyber-attacks on your private data? The government _ and we need to
make sure it has the resources and the laws to ensure that if
anyone wants your data he has to negotiate with you first.
</P>
<P>
   So Joe Super-Cybervandal, wherever you are, thank you. Thank
you. You have given us all the best 21st-century civics lesson you
possibly could _ and with just one click.
</P>

MOVE BY AN AUDACIOUS INTERNET START-UP STARTLES ASIAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Politics and the ambitions of a seductive Internet
start-up have thrown Asian markets into confusion over a proposed
merger between two of the region's communications giants, Cable and
Wireless HKT Ltd. of Hong Kong and Singapore Telecommunications
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 10 months old and already bigger than Amazon.com in terms
of market capitalization, the Hong Kong Internet upstart Pacific
Century CyberWorks Ltd. raised an additional $1 billion from its
shareholders Monday in what analysts said was part of an audacious
plan by the company's 33-year-old billionaire chairman, Richard Li,
to buy a stake in Cable and Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
   CyberWorks announced on Friday that it was considering such a
bid. Cable and Wireless HKT and Singapore Telecom said their own
merger talks, disclosed three weeks ago, were still in progress.
Cable and Wireless HKT confirmed that CyberWorks had approached its
parent company, Cable and Wireless PLC of Britain, about a merger
and that financial advisers from both companies had met over the
weekend, but said that CyberWorks had not yet made a firm proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was plenty of speculation Monday whether a
CyberWorks bid would complement or compete with Singapore Telecom.
While some analysts and investment bankers said an effort was under
way to carve up Cable and Wireless HKT, others saw the CyberWorks
proposal as a politically motivated attempt to reduce British
ownership of the company while preventing Hong Kong's nearly
130-year-old telecommunications operator from falling into the
hands of the government-controlled Singapore Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that China, which reclaimed Hong Kong from
Britain in 1997, would like greater control of Hong Kong's
telecommunications industries. It is also well known that
Cyberworks' chairman is the son of the Hong Kong multibillionaire
Li Ka-shing, whose company Hutchison Whampoa is already a major
provider of the territory's wireless phones. The elder Li,
moreover, has enormous influence among China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has always wanted the Hong Kong telecommunications
situation to be resolved,'' said Dylan Tinker, an analyst with
Deutsche Securities in Hong Kong. ``This would keep majority equity
ownership in China-friendly hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyberworks is so young that it has yet to turn a profit or even
begin marketing its services. That it could make a serious bid for
a $41 billion company is testimony to the frenzy for technology and
telecommunications stocks in Asia. In just a few months, Internet
euphoria has largely displaced concerns about the slow pace of
financial reforms in the aftermath of the region's financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It also illustrates how in Asia, the enthusiasm among investors
for almost any company associated with the creation of the
so-called new economy is buttressing some of the region's old
family fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Li is already a veteran deal maker. In 1993, he sold
the family television network, StarTV, to Rupert Murdoch. Last
year, CyberWorks said it had acquired stakes in 13 high-technology
ventures for $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The parent Cable and Wireless PLC owns 54 percent of its Hong
Kong namesake. Chinese companies own roughly 18 percent. Several
reports have said that talks with Singapore Telecom are snagged on
the insistence by Cable and Wireless HKT that the Singapore
government's voting rights be limited well below its roughly 40
percent stake in a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   CyberWorks officials could not be reached for comment. Officials
for both Cable and Wireless HKT and Singapore Telecom declined to
comment on CyberWorks' proposed bid or the speculation surrounding
it.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless remained insistent that its original merger
plan still made sense despite reservations among analysts about the
wisdom of combining two incumbent operators so far away from each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distance is irrelevant in telecoms these days,'' said Simon
Smith, manager of investor relations at Cable and Wireless HKT.
``The industry is about global consolidation, customers, service
development.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ At night the skyline in this city of 16
million is a dazzling display of lights that can easily remind
visitors of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But something is different. Many of the lights are moving.
</P>
<P>
   The skies of Sao Paulo, Latin America's financial capital and
the richest big city in the developing world, are filled with
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Like a fleet of airborne limousines, the helicopters are
increasingly used by privileged Paulistanos to commute, attend
meetings, even run errands and go to church. Helicopter landing
pads are now standard features of many of Sao Paulo's guarded
residential compounds and high-rise roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating what may be a Blade-Runner-esque glimpse of the
future in metropolises where rich and poor are crammed together,
helicopters are the vehicle of choice for more than just their
convenience. Many of the roads here are hopelessly clogged with
traffic. Carjackings, kidnappings of executives and roadside
robberies have become a part of the risks of daily life for anyone
perceived to have money.
</P>
<P>
   So the demand for private helicopters in Sao Paulo has turned
the city into one of the most vibrant markets for helicopter
dealers. For pilots, navigating the city by air is like flying
through an endless concrete maze.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite time to fly is at night, because the sensation is
equaled only in movies or in dreams,'' said Moacir da Silva, the
president of the Sao Paulo Helicopter Pilots Association. ``The
lights are everywhere, as if I were flying within a Christmas
tree.''
</P>
<P>
   At 400 and growing, the total fleet of private helicopters in
Sao Paulo is the biggest of any city in the developing world and
trails only those in New York and Tokyo. The growth has quickened
in recent years, even with the slowdown in Brazil's economy after
the currency devaluation crisis a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazil's economy grew less than 1 percent in 1999, the
nation's helicopter fleet rose more than 7 percent, to nearly 800.
Most of that growth was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sao Paulo commands the most favorable characteristics of any
city in the world for the civil helicopter industry,'' said Fabrice
Cagnat, the president of the Brazilian subsidiary of Eurocopter, a
venture between DaimlerChrysler and Aerospatiale of France.
</P>
<P>
   The most favorable is the traffic, a byproduct of Sao Paulo's
haphazard expansion in recent decades as millions of migrants from
poorer parts of Brazil moved here in search of work. Roads were
never sufficiently widened or expanded to accommodate the swelling
population. Subway lines can barely handle a fraction of the
residents, and an efficient freeway system remains a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   With the city's crazy-quilt layout that is part Los Angeles,
because of sheer horizontal breadth, and part New York, because
skyscrapers are so numerous, navigating by car is daunting. Recent
efforts to limit automobiles in circulation have not helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is time, and the time lost in traffic is substantial,''
said Marco Antonio Audi, the Brazil representative for Robinson
Helicopters, which is based in Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The use of helicopters to avoid traffic has grown to the point
where some people use their choppers to commute daily to work or to
retreat to their country estates or beach homes every few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``One member of my congregation regularly comes to Sabbath
service by helicopter to escape the horrendous Friday night
traffic,'' said Henry Sobel, the senior rabbi of Sao Paulo's
largest synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The most affordable and best-selling helicopter in Brazil is the
Robinson R44, which can comfortably seat three or four people. It
costs about $380,000, or roughly 90 times the average annual income
of a Sao Paulo resident. Another popular model is the Bell 407,
which seats as many as seven people and costs about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why settle for an armored BMW when you can afford a
helicopter?'' said Eric Wasson, a Latin American sales
representative for Bell Helicopter of Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters of Sao Paulo are not universally admired by any
means. Critics consider them an obscene barometer of the financial
power enjoyed by the affluent few in a sea of poverty. According to
the World Bank, Brazil's richest 10 percent control more than 50
percent of the country's wealth, while the poorest 10 percent
control less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier for a wealthy person to buy a helicopter than it is
for a working-class person to buy a car. Rich Paulistanos have
access to financing that often is substantially cheaper than
domestic lending rates, and more financing options are emerging.
Debis, the financing arm of DaimlerChrysler, recently opened an
office here that will largely focus on helicopter deals.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when credit for buying a home or an automobile remains
prohibitively expensive as one of the lingering effects of last
year's financial crisis, such contrasts are not lost on the vast
majority of people in Sao Paulo who cannot afford a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the contradictions of the Brazilian character is the
capacity for great warmth to coexist with an extreme
individualism,'' said Renato Janine Ribeiro, a professor of
political philosophy at the University of Sao Paulo. ``The desire
for a helicopter is a result of a complete lack of concern for
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the helicopters as a symbol of a worsening class
distinction in Brazil and are outraged that the rich and powerful
have taken to the skies while the rest of society is left to deal
with the precarious conditions on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there is an archipelago of wealthy consumers that is able
to use helicopters just as their counterparts do in Manhattan or
Bombay or wherever doesn't surprise me,'' said Jorge Wilheim, an
urban planner. ``But the ocean of people surrounding this
archipelago should be getting the transportation services they
need, and they are not.''

   SALUDA, S.C. _ Moving toward Tuesday's critical debate in the
Republican primary race, Governor George W. Bush hinted Monday he
would attack Senator John S. McCain's record, while McCain charged
Bush with conducting a ``trash and garbage offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two camps continued high. And as polls
showed Bush and McCain locked in a virtual tie in South Carolina,
where primary on Saturday could determine the outcome of the
Republican race, the candidates struggled to hammer home their
plans to change the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, returning here after a day home in Austin, Texas, said he
would highlight ``differences of opinion'' with McCain during the
three-candidate debate. But Bush's aides predicted the governor
would roll out new allegations, in keeping with his recent pattern
of accusing McCain of a different inconsistency each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see Governor Bush outline very clearly the
differences between what Chairman McCain says and what he does,''
Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, said of the debate
strategy. ``I think it will be new to the audience on television.''
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Bush's line of attack, McCain told reporters
aboard his campaign bus that it might be possible ``for 200
staffers'' parsing the record to ``find contradictions'' in his
votes. ``You obviously rethink your position on some things,'' he
said. ``To have total rigidity in a position over 17 years in
Congress would be foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush and Alan Keyes are scheduled to square off at 9
p.m. in a 90-minute debate hosted by CNN's Larry King. The format
is expected to be less formal, and, given the host, more
freewheeling, than the previous GOP debates, with some 400 local
business leaders and residents and 300 reporters in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sponsored by the South Carolina Business and
Industrial Political Education Committee, or BIPEC, will allow
candidates ample time to question each other, a spokeswoman said.
Given the contentiousness of the GOP campaign in recent weeks, as
McCain and Bush have sparred via the media from separate cities,
several campaign aides said they expected the debate to be heated,
if not bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said Monday neither he nor Bush could afford an
escalation in hostilities. ``There's too much at stake here,'' he
said at a crowded American Legion post in Greenwood. Last Friday,
McCain pulled two of his TV advertisements, saying the negativity
in the race had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also continued to say he was being maligned by his
opponent, a tactic Bush also uses.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent McCain supporter, Representative Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina, told a crowd the Bush campaign is ``trying to take
our good man and paint him something he ain't.'' And McCain
repeatedly portrayed himself as a victim of the Bush attack. ``Our
politics should not be about savaging each other,'' McCain said.
``This negativism has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last Monday, Bush has described almost every day what he
calls inconsistencies in McCain's platform and legislative record.
In addition to saying McCain's campaign finance reform proposal
would harm the Republican Party, Bush has criticized McCain for
taking campaign money from lobbyists, riding on corporate jets and,
Monday, for voting five times for the public financing of
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   McCain now opposes such public funding, and said those earlier
votes were the sort of compromises that constitute ``the essence of
legislating.'' He suggested Bush's attempts to portray them as
anything else were insincere. And McCain complained: ``This kind of
savagery is not necessary in an American political campaign.''
McCain, saying he would ``not let the perfect be the enemy of the
good,'' described his votes as necessary to reach a campaign
finance compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ridiculed McCain's use of the word ``savagery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for us in the Republican Party to
understand, our candidate is going to have to withstand a savaging
attack if Al Gore is the nominee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain succeeds in derailing Bush again in South Carolina,
the senator's momentum could wither the Texas governor image as a
winner. Bush entered the campaign with a $70 million treasury and
the support of much of the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The next primaries will be Feb. 22 in Michigan and Arizona,
McCain's home state. The potential impact of South Carolina's
results was described by Sage Eastman, spokesman for the Republican
Party in Michigan. ``Clearly, if John McCain wins in South
Carolina, if he wins the debate, a lot of people are expecting it
to snowball as it heads into Michigan,'' Eastman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's South Carolina communications director, Tucker Eskew,
said the debate ``will give us a chance to show George W. Bush's
personality, his command of the issues and his record of getting
results. People are talking. The buzz is very good. We want the
debate to continue that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two men also sparred over McCain's efforts to
draw support from Democrats and Independents, who are free to vote
in South Carolina's open primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are welcome to come into the party, that's fine with
me,'' Bush said. ``I just don't want Democrats coming in to vote
against me because they think my opponent will be easier to beat in
November. We're trying to get rid of the Clinton era, not reinforce
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended his efforts to reach out to new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll reach across the partisan aisle and extend a hand to
Democrats,'' he said. ``The American people are weary of us
constantly, constantly fighting with one another and getting
gridlock and never getting anything done.''

 SAO PAULO, Brazil: are not.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared with the several hundred people in the city who are
able to commute by helicopter, about 3.7 million residents resort
to the city's precarious bus system each day, according to
municipal figures. Because riding the city's 10,400 buses is often
dangerous and uncomfortable, unlicensed minivans have grown popular
as a way to get around.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, three people were killed and eight injured
when a minivan driver fled from the police and hit a tree; one
newspaper said in a front-page editorial, ``No one controls the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   While travel on the ground remains quite dangerous, there have
been few accidents involving helicopters in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Wilheim said Sao Paulo would need to extend its subway lines by
six miles each year in the next decade for the public
transportation system to approach those of Paris or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is little impetus from the authorities to make such
plans when spending is restricted. A result of Sao Paulo's
lackadaisical approach to public transportation is a general
assault on the ears of residents.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the city, the honking horns of bottlenecks and
sirens of police vehicles weaving through traffic is joined by the
almost incessant sound of helicopters whizzing by. The Sao Paulo
Helicopter Pilots Association says about 100 helicopters fly above
the city at any given time during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand helicopters,'' said Paula Doria, a 21-year-old
student, ``because I live next to an apartment building with a
heliport, and the noise is incredible.'' Still, she said, ``If I
had enough money to buy a helicopter I would, because it's a way to
escape from crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the helicopter traffic is an added feature that can
make some of Sao Paulo's more crowded districts, already adorned
with huge television advertising screens and multilingual
billboards, resemble a scene from ``Blade Runner,'' the 1982 movie
about a rain-soaked, futuristic Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a wealthy elite seeks private-sector solutions for its
problems in ``Blade Runner,'' Sao Paulo's powerful are increasingly
turning to private companies for services normally in the public
sphere, like security, education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   James Thurston Lynch, a former banker at Chase Manhattan,
understands this well. Lynch, a Brazilian who now has his own
investment firm, plans to buy 100 helicopters for a part-ownership
program similar to the system that people use to share private jets
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who intends to sign up 1,000 people to buy shares in his
fleet, said, ``I hope to democratize use of the helicopter.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: TAKEOUT ORDER _ BUCKET O' BACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Teldec company hasn't offered to send me its recorded
collection of Johann Sebastian Bach's music complete, but if it
does, I have a gracious letter of refusal ready. Never mind when I
would listen to it; where would I put it?
</P>
<P>
   Think of the expanse: 153 compact discs released in 12 volumes,
71 CDs of the sacred cantatas alone, 35 more for organ and other
keyboard pieces. Volume 7 has motets, songs and 371 chorales.
According to my crude powers of calculation ``Bach 2000,'' as this
project is trademarked, competes with Genesis: a creation-making
seven days of listening and no seventh day of rest. No time out for
naps or bathroom breaks either.
</P>
<P>
   If each plastic jewel box measures 3/8 inch in thickness, allow
for almost 2 yards of music. Eleven hundred ninety-nine dollars and
97 cents, please. A less caloric package, minus the cantatas
(described by one representative of the company as ``Bach Light''),
will cost you $849.97.
</P>
<P>
   Teldec has let loose an avalanche of greatness that few of us
are ready to dig our way out of. Having these items assembled on
the shelf is a comfort, I suppose. To get them that far, the record
company has thoughtfully arranged Bach complete into a musical
suitcase, equipped with handle for carrying. Music enters the 21st
century with luggage in its hand.
</P>
<P>
   Once the contents are home and in place, all cultural bases will
be covered. Sudden world shortages of ``Actus Tragicus''? Some
unforeseen market run on the ``Coffee Cantata''? All of Bach will
be there waiting for us, like the canned goods we prudently stocked
in our backyard bomb shelter.
</P>
<P>
   There is the pride of ownership, but this is a nettlesome
problem in music. We can show friends a good piece of Wedgwood or
Rose Medallion china, buoyed not only by its beauty but by knowing
it belongs to us and not them. We can pick it up, feel its surface
and know it is downstairs on the sideboard when we go to bed at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Music is hard to own. It's out there in the ether. The
collector's thrill of possession has been taken away. Composers own
the performance rights (for a while); performers own some of the
profits from record sales. But how do we collect the Bartok Fourth
String Quartet? I count 10 versions of it now in print. We can buy
a copy, but then so can everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   There is even the minute possibility that we could own the
original manuscript, but a printed score available in any reputable
music store will (or should) give us the same messages and is
probably easier to read.
</P>
<P>
   I still have the first long-playing record I ever bought: Book
I, Volume 1 of Wanda Landowska playing ``The Well-Tempered
Clavier'' (RCA Victor LM1017). Maybe an antiques dealer would
admire the patina on that old cardboard cover. As to the vinyl
surface, ``scratched'' might translate into ``charmingly
distressed.'' I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I can hear the identical performance spruced up and
available on compact disc and sounding better than it did before.
The only thing to collect is the cardboard and the vinyl, and
neither is music.
</P>
<P>
   One calming thought: Bach complete on one shelf is the
equivalent of an Encyclopedia Britannica or another New Grove
Dictionary spinoff. It is there with what we want, if and when we
need it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sensation is not the same. An encyclopedia or
dictionary is dormant. Both are built to be passive. They wait
patiently to be paid attention to. A recording has a latent energy.
It sits on the shelf wanting to be heard; thumbing past it leaves
us with a twinge of guilt: ``Shouldn't we be taking the `Musical
Offering' for a walk now and then?''
</P>
<P>
   The principal trauma in receiving Bach 2000 and the reason I
graciously demur from having it in my house (although the Teldec
people still haven't offered) is the suddenness. It is having so
much, so fast, with such brutal simultaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have the dubious advantage of receiving CDs in the mail;
they come unbidden and often in volume. When I was young and poor
and eager for musical information, each purchase _ one a week with
every paycheck _ was a new wonder, a treasure to be examined and
re-examined. Having one Bach record made me listen over and over.
Having 153 is so intimidating, so engulfing, I might not listen at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Teldec, to be fair, doesn't expect many customers to be walking
out of record stores suitcase in hand. But that depends perhaps on
how many of Wall Street's current bonus babies are interested in
Bach. Twelve hundred dollars, after all, will buy them a couple of
nights at a good Paris hotel, or three or four made-to-order
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Bach 2000 will be coming at you in waves: first, five volumes of
cantatas (four with 15 CDs each); then Volumes 6 and 7 (Passions,
Masses, motets, chorales and the Magnificat: about 22 CDs); at high
tide, expect the organ and other keyboard works (Volumes 8, 9 and
10). The waters will ebb with chamber and concerto pieces. The
items will also trickle individually. Some of these recordings are
new; many are old releases recycled.
</P>
<P>
   The performers and performing groups (Thomas Hampson and Barbara
Bonney are exceptions) represent a firmament of historically
informed music making. Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the archangel of early
music, hovers over Bach 2000. Gustav Leonhardt and Ton Koopman are
scarcely less blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on the rosters do I find Leopold Stokowski and his
marvelously Technicolored big-band transcriptions. There is no
Bach-Busoni or Bach-Liszt, no ``Switched-On'' Bach, no Jacques
Loussier giving the Inventions a boogie beat.
</P>
<P>
   Teldec gives us the composer from one point of view: the closest
approximation possible to the instruments Bach heard and how they
were used by him and his colleagues in the first half of the 18th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is powerful and powerfully argued, and Bach 2000 is
entitled to it. But as we make our way through the 250th
anniversary of his death, we should not forget that Bach belongs to
all of us; researchers into the long ago are not necessarily his
exclusive agents.
</P>
<P>
   It is sometimes said that any literary epoch of the last 400
years can be precisely described by a reading of its Shakespeare
criticism. Our interpretations of the plays seem to change
drastically according to who we are and when. Maybe Bach, like
Shakespeare, is another of the proverbial mirrors we can hold up to
ourselves. He is not back there. He is about us.

<P>
   Early in her memoir on living with diabetes, Lisa Roney
describes a hike through the Great Smoky Mountains and her
frustrating inability to keep pace with her group. Elevated blood
sugar, probably from eating too much gorp, was making her lethargic
and confused, and she had to keep sitting down to rest along the
narrow trail.
</P>
<P>
   Only her best friend's older brother had the decency to hang
back and ease her along, and the rest of the group teased her over
his attention. But humiliating as their taunts were, Roney recalls,
it was better to be seen as manipulative than medically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a male could rescue me the situation seemed outwardly
almost normal, as though I were simply a weak female, not a sick
person,'' she writes in her first book, ``Sweet Invisible Body:
Reflections on a Life With Diabetes'' (Henry Holt &AMP; Co.).
</P>
<P>
   When Roney was 11, she learned she had diabetes, the most
serious form in which the pancreas fails to produce any of the
hormone needed to process sugar. Now 39, Roney has been giving
herself daily glucose tests and insulin injections for nearly three
decades. Though she is ostensibly healthy, blindness, heart disease
and life-threatening infection are among the potential
complications she faces as a diabetic woman.
</P>
<P>
   She has not always been careful. A heavy dose of denial meant
that for years, she avoided checkups, indulged in eating binges and
juggled three jobs at once.
</P>
<P>
   And she was not alone in slighting her disease. Doctors plied
her with platitudes. Even close friends were insensitive, showing
up late for lunch dates when irregular meals can wreak havoc with a
diabetic person's blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Now pursuing a doctorate in American literature at Pennsylvania
State University, Roney said she began her book after deciding that
society had denied diabetes its stature as a serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I tried to learn to understand myself, it was natural for
me to look to books and there was not much out there,'' Roney, who
grew up in Tennessee, said recently in a telephone interview. ``All
kinds of other ailments have figured in literature and cultural
studies. But for some reason, diabetes was not included.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, there is now a handful of diabetes memoirs
that suggests a similar awakening in others. Last August, when Holt
released Roney's book, W.W. Norton &AMP; Co. published ``Showdown With
Diabetes,'' by Deb Butterfield, an account of her successful
pancreas transplant and her anger over what she sees as the
traditional view that diabetes should be managed rather than cured.
In 1998, Scribner came out with ``Needles: A Memoir of Growing Up
With Diabetes,'' in which Andie Dominick describes her complicated
relationship with her older sister _ both siblings were found to
have diabetes as children _ and the reckless behavior, including
drug abuse, that contributed to her sister's death.
</P>
<P>
   All three authors, whose cases were diagnosed as juvenile, or
Type 1, diabetes, address the burden of having a potentially fatal
condition they say they were expected to keep under wraps. All
three recall growing up in an era of excess _ of drugs, sex and
gourmet food _ and having to restrain themselves. And all three
memoirs detail how relentless diabetes management is.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield became so adept at taking her insulin shots amid the
demands of her former Wall Street career as an executive recruiter
that she would inject herself under her desk, through her clothes.
If blood started seeping through her blouse, she simply put on her
blazer to conceal it. Today, no longer dependent on insulin because
of a pancreas transplant, she advocates wider use of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been portrayed as a manageable disease _ that if people
take insulin, if they follow their diet and if they follow all
their regulations and restrictions, everything will be fine,'' said
Butterfield, who is 40 and now lives in St. Louis and New York.
``Therefore the implication is, if things go wrong, it's because
the person who had diabetes did something wrong. It's the disease
that's the problem, not the person.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional toll of living with chronic disease may partly
account for the flurry of memoirs, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn,
president of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, a research and
treatment center. But Kahn said that only 5 percent to 10 percent
of the nation's 16 million diabetics have the extreme,
insulin-dependent condition described in the books. Most people
have Type 2 diabetes, the adult-onset form that is often milder and
can be managed by diet and medication. In addition, Kahn said,
pancreas transplants are still difficult procedures performed on
less than 1 percent of diabetes patients. For now, he said, a
controlled diet and medication remain the best way for most
diabetes patients.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kahn agrees that diabetes has not gotten its due. About
two years ago, he led a committee asked by Congress to look at the
state of diabetes research. The resulting 145-page report urged
huge increases in financing, from the current $430 million a year
to, eventually, $1.6 billion a year. If that figure seems high,
Kahn said, it represents only 1 percent of the annual cost to the
nation for diabetes health care.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations, of
blindness in working-age adults, and of dialysis, he said.
Moreover, Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes has grown nearly sixfold
over the last 40 years, because of the nation's aging population
and sedentary lifestyle. ``People don't realize how much impact it
has on patients and the health of the nation as a whole,'' Kahn
said. ``It doesn't get the same respect as other diseases where the
impact is more acutely dramatic, where people die very quickly.
With diabetes, it's a very slow and complex process and takes many
years for the complications to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three authors, Butterfield suffered the most
complications, including kidney damage and a heart attack, before
receiving her successful transplant six years ago. Her memoir
recounts them all, including the alarming discovery of neuropathy,
or death of the nerves, in her feet and lower legs.
</P>
<P>
   A diabetic since age 9, Butterfield walked out of one shoe one
morning as she left her apartment and did not feel it. The stares
of pedestrians prompted her to look down and, to her horror, see
she was standing on one bare foot. The next day, she forced herself
to buy a cane and practiced holding it in front of her mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how I looked at myself,'' Butterfield wrote, ``I
looked crippled. After 19 years of hiding my diabetes, my life as
an undercover diabetic was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominick, a 28-year-old English teacher at Iowa State University
at Ames, also received a diabetes diagnosis at 9 and developed
severe retinopathy, or eye disease, after 15 years of diabetes had
weakened the blood vessels behind her eyes and caused them to
hemorrhage. To repair her failing vision, she has had seven laser
surgeries and a major operation in which the blood-filled gel
behind the eye lens was sucked out and replaced with saline
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the 1993 death of her older sister Denise that
prompted her to begin her book, Dominick said in an interview. The
pair shared a deep connection despite the 12-year age difference,
from the matching color of their hair and eyes to a birthmark on
their abdomens. Dominick so idolized Denise that she would play
with her discarded needles.
</P>
<P>
   When Dominick's diabetes was diagnosed as well, Denise became
even more fiercely protective. The two sisters were living together
in Des Moines, Iowa, when Denise died from a combination of
diabetes-related heart disease and chronic cocaine abuse, said
Dominick, who found the body. Dominick wrote that in her grief, she
recognized that her sister had been self-destructive because of a
subconscious desire to take her own life before diabetes did.
</P>
<P>
   Roney also describes a constant awareness of mortality that
begins the moment she wakes up and follows her in her sleep. Even
today, she gets a daily, long-distance wake-up call from her mother
to make sure she has not slipped into a low-blood-sugar coma
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, even though I adore sleeping,'' Roney writes, ``I
usually do so only tentatively, skimming on the surface out of fear
of not waking again...I try to remain aware of myself while I sleep
because it is then, during the stillness of eight or seven or six
hours' slumber, that my body is most vulnerable to these hideous
lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though my doctor reassures me that, aside from situations
related to alcohol and automobiles, few people actually die of
hypoglycemia...these episodes shame and haunt me, the most apparent
shadow on my semblance of a normal life.''

INSPECTION REVEALS 23 JETS WITH TAIL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An urgent weekend inspection of more than 1,000 airplanes with
the same tail design as the Alaska Airlines MD-80 which crashed off
California two weeks ago has found at least 23 airplanes had some
problem with the mechanism which moves the stabilizer, the Federal
Aviation Administration said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In at least 13 cases, the mechanism _ which drives the
horizontal stablizer up and down in order to control the pitch of
the plane's nose _ was replaced, according to the FAA. In another
six cases, lubricant was added to the jackscrew which moves the
stabilizer and limits its movement in any one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said airlines had until Wednesday to report what
corrective action was needed, and another week to report if no
action was taken, so the number of affected airplanes could
increase, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew has been the focus of much attention of federal
accident investigators since the the two-foot-long shaft was
recovered Feb. 8 from the crash site of Alaska Airlines Flight 261
in the Pacific Ocean. The jackscrew was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board disclosed Sunday night
that the Alaska Airlines plane that crashed Jan. 31 killing all 88
on board underwent a heavy maintenance check on Sept. 29, 1997. At
that time, mechanics found the mechanism _ known as the jackscrew
and gimbal nut assembly _ was worn and written up to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to replace the gimbal nut came after mechanics
performed a test known as an ``end-play check.'' That test revealed
the gimbal nut had ``maximum allowable end play limit'' according
to the plane's maintenance records. In other words, the nut was
close to failing to meet its specifications.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB chairman James Hall said that decision was reviewed the
next day, Sept. 30, and the maintenance record indicates that the
system ``fell within the specified tolerances. The record further
reflected that it was rechecked five times with the same result.
The entry also indicated that these results were signed off by an
Alaska Airlines maintenance inspector.''
</P>
<P>
   One long-time aviation maintenance specialist who spoke on
condition of anonymity said if the inspector was a supervisor
overriding the concerns of a mechanic, it could indicate that the
airline was trying to to get the plane back in service quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The specialist said that if there were concerns about the part,
it would either be replaced, or written up to be put on an
accelerated watch, so that mechanics would have to check it again
within a certain number of flight hours. It is not clear whether
that was done, or if the inspector was a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines officials did not return a telephone call and
the NTSB had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said Monday that the visual inspection ordered on Friday
of all MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 jackscrew assemblies be
finished by midday Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,103 affected aircraft, jackscrews were replaced on at
least 13 planes: four on Alaskan Airlines planes, three on AirTran
planes, two on Hawaiian, and one each on Continental, Delta,
Northwest, and TWA.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the industry
trade association, said the repairs may have resulted in a few
sporadic cancellations of flights, but expected any inconvenience
to be minor.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA emergency order to inspect the mechanisms also
accelerates the timetable _ from every eight months to every 650
flight hours _ for re-inspecting the jackscrew assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The maintenance specialist said that the mechanism which moves
the horizontal stablizer on other types of aircraft is similar in
design to that on the MD-80 family of airplanes. However, FAA
spokesman Paul Takemoto said the agency had no plans to expand its
order to other types of aircraft.

REVEAL NEEDS TO INSECURE MANAGER

By KEN LLOYD  
 c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: At a meeting with our manager and two
members of senior management, our manager answered a question but
was not very clear. When one of the senior managers asked several
of us for elaboration, I provided it. Afterward, my manager said
thanks for making him look bad. Now he is very aloof. What can I
do? W.T.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Your manager just as easily could have thanked you for
making him look good. After all, you are a member of his team, and
it is widely believed that strong managers hire strong employees.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this issue obviously depends on the way you elaborated
on his answer. For example, if you opened by implying your manager
is some sort of a dim bulb, then his reaction is not altogether
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely case is that your manager is feeling insecure
and may sense you are going to leap over him. The problem in this
scenario is that he may consciously or unconsciously try to place
you in situations in which your goals, needs and motivations are
not being met, and in which you ultimately fail.
</P>
<P>
   You should meet with your manager and tell him you sense a drop
in communication with him lately, and then let him talk. If he is
upset with your comments at the meeting, emphasize the fact you
simply provided information on a question from senior management.
Neither he nor the department would look better if all of you had
sat there and stared blankly at the senior manager. As for the
future, if he expects you and your staff to ``dumb down'' in these
types of situations, then it may be downright dumb to remain in
this department.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager just told me I'm too friendly with the employees I
supervise. I am a friendly manager, but I don't think I've crossed
the line, and that's exactly what I told him. He insisted I be more
cautious about this, but I don't know what to do. A.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your manager has given you some friendly advice, but it
sounds like a value judgment, and that is not of much value. On the
one hand, your manager is correct in implying that supervisory
personnel need to be careful about becoming overly friendly with
their staff. At the same time, if he is going to apply this generic
statement to you, he should substantiate it with some facts.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your manager you have thought carefully about what he said
and you are going to keep his comments in mind. Then tell him you
would like more help and guidance on this matter. Ask him for some
examples of situations where you were too friendly, as well as for
some suggestions as to the way he thinks you should act in such
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Employees prefer managers who are supportive, knowledgeable,
accessible, and communicative, and this implies employees prefer
managers who are friendly. You should continue to maintain a
friendly relationship with your staff, while trying to view
yourself as a manager who is friendly as opposed to a friend who is
managing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After almost nine years at a job I really enjoyed, I made a
decision to leave. The reason is my supervisor. I don't know why
she didn't like me and emotionally abused me, as I was praised for
my work by other departments. I spoke to the personnel director,
who then told my supervisor about everything we had discussed in
confidence. I need closure on this. Can you help? L.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: After tolerating an abusive supervisor and a reckless
personnel director for an extended period, it is not surprising
that you decided to leave. It also is not surprising you seek some
closure on this experience. One step that will help is to find a
job that is far more rewarding, energizing and equitable. However,
you should not dive into the labor pool without having a new job
lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Once employed in the right position, you will spend more time
thinking about new projects, activities and objectives, and less
time on the problems you encountered in your last job. This will
help carry you down the road to closure.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, closure is going to come from within you. You need
to decide to close the previous chapter of your work life. One
technique that can help is to sit down and express all of your
thoughts about your last work experience in writing, just like a
letter. You do not need to mail it to anyone, as the therapeutic
value will come from the writing itself. When you reach the final
words to close the letter, you should also reach the closure you
seek.

&HT;     BUSH AND MCCAIN IN CLOSE S.C. RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWOOD, S.C. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
entered the home stretch of their increasingly bitter battle for
South Carolina's nominating delegates Monday with polls pointing to
a close vote in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   The tight race put the spotlight on independent voters and
Democrats who can vote in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   `At this point, I think it will be very close,'' said Harvey
Bell, Republican co-chair of Saluda County. The prospect of
independent and Democratic voters participating `doesn't sit well
with me,'' said Bell. `I hope it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's prediction of a close contest was borne out by late
polls.
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles Time poll of likely voters in the South
Carolina released Monday Bush had 42 percent and McCain had 40
percent, a dead heat. A Newsweek poll released over the weekend had
Bush leading McCain 43 percent to 40 percent in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by Rasmussen Associates showed the importance of
independent and Democratic voters in the Republican primary here.
</P>
<P>
   Among South Carolina Republicans, Bush leads by 19 percentage
points, according to the poll. However, among independents and
Democrats, McCain leads by a whopping 74-percent-to-18-percent
margin.
</P>
<P>
   By that calculus, a larger-than-average turnout among
independents and Democrats could throw the primary to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to capitalize on his experience as a two-term
governor of Texas, telling an admiring crowd that McCain had
`served his country well'' as a Navy flier and POW in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This party needs somebody who can lead a proven leader with a
record of reform,'' Bush said. He asked for the support of `tire
kickers'' _ undecideds who had turned out to hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm in a hard contest here,'' Bush said. Nevertheless, when
asked what he would do if he lost in South Carolina, Bush responded
confidently: `I'm not going to lose here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters acknowledged that if independents and Democrats
turn out in large numbers, Bush could leave South Carolina a loser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was put on the defensive when Bush's campaign aides
accused him for favoring government-financed elections for members
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said that he opposes taxpayer financed federal
elections but has supported similar provisions in the past as part
of legislative compromises to reform the system. McCain said he
voted 11 times against public financing of federal elections. But
he said he might have voted for some measures that contained
provisions for public financing of federal campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather have something that may have some public
financing in it than the present system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing frustration at the cross-state debate, McCain said:
``This kind of savagery is not necessary in an American political
campaign,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Miles away, Bush replied, `That's not savagery. That's what we
call full exposure, full disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also responded to criticism from the National Rifle
Association that he had dropped his opposition to trigger locks on
handguns after a series of killings at the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids go to school and start killing other kids, obviously
sometimes you rethink your position,'' McCain explained.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that he _ and not McCain _ could attract enough
conservative Democrats and independents to beat either of the
Democratic contenders in November.
</P>
<P>
   For a Republican to draw Democrats and independents, `there must
be a clear philosophical difference'' between the Republican and
Democratic nominees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to reporters after a rally here in the
southwestern portion of the state, the home region of James Bonham
and William Travis _ heroes of the Alamo and major figures in Texas
history, cited former President Reagan's success against former
Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, voters had a clear choice between Reagan's
advocacy of lower taxes and less government and Mondale's statement
that he would raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   `There must be a clear philosophical difference,'' Bush said.
`There's no difference between McCain and (Vice President Al)
Gore'' on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is targeting conservative Democrats and
independents with mail and phone calls as part of its effort to
reach as many as 400,000 voters in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he was not tailoring his message to those voters.
`I don't change my pitch,'' he said. `My pitch is give me a chance,
I can lead the country to a better tomorrow. My pitch is if you're
sick of Washington, give me a chance to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that it is `hard for me to quantify
enthusiasm'' of voters in South Carolina, Bush said. `I thought I
was doing well in New Hampshire.''

AUSTRIA UNDER SIEGE BY ARTISTS _ AND ARTIFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Thanks to Joerg Haider's Freedom Party, Vienna
has two new schools of art: the small and bitter Get-Out-Now
movement and the larger, angrier Stay-and-Fight club.
</P>
<P>
   The first wants a complete art blockade of Austria to protest
the inclusion of Haider's right-wing anti-immigrant party in a
coalition government. The latter plans to stay and protest his
ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   For once, artists are siding with the power elite. Although he
is a partner in a government with a typical conservative platform,
Haider earlier made statements _ especially those seen as
sympathetic to the Third Reich _ that so upset the European Union
that 14 countries have downgraded diplomatic relations with
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   However feared he is by liberals, it's not clear that Haider
poses any threat to the arts. Although artists here are even more
careless than politicians about tossing off blithe references to
Nazism, no one in the public debate yet suggests that Haider's
party would crack down on anyone he disliked _ or even cut the
generous government subsidies that Austria gives artists. And there
has been nearly as much snide slicing of rivals as there is bashing
of Haider's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Gerard Mortier, the artistic director of the
celebrated Salzburg Festival. Last week while traveling in the
United States, he made headlines by announcing that he would resign
early to protest the presence of Haider's party in the government.
</P>
<P>
   But as was known to everyone in Vienna who has followed
Mortier's angry clashes with Austria's conservative president,
Thomas Klestil, over the festival's avant-garde spin, he announced
last March that he would depart in 2001, and his replacement was
named two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, speaking at a public forum called ``Go or Stay: Is
Artistic Freedom Endangered?,'' the actor Klaus Maria Brandauer
dismissed Mortier's beau geste: ``I spoke to a French woman who
said, `Everybody should take the stand Mortier did.' She didn't
know he was leaving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's forum, word reached Austria that Mortier had gone
even further. In an interview with a Dutch magazine, he said he
feared Haider would turn the Salzburg Festival into a mix of
``Strauss waltzes and a yodeling contest.'' He also called for a
boycott of the annual New Year's concert by the Vienna
Philharmonic. Since it is televised worldwide, that would ``cost
Austria millions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the magazine reported, Mortier also made a threat inimical
to artistic freedom: If Nikolaus Harnoncourt, who has been invited
to direct the New Year's concert, accepts, he will drop him from
this year's Salzburg program.
</P>
<P>
   Rainhard Fendrich, author of the pop video hit ``I Am From
Austria,'' which celebrates the beer-and-Alpine-scenery culture, is
now so ashamed of being Austrian, the magazine Profil said this
week, that ``he is in Majorca and prefers to speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   More respectfully discussed at the forum, which packed the Burg
Theater on Monday, was the decision by Elfriede Jelinek, one of
Austria's best-known playwrights, to refuse to let her works be
performed in Austria while Haider is in the government. Jelinek was
to speak, but sent word that she was sick, although she is also
known to be very shy. An actor read her statement, which included
the explanation: ``My words will have an effect in that they won't
be heard anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview Jelinek said she would leave Austria if
she didn't have to care for her aged mother. Her words have a
certain influence because she is one of the few artists to have
been directly attacked by Haider's party. Two years ago a Freedom
Party poster in the campaign for the Vienna government read: ``Do
You Want Jelinek, Turrini and Peymann, or Do You Want Art?''
</P>
<P>
   The three are modern writers and directors of works that upset
Austrian nationalists. Jelinek's long, cerebral plays attack the
materialistic, health-obsessed ``body culture'' that some see as an
allusion to the tanned, narcissistic Haider and his yuppie
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Peymann staged a production of Thomas Bernhard's
``Heldenplatz,'' much of which was a monologue by an elderly Jew
describing Austria's acceptance of Hitler and included the line
``all Austrians are Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the director Andrea Breth, who was, in Jelinek's absence,
the only woman on stage at Monday's forum, said she thought
Jelinek's decision was ``exactly the wrong way to go about
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking one could fight a government with silence was ``a bit
vain,'' she concluded. She said she supported Luc Bondy, the
well-known Swiss-German director sitting next to her, in his
position: ``Come to Austria and speak out, speak out, speak out!''

<P>
   Reaction from outside Austria is still muted and
individualistic, partially because Vienna is no longer the world
cultural capital it once was. Some French painters have said they
will not show here. On Sunday Lou Reed canceled the Vienna leg of
his European tour, telling Austrian radio, ``People have the right
to elect someone like him, but that doesn't mean everyone has to
get close to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubin Mehta, director of the Israel Philharmonic, has
effectively ignored the Israeli government, which has recalled its
ambassador to Vienna in protest. He said he would gauge the new
government's acts before refusing to work here.
</P>
<P>
   Last week there was talk of the Oscar committee's canceling the
eligibility of an Austrian entry, ``Nordrand'' (``North Skirts'')
for best foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   That saddened some who knew the film, directed by Barbara
Albert, because its message is anti-xenophobic. It follows a young
woman from a troubled, hate-filled lower-class Austrian family who
is befriended and redeemed by a young Bosnian refugee woman living
here _ exactly the kind of people Haider attacks. In the end, the
committee decided to leave the film in the running.
</P>
<P>
   Artists oppose the Freedom Party largely because of its stance
on immigrants and race. Fairly characterizing its attitude toward
art is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marboe, Vienna's cultural affairs counselor, said he had a
``really horrendous'' experience with Haider followers over a
retrospective of the art of the Wienergruppe (Vienna Group), which
was popular 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, he said, was a pioneering piece that he said
attacked silence about child abuse and included pictures of naked
children and erect penises. When he refused to remove it, he said,
the Freedom Party group accused him of backing child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The party ``is erratic'' about styles, he said, and picks fights
it thinks will win it votes. On the other hand, it simply ignored a
Vienna musical that nastily satirized Haider, ``1000 Suns, or Dr.
Jockel in Power,'' even though it was staged with city money during
the recent election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The party doesn't denounce huge state subsidies for opera as
elitist, as populist parties elsewhere might. It favors classical
and folk art but backed the Austrian Cultural Institute in New
York, a sliver of a building whose architect likened it to a
guillotine. It voted against a Vienna Holocaust memorial and
against raising a museum to house the papers of Arnold Schoenberg
but did not give an anti-Semitic reason, though their opponents
suggested there was one.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at the forum, the novelist Robert Menasse denounced
the Freedom Party the way nearly everyone else did _ but he said
its appearance had been a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, he said, Austrians had been too complacent about
the cozy power-sharing between the two big parties that dominated
their politics. ``Not long ago,'' he said, ``it would have been
unthinkable to have a full house in this theater on a Sunday
morning for a political discussion.''

`CITY OF GOD': TAKING READERS INSIDE THE WRITER'S IDEA NOTEBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through ``City of God,'' E.L. Doctorow's fractured,
fragmentary new novel, a character observes that ``as a writer, I
am only fascinated by the power of this hodgepodge of chronicles,
verses, songs, relationships, laws of the universe, sins, and days
of reckonings'' _ a ``scissors-and-paste job'' that is ``terse,
inconsistent, defiant of common sense, and cryptically inattentive
to the ordinary demands of narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   While Doctorow means for this description to apply,
flatteringly, to the Bible, it might just as well apply, in far
more pejorative terms, to the author's own self-important novel.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, which takes its title from St. Augustine's classic
text, purports to be the journal of a writer named Everett. It is
filled with ideas for stories and movies, chapters of a novel,
transcripts of interviews, poems, song fragments and seemingly
random musings on everything from physics to metaphysics, the
feeding habits of birds to the spiritual life of Ludwig
Wittgenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these passages have enormous flash and dazzle: they
attest to Doctorow's virtuosic talents as a writer. Other bits are
emotionally engrossing, immersing us in such disparate worlds as a
Jewish ghetto during World War II and the Allied trenches of World
War I. The power of these sections, however, is deliberately
undercut by other passages that self-consciously call attention to
Doctorow's narrative method. The result is an oddly stilted novel
that tries to substitute pretension for ambition, avant-garde
gestures for a genuine authorial vision.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant story in ``City of God'' concerns the maverick
rector of a small New York City church, a man by the name of Thomas
Pemberton who is in the throes of a spiritual crisis, trying to
reconcile the myriad evils of the world with the existence of God.
When the crucifix from Pemberton's church is stolen and
mysteriously resurfaces on the roof of an uptown synagogue,
Pemberton takes the act of vandalism as a sign whose meaning he
must decipher. In the meantime he befriends the two rabbis of the
synagogue, a married couple named Joshua Gruen and Sarah
Blumenthal. After Joshua suddenly dies, the victim of a vicious
assault, Pemberton begins courting his widow and contemplates a
conversion to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   As Doctorow tells it there are two Pembertons, two Joshuas and
two Sarahs: the ones who exist in real life and who have been
interviewed by Everett, and their fictionalized counterparts who
exist in the pages of Everett's novel-in-progress. The point of
these doppelgangers is to underscore two favorite Doctorow themes,
namely the interpenetration of fact and fiction (embodied most
successfully in his 1975 novel, ``Ragtime''), and the mechanics of
storytelling (embodied most prominently heretofore in his 1984
book, ``Lives of the Poets'').
</P>
<P>
   The ordering impulse of storytelling, in fact, is the main
leitmotif in this musically structured novel. In one way or another
nearly all of Everett's journal entries concern the importance of
narrative in our lives. Physics, Doctorow suggests, is a kind of
storytelling, providing an explanation for the physical workings of
the cosmos, just as various religions lay out different stories
meant to explain the moral underpinnings of the world. God can be
seen as the greatest of all narrators, conjuring the world into
being and presiding over it from afar; or He can be seen as the
ultimate creation of the writers of the Bible, intent on turning
``the human condition into a sequential narrative of how it came to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biblical stories, the Gospel stories, were the original
understandings,'' Pemberton declares, ``they were science and
religion, they were everything, they were all anyone had. But they
didn't write themselves. We have to acknowledge the storytellers'
work.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of the stories in Everett's journal are highly
compelling _ including one documenting the struggles of Sarah's
father and other Jews to survive the barbarities of the Nazi
occupation of their city _ the reader's attention is continually
distracted by Everett's weaker efforts. These lesser tales are just
the sort of trial balloons that writers jot down in their journals
and later, for good reason, put aside: a ludicrous treatment for a
movie about a man who plots to assume the identity of his mistress'
wealthy husband; another equally unbelievable story about a former
reporter who becomes an avenging angel of death. No doubt these
lesser stories are meant to illustrate the notion that weak
narratives, like strong ones, represent the human rage for closure,
our desire to force the messy ingredients of life into some sort of
order.
</P>
<P>
   What is ironic about ``City of God'' is that a book that
ostensibly celebrates storytelling should so willfully eschew
linearity and old-fashioned narrative itself. Doctorow, of course,
has used experimental techniques to impressive effect in earlier
books: ``The Book of Daniel'' used a highly elliptical narrative to
tell the story of the Rosenbergs (or a couple much like the
Rosenbergs) from their son's point of view, and ``Lives of the
Poets'' gave us the portrait of a writer refracted through the
fictions he's created.
</P>
<P>
   While the premise of having this novel take the form of a
writer's journal may seem similar to that of ``Lives of the
Poets,'' while Pemberton's struggles to find an authentic faith
recall the struggles of that earlier book's hero to find an
authentic mode of living, the two books differ enormously in
effect. ``City of God'' sorely lacks the neatly interlocking puzzle
pieces of ``Poets,'' _ the emotional through-line and organic sense
of coherence that lay beneath its innovative structure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, in fact, ``City of God'' bears more of a resemblance
to a different Doctorow novel, ``Loon Lake'' (1980) _ another
pretentious and abstract novel that for all its flashes of
brilliance remains little more than a ``scissors-and-paste job,'' a
novel of ideas that may be packed with ideas but that fails as a
satisfying work of fiction.

AOL HALTS LOBBYING FOR CABLE BROADBAND LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a corporate policy change that largely brings it in line with
onetime rival AT&AMP;T Corp., AOL has called off lobbying efforts for
new state and local laws to require access to cable broadband
systems. It said it will seek instead to achieve those goals by
negotiations ``in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has been among the fiercest proponents of opening fast cable
access systems such as MediaOne's RoadRunner service to competing
Internet service providers, calling it an issue of consumer
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   But it has widely been expected to lose heart for the fight
after announcing its $120 billion takeover of Time Warner, the
nation's leading cable provider. Under AOL's previous philosophy,
Time Warner's high-speed access systems would have been forced open
to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Largely confirming reports over the weekend, AOL spokeswoman
Kathy McKiernan said Monday, ``Our focus is on making open access
real for the consumer in the marketplace. We are not pushing
legislation at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior AOL official confirmed that McKiernan's comments apply
to Massachusetts' proposed November ballot question, which AOL ``is
not opposing but is not actively pushing'' now.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials also said they have no plans to try to unwind an
exclusive contract Time Warner has in place through 2001, similar
to MediaOne's Massachusetts arrangements, to make RoadRunner the
affiliated Internet service provider for Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's absence from the ballot fight leaves backers with
virtually no rich giant to counter a flood of money being poured by
AT&AMP;T into opposing the question. AT&AMP;T, which has announced plans to
buy MediaOne this spring, already has thrown $1.1 million into
opposing the question, saying the issue should be left to cable
providers and Internet service providers, or ISPs, to negotiate
without regulatory interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're looking at going ahead, but no matter what
kind of backing we have, we have always been looking at a David vs.
Goliath fight,'' said Stephen Allen, spokesman for the committee
organizing the ballot question. He reiterated that question
organizers would back off if AT&AMP;T and MediaOne negotiate ``a real
deal'' to open up to other ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Allen's group include local ISPs Berkshire.net,
HarvardNet and Shore.net, which have nothing close to the financial
might of AT&AMP;T and MediaOne. Boston venture capitalist J.
Christopher Grace, a large AOL stockholder, has put $600,000 into
backing the question, but he has not said whether the AOL-Time
Warner merger will cause him to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Among ISPs in the same league as AT&AMP;T and MediaOne, GTE
Internetworking of Burlington, Mass. has spoken out for open
access. But in Massachusetts, GTE officials are expected to stay
out of the ballot fight because Bell Atlantic _ which is merging
with GTE _ is seen as wanting to save political capital for its
quest to enter the $2 billion Bay State long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   GTE spokeswoman Briana Gowing said recently that the company
continues to support the cause of open access, but ``we haven't
specifically endorsed that ballot question.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Farrah John, spokeswoman for the MediaOne-backed group
opposing the November ballot question, said the AOL-Time Warner
combination ``proves that this is a dynamic market that is creating
choices for consumers. Government doesn't need to get involved.
We're going to continue to fight the petition because it's bad for
consumers and taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The November ballot question would require owners of cable modem
systems _ in Massachusetts chiefly MediaOne and some upgraded
Adelphia franchises _ to allow ISPs to resell high-speed access
over those networks to their own subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   McKiernan said AOL has changed only tactics, not philosophy, in
backing off legislation-based open access. ``AOL is as strongly
committed to open access today as we were the day before we
announced our merger with Time Warner. Where we have moved is in
how to get from here to there,'' McKiernan said.

CMGI TO PAY $920M FOR CONNECTICUT E-COMMERCE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another week, another acquisition for the Internet company CMGI
Inc. This time, the Andover, Mass. company will pay $920 million in
cash and stock for Tallan Corp., a Connecticut electronic commerce
firm with roots that go far deeper than the Internet's.
</P>
<P>
   Tallan was founded in 1985, long before millions of people
started shopping online. It specializes in complex ``back-office''
computer systems retailers use to keep track of inventory,
deliveries, and customer preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as Business Data Services, Tallan changed its
name this year and today places a heavy emphasis on building
computer support systems for online retailers. Tallan's customers
include the name-your-own-price retailer Priceline, the online
bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble.com, and the toy merchant eToys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around for 15 years, we've been profitable, and the
work we do transcends the Internet focus,'' said Bruce Guptill,
vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI will pay $340 million in cash, the rest in CMGI shares and
options. Tallan will become part of CMGI Solutions, a unit that
specializes in providing complete e-commerce systems for large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of CMGI Solutions, Ron Spears, said his
company needs Tallan's expertise in heavy-duty retail data
processing. ``There are just a large number of enterprise-type
clients . . . that have come to CMGI and are asking us to fulfill
these kinds of requirements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guptill said the deal with CMGI gives his company ``an immediate
market presence that would be very time-consuming and
resource-consuming to get on our own.'' Besides, he added, ``they
paid a good price for us. It's a nice way to reward a lot of people
who worked a decade and a half to build this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallan, of Glastonbury, Conn., recently filed for an initial
public stock offering. This will be converted into an offering of
stock for the entire CMGI Solutions business unit sometime in the
next 120 days, Tallan and CMGI officers said.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI stock closed at 115 1/2, up 3 7/16, on the Nasdaq stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has spent $6.5 billion buying stakes in 24 Internet and
software companies in the past year, Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   It owns 16 companies and holds minority interests in 49 others.

U.S. CREATES FEDERAL TASK FORCE TO TACKLE WAR ON DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lack of federal teamwork in the war on drugs
spurred the Clinton administration Monday to create a task force to
ensure cooperation among U.S. anti-drug agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In a report calling for interagency cooperation, the Clinton
administration said U.S. departments, unaware of what each was
doing to fight drugs, have needlessly duplicated efforts and shown
mutual ``mistrust and confusion.'' The study, which Congress
mandated, called for the creation of a federal task force of 13
representatives from agencies involved in fighting narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. anti-drug chief Barry McCaffrey and Attorney General Janet
Reno, in announcing the group's formation, said the lack of federal
cooperation has hindered the nation's effort to stop the flow of
illegal drugs. The illicit narcotics trade causes 52,000 U.S.
deaths per year and imposes $110 billion in annual social and
health-care costs, the Clinton administration reported.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, the Counterdrug Intelligence Coordinating Group,
will meet regularly to share top-secret information and develop
strategies to stop the flow of illegal drugs both into and within
the United States, said McCaffrey, who directs the Office of
National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The data will be shared with state and local law-enforcement
agencies, which McCaffrey said are on the front lines in the battle
against drugs. But the data will first be distilled to ensure that
confidential information on the sources and methods of gaining the
data are not disclosed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agencies in the task force will be the departments
of Justice, Treasury, Transportation and State; the Federal Bureau
of Investigation; the U.S. Customs Service; the Drug Enforcement
Administration; the Internal Revenue Service; the Coast Guard; the
National Security Council; and the Office of National Drug Control
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   These agencies each perform vital functions in the drug war, but
their duties have been carried out largely independent of each
other, said McCaffrey. The task force will end this independence by
placing heightened emphasis on combining information and
formulating joint strategies, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the DEA, which investigates people who deal drugs,
will now share data with the Treasury Department, which
investigates narcotics traffickers who try to hide their ill-gotten
money.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, referred to as the nation's so-called drug czar,
called it unconscionable that federal, state and local law
enforcement lack a shared database on drug seizures. Combining
their information will permit drug-enforcement agents to have
better knowledge of who, when and where drugs are entering the
United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the counterdrug task force is the latest in a
series of similar initiatives McCaffrey has taken in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he and the Treasury Department released a federal
strategy to combat money ``laundering,'' the illegal practice
whereby drug dealers attempt to conceal their gains from police by
placing their money in legitimate businesses, such as banks.
</P>
<P>
   In December, McCaffrey joined local law-enforcement officials in
reporting that the federal government would increase its assistance
to 31 High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas nationwide.

WEB SITE TO OFFER EXCESS INVENTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ RetailExchange.com, an independent offshoot of Gordon
Brothers Group LLC of Boston, has launched a Web site where
manufacturers can sell excess inventory to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Did Tommy Hilfiger make too many yellow golf shirts? This Web
site would serve as a marketplace that links designers with retail
chains interested in taking overruns off designers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Some regard Gordon Brothers as the mortician of retail. When a
chain fails, Gordon Brothers often arranges its liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, we couldn't spell the word Internet, but we
knew it was going to somehow impact our business,'' said Kenneth
Frieze, a Gordon Brothers alumnus who runs RetailExchange.com.
</P>
<P>
   RetailExchange.com was conceived during a brainstorming session
on how Gordon Brothers might address the online world.
</P>
<P>
   Other entrepreneurs have rushed to set up Web sites that match
buyers and sellers, but only RetailExchange.com has a unique
``merchant's perspective'' on retail inventory, said Frieze, who is
also a son of Gordon Brothers chief executive Michael Frieze.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other dot-com companies, RetailExchange.com isn't
duplicating online what it does in the brick-and-mortar world.
RetailExchange.com is not about online liquidation. Nor is it an
auction site where merchandise is sold to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Designers have more concerns than just getting the best price on
excess shirts; they also need to protect their brands. If their
shirts ``wind up in schlocky stores,'' it can undermine a
designer's brand, Frieze said. So a designer may want to deal only
with retailers that agree to sell the shirts overseas.
</P>
<P>
   At the RetailExchange.com Web site, a designer can enter
negotiations in private chat rooms with potential buyers on exactly
how their goods will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   RetailExchange.com aims to make money by taking a small
percentage of transactions negotiated at its site.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world of designers and jobbers, buying and selling
excess merchandise can be a lengthy, cumbersome process.
</P>
<P>
   But Web site search features can squeeze much of the cost out of
the process. Instead of many phone calls and plane trips to see
what excess merchandise is available, a retail chain's buyer can go
to RetailExchange.com's Web site and search listings and photos for
the kind of goods the buyer is interested in.
</P>
<P>
   At Bradlees Inc. of Braintree, the chain's buyers are always
prowling for good deals. Not only may RetailExchange.com save time
and money, it gives Bradlees access to a far wider universe of
sellers and merchandise, said Bradlees chairman and chief executive
Peter Thorner, and that could mean that Bradlees customers could
see better values on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   To date, RetailExchange.com has received $11 million in venture
capital funding from Internet Capital Group, Dorset Capital,
Castile Ventures, and Gordon Brothers, and the hope is to take
RetailExchange.com public some day. To alert the players in the $25
billion US market for excess retail goods, Frieze hired Boston ad
agency Holland Mark Edmund Ingalls.

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

RAYTHEON SCHEDULE LAG BLAMED IN NAVY CONTRACT LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Navy has cancelled a contract with Raytheon Co. to upgrade
some P-3 Orion ocean patrol aircraft after the defense contractor
fell behind schedule on the work.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a bad time for Raytheon, which is trying to
improve performance at its disparate units and turn around its
faltering profits and share price.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Navy nor Raytheon would discuss the financial impact
of the cancellation. The contract could have been worth more than
$200 million to Raytheon if it had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was part of what the Navy calls a ``sustained
readiness program'' being carried out in Greenville, Texas. The P-3
is a four-engine Lockheed Martin design that went into service in
the 1960s. Like many of the Navy's planes, its airframes and
electronic components are being modified or upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   The contract had called for Raytheon to repair 32 of the old
planes, but the Navy told the Lexington, Mass. defense contractor
to stop work after it finished repairs on the 13th aircraft,
according to a Jan. 21 letter sent to the company by a Navy
contract officer and obtained by The Boston Globe. The Navy told
Raytheon to prepare the remaining planes to be flown to another,
unspecified facility within the United States for maintenance or
other options.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy reached its decision after conducting a review of the
program and despite a Raytheon proposal to restructure the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the Navy no longer views the (program), as
originally conceived, as the best and most economical approach to
extending the service life of the P-3 aircraft,'' said Raytheon
spokesman Dave Shea.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the Navy determined that concluding the
program early is ``in the best interest of both the US Navy and
RSC,'' meaning Raytheon Systems Co.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Diane Balderson, a contracting official
in the Naval Air Systems Command headquarters in Patuxent River,
Md. The letter does not detail the reasoning behind the Navy's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Balderson referred questions to a Navy public affairs official,
Rob Koon, who confirmed the substance of the letter but said
neither Balderson nor others would discuss the decision Monday or
its impact on the Navy's P-3 fleet. Raytheon will continue to
provide some components and maintenance, the letter stated. Last
fall Raytheon had said its work on some P-3 planes was lagging, but
until Monday it hadn't disclosed the end of the program.
</P>
<P>
   The cancelation may not have a major financial impact on
Raytheon, given its revenue of $19.8 billion in 1999. But the
problems are only the latest in a series for the country's
third-largest defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares have sunk to a fraction of their high of last summer
as the company has disclosed a series of financial problems and
difficulties integrating acquisitions it made during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems with the P-3 seem to fit the same
description. The work is being done in facilities in Greenville,
which Raytheon acquired as part of its $2.3 billion purchase of
Dallas-based E-Systems Inc. in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Balderson's letter also makes reference to a proposal Raytheon
made in November to restructure the program. According to the
letter, Raytheon alleged that government actions ``impaired'' its
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's Shea declined to elaborate. Balderson also wrote the
Navy hoped to negotiate a settlement agreement by Tuesday. Raytheon
eclined to discuss whether talks are under way.

 &HT;    Court:Jermaine Dupri owes Ga. county 3 jail days
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Court of Appeals says millionaire rapper
Jermaine Dupri should go to jail for three days.
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld a ruling by Fayette County Superior Court Judge
Chris Edwards, who became upset when Dupri skipped out on jury
duty. In May, Edwards found Dupri in contempt of court and
sentenced him to three days in the Fayette County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri's lawyer appealed and says he'll keep appealing to the
Georgia Supreme Court, meaning Dupri remains free while the higher
court considers the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in fundamental disagreement with the opinion issued by
the Georgia Court of Appeals,'' attorney Michael Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said in court documents that Dupri had not willfully
disrespected the court.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri showed up for the first day of jury duty March 1 and was
excused for March 2 with the rest of the jury pool. Dupri had
received waivers from jury service in the past and wrongly assumed
Edwards would grant a waiver for the rest of the week, Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri left town to perform March 3 at the Meadowlands in New
Jersey. Dupri offered to perform some sort of community service as
compensation for missing three days of jury duty, such as a benefit
concert, but Edwards turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County District Attorney Bill McBroom said the ruling
sends a good message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they let this guy disregard his jury summons, what will
stop other people from doing the same thing?'' McBroom said.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri is a giant in the world of rap and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri's success as producer of the pre-teen rap duo Kris Kross
made him a millionaire before he turned 21. He produces acts such
as TLC and Usher and has written million-sellers for Mariah Carey
(``Always Be My Baby''), Usher (``You Make Me Wanna'') and himself
(``Money Ain't a Thing'').
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he's expanded by starting his own label, So So
Def Records, and started a sports management firm. In October, he
threw a star-studded 27th birthday party for himself that lasted
four days and occupied large venues such as the Atlanta Civic
Center.

SPORTS COLUMN: EUROPEANS' SUCCESS HAS A PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not that long ago that European players, generically
known as ``Chicken Swedes,'' were pummeled regularly on the premise
they would crumple onto the ice and give up their fancy-skating
ways.
</P>
<P>
   These goonish tactics have been nullified by the evolution of
the foreign superstars, plus the occasional Chippy Swede,
Stick-Wielding Russian and Downright Certifiable Lithuanian. How do
you say ``Boys will be boys'' in Finnish?
</P>
<P>
   Now the National Hockey League is about to have one of those
Europeans as a head coach. The Pittsburgh Penguins have signed Ivan
Hlinka, who coached the 1998 Olympic gold-medal-winning Czech
national team, to be an associate to Herb Brooks for the rest of
this season, and the assumption is that Hlinka will take over next
year. And why not? The Penguins have six Czech players, and the
``national'' league has become truly international; an estimated 30
percent of players come from Northern Europe, including many of the
players with the most skill and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Now the league is about to be squeezed a bit for all the
transplanted talent from Bure, Selanne, Forsberg, Jagr, Hasek, etc.
etc.
</P>
<P>
   The European hockey federations are demanding far bigger
transfer fees for players they develop in their cohesive
grass-roots programs. They say they have the legal power to keep
NHL players out of the next Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   How do you say ``a very different kind of power play'' in Czech?
</P>
<P>
   Transfer fees are a major cost of business in soccer, the sport
most applicable to hockey. The richest soccer clubs in Barcelona
and Turin and Manchester pay huge fees to teams and federations in
Amsterdam and Rio _ even Chicago _ for developing great young
players.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is currently scoffing at the threat, but participating
in the Olympics is a no-brainer. The league, with its tilt toward
the Sun Belt, sorely needs a couple of weeks of Olympic glamour
every four years.
</P>
<P>
   The last time there were Winter Games, in Nagano in 1998, Ivan
Hlinka's players outworked the somewhat less-motivated Russians,
Canadians and Americans. Four of the key Penguins _ Jagr, Martin
Straka, Jiri Slegr and Robert Lang _ were members of that
gold-medal team, and two other Penguins, Jan Hrdina and Michal
Rozsival, are from the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The league has come a long way since the bullying of the first
Swedes in the late 1970s. Hlinka, a legend in the old
Czechoslovakia for his exploits on the big sheet of international
hockey, played for Vancouver in the early 1980s, producing 123
points in 137 games.
</P>
<P>
   There are already three European assistants in the league: Alpo
Suhonen of Toronto, a Finn; Slava Lener of Florida, a Czech; and
Slava Fetisov of the Devils, one of the first great Soviet players
to come to the NHL. But Hlinka has the fast road to being head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is great that a Czech coach can come here,'' said
Petr Nedved, the Czech-born center on the Rangers, who never played
for Hlinka but added, ``I hear he's a player's coach, not exactly
screaming and yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, who played in Vancouver in 1990-91, recalled how North
Americans ``tested you during the game, but the sport has changed
in the last five, six years. Now they are seeing that the Europeans
can bring something to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the league ready for a European coach? Nobody wants to come
off as the John Rocker of hockey and say no. Besides, people know
Hlinka is a capable hockey man, but there are still some
differences between the NHL and world hockey.
</P>
<P>
   One difference is the 200-feet-by-85-feet ice surface in the
NHL, which is smaller than international rinks. And the North
American style still places more value on muckers and grinders than
the European style does, but, then again, it is always jolly good
fun to see NHL stars flopping out of position during international
play.
</P>
<P>
   A second difference is that Hlinka's English is said to be
rough, and it is not known if he speaks any French.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played here and he knows the game, but language could be a
problem,'' said Bobby Holik, the Czech-born member of the Devils,
who speaks excellent English after a decade here.
</P>
<P>
   ``A player lets his game speak for him, but a coach has to be a
strategist,'' Holik added. ``I never played for him, but everybody
says he's a good hockey man.''
</P>
<P>
   We have come this far that a ``good hockey man'' can come from
the Czech Republic. What are a few rubles and a few korunas to pay
for this major talent infusion? &QL;

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

McCAIN DEFENDS RECORD ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, S.C. _ John McCain defended inconsistencies in his
congressional record and rhetoric on campaign finance Monday while
George W. Bush complained that Democrats were working to defeat him
in the upcoming Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain repeated his opposition to public financing of
political campaigns, he conceded he had voted for measures before
the Senate with a public-financing component.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,''
the Arizona senator said. ``I will make compromises; that's the
essence of legislating. ... I'm saying that I would rather have
something that had some public financing in it than the present
system.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain expressed disdain that Bush would challenge him on the
issue and declared that ``this kind of savagery'' is unnecessarily
negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any doubt I'm the leader for campaign-finance reform
in America? Is there any doubt?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides distributed a list of 11 amendments to three
campaign-finance reform measures in 1990, 1991 and 1993 on which
McCain voted against public financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of me putting out a major difference certainly isn't
savaging,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did he call it savagery? The man made five votes,
legitimate votes, on the floor of the Senate. It's what we call
full exposure, full disclosure,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will continue to press McCain on ``differences of
opinion'' when they meet Tuesday night in a debate, four days
before the South Carolina Republican primary, for which the battle
between the two men has become more bitter by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to say how aggressive he will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be short of savagery,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called public financing of campaigns the ``incumbent
protection act.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins the nomination, he will take about $60 million in
taxpayer money for his general election campaign. Each nominee
receives that much, while the Reform Party nominee will receive $12
million.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush defended such financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because there's federal funding in presidential elections
doesn't mean there should be federal funding in congressional
elections,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also suggested that Democrats may flood South Carolina's
open primary to vote for McCain, putting a twist on the
conventional wisdom that McCain gathers some of his support from
independents and Democrats because of his reformist message.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a Democratic state lawmaker, Rep. Todd Rutherford, had
urged voters to back McCain. Bush said the GOP nomination should be
decided by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a primary to search our souls in the Republican Party
to make up our minds,'' Bush told the 200 Republicans in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had nothing against Democrats voting in the
Republican primary for legitimate reasons, ``I just don't want
Democrats coming into vote against me because they think my
opponent will be easier to beat in November.'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford on WIS-TV Sunday had urged black voters to back the
``weaker candidate'' in the GOP primary. Rutherford originally said
that was McCain, but he later said Bush may be the weaker candidate
by Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by Saturday Bush is the weaker candidate, we encourage
those people who want to go vote in the Republican primary to vote
for Bush,'' Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain picked up the endorsement Monday of conservative Jim
Miles, the South Carolina secretary of state. The backing was
intended to counteract a stepped-up Bush campaign to question
McCain's conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a prototype conservative,'' Miles told a McCain town-hall
meeting at an American Legion hall in Greenwood. Questions the Bush
campaign is raising about McCain's ideological leanings ``offends
me,'' Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was different when South Carolina Democrats flooded
into the GOP primary in 1980 to vote for Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why Democrats came to Ronald Reagan in 1980 was
because of a stark philosophical difference. They heard his call
for tax cuts,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be philosophical differences in order to win the
general election,'' he said. ``There is no philosophical difference
on tax cuts between Vice President (Al) Gore and John McCain. They
essentially take the same position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain sparred frequently in New Hampshire over tax
cuts. Bush portrayed his $483 billion tax cut plan as a cut for all
Americans, while McCain said his $240 billion plan would use more
of the federal budget surplus to shore up Social Security and pay
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried Monday to retool his tax cut message, saying its
purpose is to maintain the nation's healthy economy by giving
entrepreneurs money for investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not call it the tax debate any more. Let's call it the
growth debate,'' Bush said. ``Let's have someone who's been an
entrepreneur carrying the banner of our party, someone who's met a
payroll waving that banner of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been a businessman, while McCain has been in Congress
for 18 years.

that Reagan brought to presidential campaigns. For McCain is still
brandishing as his main campaign weapon his relentless

George W. Bush. But more and more, McCain drops suggestions that

MAINE FOREST RANGERS SEEK RIGHT TO USE DEADLY FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maine's forest rangers, whose duties in the woods have expanded
from fire prevention to enforcement of a growing number of
environmental and criminal offenses, will know within weeks whether
their public role will move in the direction of Smokey the Bear or
Smokey and the Bandit.
</P>
<P>
   A bill now before Maine's legislature would supply the state's
75 rangers with firearms. For years, rangers have complained that
their growing mission is leading them into tense standoffs with
timber thieves, violent drunks and armed criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal has met with opposition from Governor Angus
King and from the commissioner of the Department of Conservation,
who say guns would alter the rangers' overwhelmingly friendly
public image, thereby exposing them to more danger, not less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is akin to arming your fire department,'' said Conservation
Commissioner Ron Lovaglio, whose agency oversees the rangers.
``They enjoy tremendous public support. In terms of the good guys
of government that people meet on a daily basis, they're probably
at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument over who forest rangers should be has split Maine's
legislature along lines that are perplexing even to the bill's
sponsors. Everyone agrees that their identity has drifted over the
years _ from 1950, when Austin Wilkins decided to boost the
rangers' prestige by instituting the first-ever uniform, to the
early 1990s, when they started carrying handcuffs, to the decision
five years ago that they should train at the Maine Criminal Justice
Academy among freshly-minted state troopers, police officers and
sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers say the most important change came with the Forest
Practices Act of 1991, which charged them with investigating a new
list of environmental offenses, including timber theft and arson.
At that point, rangers found themselves drifting into the territory
of police work whether they liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does bother me. I think you'll find that most rangers
became forest rangers not necessarily for law enforcement but for
the environmental aspect,'' said Ranger William Greaves, a 14-year
veteran from Island Falls who estimates that a third of his time
now goes to enforcement of environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think how we're perceived is changing,'' Greaves said.
``We're out there doing so much more than we were 15 years ago. We
represent so much more. We were firemen 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Greaves has a particular stake in the question of ranger safety,
since he was shot in the hip 10 years ago by a suspect while
assisting a sherriff's deputy, armed with a borrowed gun. He thinks
the incident could have been avoided if he had been properly
trained. In 1997, another ranger was held at gunpoint when he
responded to a complaint of burning without a permit, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a Forest Service report that 24 rangers had received
physical or verbal threats over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next question is, what are we going to do, wait until a
ranger is killed?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of World War Two, when German prisoners of war
and coastal patrols made Maine's North Woods ``a kind of a
frontier,'' it was common for forest rangers to carry guns,
according to Charles Gadzik, director of Maine's Forest Service
until last year. But in the 1960s, as the state professionalized
the rangers' mission, guns were deemed unneccessary to the rangers'
primary duties of fire prevention and environmental compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the rangers' demands for arms were almost
gratified. The state legislature passed a measure that would have
armed the rangers, but ran into trouble when the Appropriations
Committee balked at the plan's cost, which was estimated at
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the proposal's opponents say the cost is less
important than the question of whether arming rangers would really
contribute to their safety. Issuing guns to a group of public
servants would nudge the rangers further into the realm of police
work, requiring a revolution in screening and training as well as a
potentially dangerous change in the way they interact with the
public, Lovaglio argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when the friendly state trooper stops to give you a
ticket, you look at that weapon and it changes the situation,'' he
said. ``Conflict can escalate very quickly and make it more
confrontational. Introducing the firearm itself adds as many risks
as it takes away.''
</P>
<P>
   That thought comes as as small comfort to Smith, who fears that
rangers will only encounter more and more hostility from the public
in coming years. If King vetoes the bill, he said, the rangers will
return to the issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in situations where we need to wait for another agency
to back us up,'' Smith said. ``Well, there are a lot of areas where
backup is two or three hours away. If we show up at a campsite and
a guy is beating on his wife, what are we going to do?''

HEALTHEON TO ACQUIRE 2 COMPETITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a strong bid to dominate health care on the Internet,
Healtheon/WebMD Corp. agreed Monday to buy two competitors, Medical
Manager Corp. and CareInsite Inc., both headed by financier Martin
J. Wygod, for $5.2 billion in Healtheon stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal increased the potential of Healtheon, a start-up that
has yet to make a profit. Its goal is to connect doctors, patients
and insurers online and to slash the enormous nonmedical costs of
paperwork and administration in the nation's trillion-dollar health
care system.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction also raised the multimillion-dollar stake in the
Internet companies of a New York hospital association and four
insurance companies based in New York and Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes Healtheon the 800-pound gorilla in the marketplace,
without a clear No. 2 player,'' said William McKeever, a health
care analyst at PaineWebber Securities. ``Now they have to
execute,'' he said, meaning recruit enough doctors and health plans
to make the business profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading, Medical Manager shares soared $21.75, or 33
percent, to $86.75 Monday. CareInsite rose $4.125, to $72.
Healtheon/WebMD was up $1.625, to $56.625.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., was founded
four years ago by the Internet pioneer James H. Clark of Netscape
fame. It grew by making 80 alliances, acquisitions and partners in
the last 18 months. Two weeks ago, it agreed to buy Envoy, the
largest electronic processor of medical bills, for $2.5 billion in
stock. Medical Manager has provided software to 185,000 of the
country's 777,000 doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, all of a sudden, they are the largest electronic
processor of claims transactions and they will have the largest
access to physicians,'' said Claudine Singer, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a New York-based Internet research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have their tentacles in every established health care
connectivity player that's out there,'' she added. ``The biggest
challenge is to get the rest of the doctors online. Their biggest
competitor is inertia,'' the reluctance of many doctors to
computerize their practices.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was the latest in a string of health business coups for
Wygod, the New Jersey financier who said in a phone interview that
his stake in the merged company would be ``eight or nine million
shares.'' That would be valued at $400 million to $500 million,
based on Monday's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   He said computer links could help keep health plans viable,
connect doctors to patients and rescue physicians from a quagmire
of managed care bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world you have so many health plans, so many plan
designs, guidelines and formularies (drugs that are covered by
insurance),'' he said, ``that it is impossible for a physician to
function without the right connectivity, without having all that
information at the time he is seeing the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that creating such links would not be easy. ``My
biggest question is how quickly we can get there,'' said Stephen
FitzGibbons, an analyst in San Francisco at Chase H&AMP;Q. ``It's not
the type of problem that will be solved in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that there was a huge potential for cost cutting.
``One insurance company has 12,000 employees taking telephone
calls'' to approve or reject claims from doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Wygod sold an earlier venture, Medco Containment Services Inc.,
to Merck &AMP; Co. for $6.6 billion in 1993. He came away with $250
million in stock and fees. He created CareInsite, based in Elmwood
Park, N.J., around a Medco unit he bought back from Merck. He
merged CareInsite into Medical Manager last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Merck filed a lawsuit last March against Wygod and other former
Medco employees, charging that they had violated noncompete
agreements. CareInsite filed counterclaims against Merck. A Merck
spokesman said its suit was still pending in Superior Court in
Morris County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Medical Manager, which owns 68.8 percent of
CareInsite, will each be exchanged for 1.65 shares of Healtheon.
CareInsite's other shares will each be exchanged for 1.3 shares.
Healtheon has issued 95 million new shares, valued at $5.2 billion,
based on last Friday's price.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Arnold, chief executive of Healtheon, and Mike Long, chief
operating officer, will keep those posts. Wygod and Long will be
co-chairmen of Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   The minority shareholders also include a group of New York
hospitals and health insurance companies that recently sold their
plan for an electronic network to Wygod for a total of 3.6 million
shares of CareInsite. Similarly, New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue
Shield joined the CareInsite network and received warrants for
811,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said Monday's deal could ``provide information
technology, capital and access that never existed before.'' A
nonprofit unit of his association and the insurers, Empire Blue
Cross and Blue Shield, HIP and Group Health Inc., each received
about 900,000 shares, which would translate to 1.19 million shares
of Healtheon.

SOME CATHOLIC TEACHERS SAY THEY'LL DEFY `MANDATE' RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Catholic theologians, including the chairman of Boston
College's theology department, say they plan to defy a church
requirement that they seek approval of their teaching from their
local bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Dietrich, the theology department head, and Peter
Beisheim, a professor of religious studies at Stonehill College,
say they consider the expected requirement for church permission to
teach Catholic theology a violation of their academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine most folks here would not seek a mandate...and
my own personal plan would not be to seek a mandate,'' Dietrich
said. ``My thinking is that a university is a university, and is an
autonomous entity that should be supportive of free thought in the
American tradition. You can't have free thought if there's a
mandate and some kind of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Beisheim used even stronger language, saying: ``I have no fear
about getting a mandate if I was to present myself, but I see it as
a form of ecclesiastical McCarthyism. I don't need to take a
loyalty oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College is a Catholic, Jesuit-run university in Chestnut
Hill, Mass.; Stonehill is a Catholic college in Easton, Mass.
operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross, which also runs the
University of Notre Dame. There are seven other Catholic colleges
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that Catholic theologians get approval, known to
Catholics as a mandate, from their local bishop was adopted by the
US Catholic bishops last November, and is now awaiting approval by
the Vatican. The bishops have said that once the proposal is
approved by the Vatican, they will spend a year discussing how
exactly to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Catholic theologians contacted Monday said they were
willing, or even eager, to get approval, called by Catholics a
mandate, from the church. Others said they will wait to see the
specifics of the process before deciding what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholic theologians have been on edge since the US bishops
last fall submitted to the Vatican a new proposal that would
require Catholic theologians to get a mandate to teach from the
church. But the theologians have been particularly abuzz for the
last week, since a prominent Notre Dame theologian, the Rev.
Richard McBrien, wrote an essay for the Jesuit magazine America
that was featured on the cover with the headline ``Why I shall not
seek a mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, theologians have been e-mailing and calling one
another and their professional associations, intensifying a
discussion that has been under way in various forms since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very worried about it,'' said Sister Margaret
Farley, a professor of Christian ethics at Yale Divinity School and
the president of the Catholic Theological Society of America. ``I'm
getting lots of messages, most from individuals, but in some major
Catholic universities, whole departments are trying to decide what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Theresa Moser, the head of another professional
association, the College Theology Association, said the bulk of her
members are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hot-button issue,'' she said. ``There are some
people that are thinking about requesting a mandate because they
see themselves as in communion with the church, but there are other
people with strong positions like Dr. McBrien's.''
</P>
<P>
   The requirement for a mandate was approved by the bishops in an
effort to comply with ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae,'' a document dealing
with Catholic higher education issued by Pope John Paul II in 1990.
In addition to requiring approval of theologians, the document
recommends that Catholics make up a majority of the faculty and the
trustees of Catholic universities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unanswered questions about the mandate requirement:
what happens if a Catholic theologian refuses to seek, or is
denied, a mandate from the local bishop? Some academicians are also
debating whether the rule would apply to theologians who teach in
religious studies departments, as opposed to theology departments,
and whether the rule would apply retroactively to anyone now
teaching theology, or only to people who started teaching after the
requirement was put in place.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law, who would be responsible for
deciding whether to approve the teachings of Catholic theologians
at colleges within the Archdiocese of Boston, had no comment
Monday. The Rev. William Leahy, president of Boston College, plans
no action against faculty members who refuse to seek a mandate,
according to a spokesman, John Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Leahy met with the theology department and is leaving
it up to them,'' Dunn said. ``The university's position is it's an
individual Catholic theologian's decision to seek a mandate or not
to seek a mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Catholic theologians said they are willing to comply. In
most cases those theologians had trained in Europe, where they said
theologians regularly seek mandates from the church hierarchy and
academic freedom is unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no more an obstacle to serious intellectual
scholarship than would be the requirement that someone who gets a
doctorate in law has to pass a bar or someone who gets a medical
degree has to be certified,'' said the Rev. Matthew Lamb, a Boston
College theologian, who complained that many people teaching
theology at Catholic colleges have received inadequate training at
non-Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Roger Corriveau, a theology professor at Assumption
College, a Catholic college in Worcester, Mass., also expressed a
willingness to get a mandate, saying ``I'm a Catholic priest and
it's my intention to be teaching the church's teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Harvey Egan, a Boston College theologian, said he
expects to seek a mandate but that he considers the requirement a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake...it's causing unnecessary confusion
and trouble and the results are going to be nil,'' Egan said. ``But
I would get it. It's truth in advertising. To be a Catholic
theologian means you have to respect the magisterium (authority to
teach religious doctrine).''
</P>
<P>
   Other theologians said they would wait to see the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching it very carefully, but there's been no decision
about where we will stand,'' said Ernest Collamati, a professor of
religious studies at Regis College, a Catholic college in Weston,
Mass. ``I'm basically counting on our professional societies to do
a good job, and I hope whatever will emerge will be palatable and
good.''

 &HT;    The face of CNN just lets it roll in interviews
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry King leans forward when he talks, off-camera as well as
on. Talks, sometimes, in quick, incomplete spurts, like those
little observational blippets in his much-mocked USA Today column.
</P>
<P>
   Here's King's answer to ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt better in my whole life. Just had my annual
physical. Heart's fine. Baby's 10 months old, another one coming in
June. Can't believe it. Amazing. I woke up this morning in Beverly
Hills and said I can't believe it. At this age. Really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy to make fun of. Impossible to ignore. The wives, the
suspenders, the raspy voice, the heart problems, the schmoozing,
the memoirs, the microphone. King, 66, probably has close to the
least formal journalistic training of anyone at CNN, yet he is the
news network's heart in some ways, its most recognizable face and
the host of its most popular show.
</P>
<P>
   He moderates a Republican presidential debate at 9 tonight in
South Carolina, in a 90-minute edition of ``Larry King Live.''
Candidates George W. Bush, John McCain and Alan Keyes are scheduled
to appear in the session, four days before the South Carolina
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   King says he'll bring his famous-infamous unpreparedness with
him tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let the tide take it,'' he says. If he asks a question of
Candidate A, he explains, and notices that during A's answer
Candidate B shows some reaction, he'll immediately follow up with
B.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I sit there with 14 prepared questions, I'm not
listening to their answers, because I'm thinking about Question No.
3. Wherever it goes, that's where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   No way any of those questions will be as brutally tough as
Bernard Shaw's famous 1988 toss to Michael Dukakis, asking him if
his wife Kitty were raped and murdered, would he support the death
penalty for the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Not for King the gruffness of Mike Wallace, the prickly
intelligence of Bryant Gumbel, the bluster of Sam Donaldson. He's
an affable kind of interviewer, a style his detractors knock and
King defends.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd
once called ``Larry King Live'' ``the resort area of American
journalism, the media's Palm Springs, where politicians and other
figures of controversy or celebrity go to unwind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Softball questions,'' his media critics call them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that,'' King says. ``I don't know what the term
means. My role as I see it is to be me. To ask the best questions.
To ask short questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Softball to me is, 'Whats your next movie?' `What do you dream
of?' ``How do you feel about love?' I never ask that.''
</P>
<P>
   King is leaning forward, not belligerent, but on a roll. It's a
recent afternoon in a Los Angeles hotel room, where King is
answering questions, something he likes much less than asking them.
But he's warmed to the topic of softball questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra's one of those people, he laid down a rule the first
time I interviewed him I couldn't ask him about his son's
kidnapping. And he wound up telling me about it, cause I asked him
a question about the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Dan Quayle would he support his daughter if she had an
abortion? Would he go with her to the hospital? It's how you do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose I said (and he starts to bark like Walter Winchell on
his old radio show): `You're against abortion, Mr. Quayle! What if
your daughter had an abortion!?'
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of answer do you think I'd get?
</P>
<P>
   ``The stupidest question was the guy (a New York radio deejay)
who asked Hillary Clinton if she'd had an affair. It sounds like an
aggressive question. But it produces what? No answer.''
</P>
<P>
   A few answers about Larry King:
</P>
<P>
   _ He was born Larry Zeiger in Brooklyn, 1933, and grew up poor.
``New York City bought my first pair of glasses. I'll never forget
that,'' he says, and in many of his 11 books he recounts stories of
how poor he was as a youth. He changed his name to King when he
started working as a radio deejay at age 23.
</P>
<P>
   _ He's been married seven times (twice to the same woman, a
former Playboy bunny), and has been a prolific dater throughout his
life. Current wife Shawn Southwick-King 26 years his junior, is
pregnant with the couple's second child, which will be King's
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   _ He quit smoking after his heart attack in 1987. He also had an
angioplasty in 1997, and now exercises religiously. (He was on his
treadmill at home when he first heard about the AOL-Time Warner
merger.)
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, King was host of a national radio call-in
program, working out of Miami. CNN's 9 p.m. talk show was hosted by
a woman named Sandi Freeman. When CNN decided not to renew
Freeman's contract, Turner called King and asked him if he'd like
to join CNN, then a five-year-old network that was still struggling
to achieve respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sports freak,'' King recalls. ``And my first reaction
was, I'm not going to be able to see basketball. I'm not going to
be able to see hockey. I didn't know CNN. I didn't have CNN in my
house.''
</P>
<P>
   King took over, but it wasn't until 1992 that ``Larry King
Live'' became the place for newsmakers to sit and schmooze. That
was the presidential election year when Ross Perot announced on
King's show he would run as an independent if his supporters got
him on the ballot in all 50 states, and interviews with President
George Bush and candidate Bill Clinton and his running mate Al Gore
followed.
</P>
<P>
   King will celebrate 15 years on CNN on June 1, the same night
CNN celebrates its 20th anniversary. He'll do special shows, June
1-2, two hours each, with retrospective clips and special guests;
the only one booked so far is Turner.
</P>
<P>
   His current contract runs through 2002, when he'll be 68. CNN
News Group chairman Tom Johnson says he wants to keep King on as
long as he can, and King says, ``I never think of retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Turner and I were talking about this the other day, and he
asked how many more years `Larry King Live' might have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you'll make 20?'' Turner asked King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, if I stay healthy,'' King told his boss. ``Five more
years sounds good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember interviewing John Steinbeck, and I asked him if
when he wrote `The Grapes of Wrath,' if he knew he was writing a
book that was revolutionary and would change the way we look at
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I just wrote a book.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went on the air. All the rest just sort of happens.''

 &HT;    Ganging up on McCain may backfire
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has attracted notice for his campaign's agility
in raising money over the Internet after his big win in New
Hampshire. But the surging Republican candidate owes more to
Gutenberg and that early forerunner of the information age, the
book, than any reputed innovation of Al Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing contentedly Sunday afternoon at a line the length of
Peachtree Battle Shopping Center, McCain's co-author and aide, Mark
Salter, said the former POW's book, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' has
rebounded onto The New York Times Top 10 best sellers list after
New Hampshire, with total sales approaching 350,000. When
high-priced consultants counsel corporations about synergy, this
apparently is what they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The big crowd at the book-signing Sunday suggests that Georgia,
like South Carolina and Michigan, could be susceptible to McCain
fever, marked by sudden shifts in the polls and the introduction of
foreign bodies into the Republican bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest interpretation of this enthusiasm for McCain is
that it's good for Democrats. There is such a thing as brand
loyalty, and the sight of so many of their number waiting patiently
in nippy weather to have their books autographed by a Republican
ought to give any thinking Democrat pause.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't necessarily follow, however, that the McCain ground
swell will in the long run be good for Republicans. The next five
days will help to determine that, and could play a pivotal role in
the way the election turns out this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened to the implications of a second McCain upset in South
Carolina, the Bush campaign has pulled out all stops, dipping
generously into its fabled war chest and setting the candidate to
pummeling at the upstart.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush badly needs to defeat McCain in South Carolina,
however, there could be some political cost to be paid for shooting
down Luke Skywalker, as McCain as been styling himself in recent
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The media may be sweet on him, as Gov. George W. Bush's camp
grumbles, but McCain, more than any other candidate this year, has
unleashed a current of political excitement in the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush could somehow win the nomination without capping that
ground swell _ most obviously, by ending things on a note whereby
McCain winds up on the ticket _ he could benefit from it. But since
New Hampshire, the race has not headed in such an amiable
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Pat Robertson, once the nemesis of Bush's
father, announced the Christian Coalition would sit out this
election if McCain is the nominee. That's the kind of comment bound
to send more Democrats and independents scurrying to the bookstore
to find out more about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And it illustrates Bush's dilemma. To win in South Carolina,
Bush has to circle the wagons, but not so tightly that he leaves
his campaign no room to expand later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to watch the third candidate, Alan Keyes,
when the newly winnowed GOP field meets in a debate tonight. Keyes
threw the incendiary abortion question at McCain in the last New
Hampshire debate, and in diluting anti-abortion votes he hurt the
recently departed Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has said some critical things of Bush, too. But if tonight
the debate looks like two against one, and McCain's the one, he's
pulled off a remarkable feat of political jujitsu. And he gets a
great chance to play Luke Skywalker.

BORDER AGENTS ON ALERT IN WAKE OF CARTEL THREATS 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Border Patrol officers in West Texas are strapping on bullet
proof vests due to a reported $200,000 bounty on federal agents
offered by the Juarez drug cartel, an agency spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not being alarmists, the threats are serious,'' said
Jorge Swank, a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Border
Patrol in Marfa, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just making sure our officers are aware and exercise
extreme caution ... (and) we're making sure they're on the
lookout,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   Swank would not provide any specifics on the alleged bounty,
which was outlined in an internal Border Patrol memo cited in a
report by an El Paso television station. The report claimed the
bounty was offered by the Juarez cartel and extended to all federal
agencies with a presence on the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal law agencies would not confirm the bounty by the
Ciudad Juarez-based cartel, which operates just across the border
from El-Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're not acknowledging that or commenting on it at
all,'' said FBI agent Andrea Simmons in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Swank said agents in the Marfa sector, a remote area that
includes 420 miles along the Rio Grande, are seizing more narcotics
as drug traffickers shift operations to areas with limited
enforcement. Since October, agents in Marfa have seized $104
million worth of marijuana, cocaine and heroin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are the Border Patrol strategy is working,''
said Swank, referring to containment operations along the border in
San Diego, El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley. ``The only places the
drug traffickers and alien smugglers will push to is Del Rio and
Marfa.''
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, Border Patrol spokesman Doug Mosier said death
threats by drug traffickers have occurred before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had in the past some reported threats made by various
drug cartels, and the last one was issued a couple of months ago,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any rate, we do not dismiss these allegations, and we
always make agents in the field aware of any kind of intelligence''
relating to death threats, Mosier said.

SULLIVAN JUMPS FIDELITY TO START HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The manager of Fidelity Investments' white-hot
Aggressive Growth fund left the firm Monday to start her own hedge
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Sullivan, 29, who has run the $17.2 billion fund since
1997, delivered investors a spectacular 103 percent return last
year. Her departure stunned Fidelity watchers and sparked a domino
effect of management changes, as the fund giant sought to fill her
high-profile job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since Jeff Vinik left have I felt the kind of tremor I
felt today,'' said James Lowell, editor of FidelityInvestor.com in
Needham, Mass. ``It sends a disconcerting message.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinik quit Fidelity's Magellan Fund in 1996, after coming under
attack for betting heavily in bonds and disappointing investors.
Sullivan leaves under considerably different circumstances _ a
rising star who wants to run her own fund rather than climb the
ladder at the nation's biggest fund firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 8 1/2 years of invaluable experience at Fidelity, I have
decided to become an entrepreneur,'' Sullivan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are unregulated portfolios that permit managers to
invest with few rules. Vinik and other famous mutual fund managers
now run hedge funds, where they typically earn 20 percent of the
profits they generate for wealthy customers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sullivan's watch, Aggressive Growth loaded up on
technology stocks and beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index by a
wide margin in 1998 and last year. The fund grew tenfold from $1.7
billion in 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity named Robert Bertelson, manager of Fidelity's OTC
Portfolio, to succeed Sullivan. His fund, which also invests in
Nasdaq-traded technology stocks, notched a 72.5 percent gain last
year but lagged the Nasdaq index's 86.1 percent climb.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lowell, ``I think it's very questionable news for
Aggressive Growth shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity spokeswoman Ann Crowley noted that Bertelson beat 84
percent of mid-cap funds in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always sorry to see talented people go,'' Crowley said.
``But we have an extensive team of people, a very deep bench, and a
great record of training and developing management talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking Bertelson's place on the $11 billion OTC Portfolio is
Jason Weiner, manager of Fidelity Contrafund II. That fund gained
42.5 percent last year, double the performance of the S&AMP;P 500, and
outpaced 82 percent of its peers, Fidelity said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell considers Weiner one of Fidelity's top five stockpickers
and called the move positive for OTC fund investors. He believes
Fidelity lost its best stockpicker when Sullivan walked out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's departure raises questions about fund firms' ability
to hold onto top talent when the market is soaring. Her
performance, while excellent, may be good enough to sell outside
Fidelity, but it was racked up in less than three brief years. She
did not have to see the fund through a down market.
</P>
<P>
   Observed Lowell, ``To be the manager of a hedge fund is not a
piece of cake.''

SCIENTISTS DEFEND SUSPENDED GENE THERAPY PROGRAM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Pa.)  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a vigorous defense of their suspended gene
therapy program, officials at the University of Pennsylvania said
Monday that while there were administrative lapses, they did not in
any way contribute to the death of an 18-year-old patient and
amounted to little more than ``minor deviations'' in bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   In a 28-page written response to the Food and Drug
Administration's decision to shut down all human gene therapy
experiments at Penn, scientists there pledged to draft new
procedures that will allow them to better track patients in their
studies. But at several turns, they challenged the agency's
assertion of ``numerous serious deficiencies'' in their program.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers maintained that the patient who died, Jesse
Gelsinger, was properly enrolled in the clinical trial, while the
FDA said he should never have been treated. They said that every
patient in the study ``gave clear and unambiguous consent,'' while
the agency found serious lapses in the way the explanation of
benefits and risks was documented.
</P>
<P>
   While the scientists acknowledged they were two to three months
late in telling the food and drug agency about serious side effects
experienced by other patients, the scientists said they did provide
the information _ which the agency could have used to stop the
study _ six months before Gelsinger's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were what we believe to be largely minor breaches of
filing forms at particular times, but those in no way contributed
to this unfortunate and tragic event,'' said Dr. Richard L. Tannen,
senior vice dean of the university's medical school, in an
interview Monday. ``Based on our retrospective, careful in-house
review, we have not found any evidence at all that things would
have been changed if these minor deviations had not occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Tannen said the university was hoping the report would help
persuade the agency to lift its suspension of gene therapy
experiments, but whether that would happen anytime soon was
unclear. A spokesman for the food and drug agency, Lawrence
Bachorik, said only that the agency had received the report and
would review it as part of its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still weighing our options and there are many options,''
he said. Although he declined to be more specific, the agency could
take a number of steps, ranging from no further action to issuing a
warning letter, or in the most serious case, prohibiting scientists
from participating in future research.
</P>
<P>
   As far as government officials know, Gelsinger, who died on
Sept. 17, is the first person killed by gene therapy. His death has
triggered intense scrutiny of the decade-old field, and has raised
questions about whether federal oversight is adequate. Earlier this
month, the National Institutes of Health said that gene therapy
scientists had routinely ignored federal guidelines for reporting
side effects for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, questions were raised about another study, this
one at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., in
which children with brain cancer may have been inadvertently
exposed to the viruses that cause AIDS and hepatitis during a gene
therapy experiment. In that case, the principal investigator has
said the possibility that any children were harmed was
``infinitesimally small.''
</P>
<P>
   But an advocate for patients complained that both the St. Jude
scientist and the Penn response Monday played down the failings of
the experiments. ``Biomedical researchers have a tendency to
trivialize their violations,'' said Vera Hassner Sharav, president
of Citizens for Responsible Care and Research, a New York-based
advocacy group. ``That is precisely why we need independent checks
and balances that are mandated by federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tannen, the Penn report was prepared by university
scientists, including Dr. James Wilson, the principal investigator
of the study and the director of the university's Institute for
Human Gene Therapy, and was reviewed by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   No suit has been filed in connection with the death, although
Paul Gelsinger, Jesse's father, has hired a lawyer. The lawyer,
Alan Milstein, said Monday that he found the university's response
``incredible, in light of the findings of the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger suffered a fatal immune reaction while participating
in a study of the safety of a treatment for ornithine
transcarbamylase deficiency, a hereditary disorder from which he
suffered. When the food and drug agency investigated the
experiment, it found 18 failings in the way the scientists followed
rules designed to protect patients from harm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most serious allegations was that Gelsinger should
never have been treated because his blood ammonia levels were too
high on the day before the therapy, an infusion of corrective
genes, was administered. But the Penn scientists said Monday that
Gelsinger's ammonia levels had fluctuated, and added that there
were no specific requirements that they be at a certain level on
the date of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also found that the researchers waited until after
Gelsinger died to fill out eligibility forms for the patients in
the study _ a finding the Penn team said had been misinterpreted to
suggest the group was covering its tracks. The Penn team said the
forms were developed and filled out as part of an internal review
of the death.
</P>
<P>
   Those forms will now become standard fare in Penn gene therapy
experiments, said Tannen, adding that the university will also
develop a manual of standard operating procedures _ a document the
FDA said should have been in place all along. He said he hoped the
procedural changes would be complete within the next month to six
weeks. In the meantime, a team of independent scientists, appointed
by Dr. Judith Rodin, Penn's president, is also reviewing the gene
therapy institute's work.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the institute, with a $25 million annual budget and
some 250 employees, could have operated without such standards,
Tannen said, ``It wasn't that they weren't carefully following what
they were doing. It was just that, in truth, in regard to those
issues, they could have done better.''

 &HT;    Baby born after twister
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMEGA _ A baby boy was in critical condition in a Macon hospital
after a tornado caused his premature birth.
</P>
<P>
   The infant _ called ``Miracle Baby Varnadoe'' by his family _
was delivered by emergency C-section early Monday after his
20-year-old mother was taken to Tift General Hospital in Tifton.
Jenny Varnadoe, her husband, Buck, 22, and two children were inside
their mobile home when a twister touched down on Mitchell Store
Road around 1:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny was in her 28th week of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The house was blown from its base and landed on the road,
injuring the couple, 2-year-old Bud and 3-year-old Britney. The
couple and two children remained hospitalized Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up to check on them and found them outside in their
car,'' said a cousin, Danny Varnadoe. ``They were in real bad
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Another cousin, Lee Varnadoe, said the doctors at Tift decided
to take the baby because the boy's heart rate ``went way high.''
</P>
<P>
   The newborn was airlifted by helicopter to Medical Center of
Central Georgia because of its neo-natal intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in luck,'' the family said in a statement.
``The praise for our children still being alive goes to God.''

 &HT;    From Atlanta with love: Spano toast of the town
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was no surprise that on Valentine's Day, Atlanta's
new conductor stole a few hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spano, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra's newly appointed
music director, blew into town from an opera-conducting gig in
Wales for a celebratory round of toasts and introductions Sunday
night and Monday. Hopscotching among a champagne reception, a press
conference and a marathon run of meetings and greetings, Spano
confessed that he'd had a crush on the ASO long before the match
was finally made last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I want to cancel everything on the schedule, and I
want to be here,'' Spano told a captive champagne-swigging clutch
of ASO musicians, board members, staffers and patrons at the Four
Seasons Hotel on Sunday night. Gesturing toward giant posters of
himself that decorated the front of the room, he deadpanned that
his mother told him never to get a ``big head.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a whirlwind tour in which the 38-year-old maestro seemed
genuinely humbled by the outpouring of affection.
</P>
<P>
   He sang ``America the Beautiful'' at the Downtown Rotary Club
meeting. He greeted Donald Runnicles, the ASO's new principal guest
conductor, via Internet camera hookup. He got e-mail from Atlanta
Mayor Bill Campbell. He tossed a bouquet to ASO concertmaster
Cecylia Arzewski by scratching the Wagner scheduled for the May 4-6
concerts in favor of Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Sheherazade,'' a star turn
for the violinist. And, at a Georgia Citizens for the Arts luncheon
Monday, he was introduced by Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, who filled in
after Gov. Roy Barnes was called away to the South Georgia tornado
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most significantly, Spano praised ASO music director
Yoel Levi, whom he replaces in September. ``This orchestra is
excellent, and there's no way they would be that without Mr. Levi's
stewardship over the last 12 years,'' Spano said later.
``Orchestras tend to reflect their music director, and this
orchestra is a really refined instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is committed to taking the ASO on tour _ and to
building a new Symphony Hall. ``We are going to find a way to make
that happen. An orchestra of this caliber blossoms in a hall that
is meant specifically for orchestral music, and that should happen
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Spano also invited the public to give him feedback before he
even gets started. ASO board Chairman A.D. Frazier Jr. presented
him with a new laptop computer _ and a Woodruff Arts Center e-mail
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they say in the movies, `You've got e-mail,''' Frazier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, when he logged on for Spano, there was a big red
heart from the Atlanta Symphony Associates and the mayor's
greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This e-mail stuff isn't half bad,'' the conductor joked.

 &HT;    Bush renews McCain jabs
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALUDA, S.C._ Gov. George W. Bush returned to South Carolina on
Monday and renewed verbal sparring with Arizona Sen. John McCain,
his prime foe in a Saturday primary that could go a long way toward
deciding who gets the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In Anderson, S.C., McCain complained that Bush is intentionally
misrepresenting McCain's record on public funding of congressional
races. McCain has cast five Senate votes in favor of the concept,
though he says he opposes it and cast the votes only as part of
``the essence of legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of savagery is not necessary in an American
political campaign,'' McCain said at a town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush refused to retreat, saying, ``It's not savagery. It's
what we call full exposure, full disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm respectful of his votes. I disagree with his votes. I
think it's important for us in the Republican Party to understand
that our candidate is going to have to weather a savaging attack if
Al Gore is the (Democratic) nominee,'' Bush told reporters. ``The
idea of me pointing out a major difference certainly is not
savaging.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he opposes public funding of congressional
elections, but endorsed it as part of overall reform packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I
will make compromises,'' he said. ``That's the essence of
legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes public funding of congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush and Alan Keyes, the remaining GOP presidential
contenders, meet tonight in Columbia at a debate to be televised by
CNN. It's the last scheduled joint appearance before Saturday's
primary. Polls indicate a tight race. A big win here by either
candidate could have a major effect on Michigan and Arizona
primaries three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, in North Augusta, S.C., Bush repeated his charge
that McCain insulted him by saying he twists the truth ``like
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also continued his new format of extended
question-and-answer sessions with voters. At an event at the
National Guard Armory in Saluda, one man wanted to know what Bush
considers the biggest misconception about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's the perception I can't stand on my own two
feet,'' Bush said, after pausing to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans oftentimes ask am I tough enough to
win,'' he said. ``I guess my answer is just ask Ann Richards.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of three times Monday that Bush pointed to his 1994
win as evidence to his ability to win a tough race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe taking on Ann Richards is going to be tougher than
taking on Al Gore,'' he said at a community center in North
Augusta.

<P>
   IRAQ: U.N. AIDE QUITS
</P>
<P>
   The director of the ``oil for food'' program in Iraq resigned
effective March 31, saying he had lost hope of being able to help
Iraqis living under an embargo imposed in 1990. Hans van Sponeck, a
German, has been sharply criticized by the United States and
Britain for his opposition to the sanctions and to the linking of
resumed arms inspections to the program that allows Iraq to sell
oil to buy civilian goods. Another director who was critical of the
sanctions, Denis Halliday of Ireland, quit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   KUWAIT: INVASION ENVOY PICKED
</P>
<P>
   Yuli Vorontsov, a former Russian delegate to the United Nations
and envoy to the United States, was named a U.N.
undersecretary-general with responsibility for solving the problem
of about 600 missing Kuwaiti prisoners and millions of dollars in
property still unaccounted for from the Iraqi invasion in 1990.

<P>
   ISRAEL: WEIZMAN CHARGES UNLIKELY
</P>
<P>
   The state is unlikely to prosecute President Ezer Weizman for
accepting substantial cash gifts from a French executive, the state
attorney, Edna Arbel, said. The investigation is drawing to a close
and she does not forsee filing charges, she said.

<P>
   BRITAIN: PINOCHET RULING TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   The High Court moved forward its scheduled Thursday ruling to
Tuesday on the demand by Belgium and six rights groups that Britain
disclose the doctors' examination of Gen. Augusto Pinochet that was
the basis for its finding that he was medically unfit to be
extradited to Spain on torture charges. Even if the decision goes
in favor of Chile's former dictator, appeals could further delay a
prompt return home.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN IRELAND: HOME RULE DISCORD
</P>
<P>
   A disagreement between Britain and Ireland emerged over the
urgency of resurrecting the power-sharing home rule government in
Belfast suspended by London. Brian Cowen, Ireland's foreign
minister, urged resumption within 48 hours based on a new
disarmament commitment by the IRA, but Peter Mandelson, secretary
for the province, said more time was needed to clarify the IRA
offer.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY: TROOPS FOR EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Worried that they will be cut out of Europe's future defense
plans because they remain outside the European Union, Turkish
leaders have offered to contribute a brigade to the European
defense force to be formed in 2003. The Turkish brigade would
reportedly be about 3,000 strong. It would be part of a combined
force expected to include about 50,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: IMMIGRANT LABOR DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Moroccans ended their strike and returned to work
in the greenhouses of El Ejido, a week after anti-immigrant
violence led to dozens of injuries and arrests in the town. Local
growers, who reported mounting losses from unpicked vegetables,
agreed to improve housing for the farmworkers and pay for their
damaged property and mosques.

   Voters in the biggest cities rejected a new constitution
championed by President Robert Mugabe that would strengthen the
power of his office and give the government the right to seize
white-owned land without compensation. With ballots tallied from
under half the districts, it was clear that, to be adopted, the new
charter will need a big push from remaining districts, many in
rural areas that are the base of Mugabe's power.

   CONGO: ARMY DRIVE
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Laurent Kabila announced a new
recruiting drive for its army, which has been fighting against
rebel, Rwandan and Ugandan forces despite a cease-fire signed half
a year ago. Kabila has been increasing the size of the military
since the current war began in 1998, in part by enlisting child
soldiers.

   CONGO: PLEA TO REBELS
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has called on rebels in Congo to allow a local

suggestions,'' an assessment prosecutors say they will challenge.
</P>
<P>
   EAST TIMOR: HANDOVER TO U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Australian-led peacekeeping troops pulled out of the capital
city, Dili, handing responsibility for security to United Nations
forces that included troops from Brazil, Portugal and Kenya. The

   MOUNT KUMGANG, North Korea _ The last time Yoon Chun-ok and Yoon
Chun-sook climbed this majestic mountain, which Koreans consider
sacred, was 1948, when the Korean peninsula had not yet been
divided by war.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, just before the North turned communist and
closed its borders, the Yoon family fled south to Seoul, but the
sisters never lost hope of returning to their birthplace and
scaling the summit one more time.
</P>
<P>
   So when North Korea began allowing commercial tours to Mount
Kumgang in late 1998, the sisters signed up. Today not even
advancing age, subzero temperatures or icy paths could keep them
from reaching the mountaintop, which offers a stunning view of
snow-capped peaks, gorges and waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Since North Korea opened parts of Mount Kumgang to South Korean
tourists in November 1998, about 150,000 people have visited the
scenic mountain region north of the eastern end of the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The tours have become the hallmark of South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung's so-called sunshine policy of constructively engaging
North Korea in an effort to hasten reconciliation between the two
nations. While these tours have been a breakthrough in the
long-frozen relations between North and South, they also illustrate
how difficult it would be to reunite the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, as of this month, non-Koreans are allowed to
go on the tours, which provide the only access _ although limited _
to this hermetic, bellicose country where 24 million people live
under a hard-line Stalinist government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been waiting 50 years to come home, and it feels so
good to be back that my body is very warm and peaceful even though
it's freezing cold out here,'' Chun-sook, 68, said as she made the
climb. But Chun-ok, 72, said the homecoming was bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to be back, but our village looks nothing like we
remember,'' she said. ``There are soldiers posted at every corner.
The people don't look happy, and we couldn't get off the bus and
talk to them. Everything has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans are not allowed to travel freely to the North,
because the two countries have no formal relations and are still
technically at war. Under Kim's policy, South Korea has eased
restrictions on doing business with North Koreans and increased its
fertilizer and food aid to the North.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is struggling to rebuild its tattered economy and
feed its starving people, hit hard by food shortages and floods in
recent years, so it is in desperate need of hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for opening parts of the mountain region to tours,
which are operated by Hyundai Co., a South Korean conglomerate,
North Korea is expected to receive hundreds of millions of dollars
in payments over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the North Korean government tightly controls what
visitors to Mount Kumgang see and where they go, the tours provide
a glimpse of what life is like in North Korea, one of the most
isolated and oppressive countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe people are still living under these conditions
in the new millennium,'' said D.L. Kim, a South Korean tourist, who
owns a retail shop in Seoul. ``It breaks my heart to see our Korean
brothers suffering, especially in this place of such great
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   During a trip last weekend, there was a constant uneasy feeling
of being watched, from the time visitors arrived in the North
Korean port of Changjon aboard a Hyundai cruise ship from the South
Korean port of Tonghae.
</P>
<P>
   Navy boats are always on patrol around the cruise ships, and
their crews can enter the tour vessels at any time to search them.
Changjon is a strategic military port for North Korea, and visitors
are forbidden to take photos of any military installation or
personnel. If a tourist breaks that rule, the film may be
confiscated or the offender may be fined or even detained.
</P>
<P>
   After coming ashore and passing through immigration, the
visitors were taken by tour bus through a winding road leading to
the village of Onjongi, once a hot spring resort that is now the
starting point for these Mount Kumgang tours.
</P>
<P>
   The road was lined with barbed-wire fencing and grim-faced North
Korean soldiers wearing green military uniforms and carrying
automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Tour guides said that during the initial tours in 1998, there
were no fences and that tourists often had contact with the
residents of Onjongi. North Korea installed the fences after South
Korean tourists started giving milk, snacks and clothing to the
North Koreans, especially children, who looked malnourished, the
guides said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fences was a bleak landscape of unkempt fields and
rows of prefabricated concrete houses that tour guides said
belonged to farmers. Tour buses and military vehicles were the only
automobiles on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Village residents, in drab black and blue clothing, were walking
or riding bicycles. Most smiled and waved at the tour buses.
</P>
<P>
   On what tour guides described as municipal buildings there were
pictures of President Kim Jung Il, who assumed control of North
Korea after the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, in 1994.
Immigration and other government officials wore small red pins
bearing the image of North Korea's leader.
</P>
<P>
   While tourists have almost no contact with local residents, they
are permitted to speak with North Korean officials, especially the
environmental guards and inspectors who monitor the mountain paths
and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The guards and inspectors were generally friendly and seemed
happy to meet non-Koreans, although most of them did not speak any
English and tried to communicate in Korean or Russian.
</P>
<P>
   But South Korean tourists said they had difficulty speaking with
some North Koreans because they used ``old-fashioned words'' and
did not understand many modern terms like ``instant noodles,''
``compact disc'' and ``microwave oven.''
</P>
<P>
   Some North Korean officials monitoring the mountain trails
reacted with great surprise at meeting this visitor _ a person of
African descent, which they had never encountered before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look like Paul Robeson,'' said a North Korean inspector.
``May I know your country?''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the South Koreans seemed reluctant to go much beyond
niceties, perhaps because of the detention last year of a South
Korean housewife on one of these tours, they said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea accused her of trying to entice a North Korean tour
guide to defect to the South. The official North Korean news agency
quoted her as saying, ``North Korean defectors to South Korea are
leading decent lives and if you come to the South you will live in
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea released her only after the South Korean government
threatened to suspend the cruise tours and the lucrative monthly
payments to the North.

</P>
<P>
   Stiff fines have been imposed on foreigners who fail to abide by
North Korea's rules while on the tour. In recent months, fines have
been levied against foreigners for urinating and smoking in
unauthorized areas, spitting, and throwing items like milk and
snacks from tour buses.
</P>
<P>
   According to the South Korean Unification Ministry, North Korea
has collected $8,250 in fines for 290 rules violations in Mount
Kumgang since the start of the tours in 1998. The fines ranged from
$15 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean tour guides said they often have to negotiate with
North Korean guards and monitors to allow some older tourists to
relieve themselves behind bushes or to use lavatories restricted to
military use.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day's tour, visitors return to the cruise
ships, where they spend the night in considerable luxury compared
with the residents of Onjongi, the local village, which has no
electric power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish there was something more we could do to change this
situation,'' said Yl Hung-woo, a South Korean tourist, standing on
the brightly lighted deck of the ship. ``But I think these tours to
Mount Kumgang are a good beginning because they remind us that
despite the division of North and South, Koreans are still one
people and share an appreciation for beauty.''

COMMENTARY: THE SILLY-CANDIDATE SHORTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Trump has dropped out of the presidential race. This will
not have any impact on our actual search for a new chief executive,
but it will be a terrible blow to the second-most-important
function of a national election. Which is, of course, comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of ridiculousness has leaked out of the campaign over the
last few days, as people like Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Orrin
Hatch trotted off into the sunset. They at least hung around until
their humor potential was pretty well exhausted. Trump slipped away
so suddenly that we did not even have time to discuss how his hair
has come to resemble some sort of artificially flavored dessert
topping.
</P>
<P>
   The country was enamored of faux candidates like Trump and
Warren Beatty a few months ago, when it looked as though we were in
for 10 or 11 months of Bush vs. Gore and would need all the
diversion we could get. But now we're happily engaged in real,
competitive contests involving people who are actually more or less
qualified for the jobs they seek. Even though none of them have
ever inhabited the same sentence with the term ``his galpal, the
leggy lingerie model,'' I am pretty confident in saying they are
fulfilling all our current needs.
</P>
<P>
   If we want gossip, there's always the New York Senate race.
Hillary Clinton got into trouble last week for failing to leave a
tip at a restaurant where she received a free meal, a mistake Trump
would certainly never have made. ``It's unfortunate people want to
politicize this,'' said her spokesman, in campaignspeak for total
admission of guilt. Clinton's likely opponent, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, responded by leaving his next waitress $60 for a $35
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. George Bush was dashing around South Carolina
attempting to explain how his campaign has managed to spend the
bulk of that fabled $70 million war chest (big tips?) and to
demonstrate that he can ride buses and hold town meetings just as
well as John McCain. In Massachusetts Bush's organization explained
his poor showing in recent polls there by saying that voters had
not yet been exposed to ``the new Bush of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing how fast these things turn around. The new Al Gore, who
by now is the old Al Gore, should soon have as much money as the
new George Bush. Gore's opponent, the same old Bill Bradley, is
coming closer and closer to running as the candidate who has been
endorsed by Michael Jordan _ a political Nike campaign. Bradley,
who is now one of the few males in America who doesn't seem to
enjoy watching basketball, even spent Sunday at the NBA All-Star
Game with his new favorite player.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who used to have the misfortune of falling in with the
wrong politicians whenever he set foot in New York, managed to have
a meeting with the Rev. Al Sharpton that could not have been more
low-key if they'd held it under a Cone of Silence.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Bush and McCain are fighting like cats.
McCain recently withdrew his attack ads, though his forces are
still leading in negative e-mailing to reporters. (``Bush Empties
the Gutters on McCain,'' ``Greenville Mayor's Wife Incensed by Bush
Push Poll.'') But I was pleased to see that they cheerfully gave a
Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, points for creativity when he called
McCain ``a few french fries short of a Happy Meal.''
</P>
<P>
   We have conspiracy theories! The far-right wing, in a unique
reading of McCain's record as a heroic POW in Vietnam, has been
demanding to know whether the senator is some sort of ``Manchurian
candidate.'' And we are certainly looking forward to an
about-to-be-released movie called ``The Skulls,'' in which a thinly
disguised version of Bush's college fraternity runs the nation
through a sinister and occasionally murderous web of political
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who was last an entrepreneurial role model when Beatty
was last a sex symbol, seems superfluous at a moment when there's
so much action. But if the March primaries lead us back to seven
months of Gore-Bush, I'm prepared to take a serious look at that
boomlet for Cybill Shepherd. Or even Ross Perot.

MCCAIN'S UNSCRIPTED STYLE HARKS BACK TO A LESS PARTISAN TIME
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ John McCain often says he wants to imitate his
hero Ronald Reagan and broaden his party's appeal. But it is one of
those odd twists of politics that he is trying to do this by
running against the controlled, high-gloss techniques that Reagan
as much as anyone brought to presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain is still brandishing as his main campaign weapon his
relentless accessibility _ from his freewheeling encounters with
the public to his anything-goes news conferences aboard his bus.
Much of this openness is a way to get free publicity to counter the
financial advantage of his main competitor, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more, McCain drops suggestions that his campaign
style is about something broader _ a half-thought-out effort to
turn back the clock not just on presidential campaigning but on
governance, in search of a more personable, less confrontational
time. As he held town hall meeting after town hall meeting on
Monday, he declared once again that his campaign ``is being run on
vision and hope'' and pledged that ``we're not having anything to
do with negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has told reporters he is convinced that some of the
corrosive antagonism in Washington between press and the White
House during the Clinton years was the result of restricted access
and a dearth of news conferences. Presidents make mistakes, he
contends, ``when they insulate themselves, then the tensions build,
the pressure builds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go back to the days when FDR used to invite
everybody in to the Oval Office for a chat,'' he said one day.
``But you certainly could go back to the Kennedy thing,'' he added,
saying that he would hold weekly news conferences like John
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy in `60,'' McCain said Sunday, drawing a parallel to
his own campaign, ``had the media with him at all times.'' McCain
also remembered how he thought his friend Bob Dole made a terrible
mistake when he started withdrawing from the press in his losing
1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain even thinks the president could borrow from Britain and
institute a version of ``question time'' when the prime minister
has to answer questions from Parliament. He envisions a delegation
from Congress holding weekly televised grillings of the president.
``That kind of exchange would be good for America,'' he said,
``with the full knowledge that the president would be
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this uncontrolled access is a counterpoint to both Reagan
and President Clinton. It was Reagan, the former actor, who
perfected the campaign as video image _ sticking carefully to his
lines and even standing at the exact spot on the floor where his
aides had marked with masking tape to get the perfect camera angle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ran a more open campaign in 1992 and had his own bus
tours. But by 1995, with the public seeing his talks on MTV about
underwear preferences as not befitting the White House, he began
studying video clips of Reagan to learn how to seem more
presidential. His 1996 re-election campaign became just as
scripted, controlled and gauzy as Reagan's.
</P>
<P>
   And in a year of public disillusionment with Clinton, there
seems to be public disillusionment with an arms length campaign
style too.
</P>
<P>
   There was no better sign that McCain's bus rides have captured
the voters' imagination than when he showed up to sign books in
Atlanta on Sunday. Autograph seekers started clambering onto the
bus as if it were a museum exhibit and taking pictures of its
seating areas.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in Congress, McCain was well known among reporters
for returning phone calls and generally answering even the most
pointed questions. And when he began his campaign his aides
consciously used that style to draw contrasts with the race they
guessed Bush would wage: a highly scripted incumbent-style
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what front-runners do,'' John Weaver, the senator's
political director, said, saying the McCain campaign saw their
candidate's counter-style as ``a tactical advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is immutable. McCain remains committed to his campaign
style even though in South Carolina, the drives on the ``Straight
Talk Express'' can stretch two or three hours. The candidate and
the press journey limbo-like between stops _ in a more
claustrophobic closeness than ever existed on the shorter jaunts
around New Hampshire. McCain can get testy and reporters simply run
out of anything to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, there are whole days when the entire Republican
presidential race seems to revolve not around issues like health
care or foreign policy but on questions of how political campaigns
should be waged. In some ways this is because, except on tax cuts,
there are not large ideological differences between Bush and
McCain. And so campaign style as a measure of character has come to
the fore.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's signature drive to ban big money from politics is only
a part of it. He says over and over that his mission is to end the
cynicism that keeps young people from voting. And last Friday,
McCain announced unilaterally that after a week of harsh, televised
attacks by the two campaigns, he would no longer run negative ads.
The decision seemed cathartic, lightening his mood. He cried out
against the technique of push-polling as the ``real bottom fishing
of a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of this may have been needed repositioning. McCain was
running a harsh ad against Bush last week and had others ready to
go if necessary. But there were signs that the tactic was hurting
his image as a reformer. And, given the tight nature of the race,
he could not risk turning off voters, particularly Democrats and
independents, through a negative-toned campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain also said he was moved by a woman, Donna Duren,
who stood in one of his audiences last Thursday and told how her
teen-age son had been distraught when he received a polling call
telling him that McCain was a fraud. ``I'm not so jaded and old and
hardened and stupid,'' McCain said. ``Something like that mother
the other day impacted me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign too has become preoccupied with the conduct of
politics _ McCain's conduct that is. Day after day the governor or
his surrogates dig up some past statements of McCain's or
contradictory votes by the senator, to try to portray him as a
hypocrite on his signature issue of campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always judge where a politician is going by where
they've been,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, charging
that McCain on campaign finance reform has ``a very long record of
saying one thing and doing another.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator countered Monday that his votes reflect the
give-and-take of congressional compromise. ``I'm not going to let
the perfect be the enemy of the good,'' McCain said. ``I will make
compromises; that's the essence of legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in Saturday's South Carolina primary,
McCain may at least be able to say that he's had some measure of
success in changing politics.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson Bush seems to have drawn from his drubbing in New
Hampshire is that, even as others proclaimed him inevitable, he was
never accessible. So across South Carolina, Bush has been
proclaiming himself a ``reformer with results,'' holding town hall
meetings and even running a bus _ though he has not been holding
the long, free-form news conferences that his rival holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wonderful,'' the senator said of news that Bush had a
campaign bus. ``That would be a great thing for American
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He was only half kidding.

 &HT;    Havoc was ripe in the sky
 &HT;    By Mike Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in
Tallahassee had plenty of warning that the storms bearing down on
the southwest corner of the state early Monday could be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was because atmospheric conditions were ``just right'' for
an outbreak of tornadoes, said meteorologist Matt Volkmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a strong upper-level trough, and a strong upper-level
jet stream moving into South Georgia,'' Volkmer said. ``Coupled
with that, at the surface we had a moist, southerly flow off the
Gulf of Mexico which brought a lot of low-level moisture across the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the low-level moisture, an upper-level system
and some colder air aloft working in as well, and when the wind
direction is changing at different heights, it can create an
environment that will support rotating thunderstorms, and those can
cause tornadoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The string of thunder cells spawned several killer tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmer said outbreaks of severe weather are common across South
Georgia this time of year. ``In late fall as we get out of the
warmer season and start having some cold fronts come down, and
again in the early spring, those are times when we see a fair
amount of severe weather events.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm system responsible for the deadly tornadoes had a
history of causing damage ``all the way back earlier in the day
Sunday in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee,'' Volkmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the system reached Georgia, high winds and hail
caused scattered damage in much of Alabama, downing trees and
leaving thousands of people without power.
</P>
<P>
   A possible tornado struck south Montgomery County, Ala., downing
power lines, overturning mobile homes and destroying a business.
</P>
<P>
   In Marshall County, a church was blown into the middle of the
road near Boaz, Ala. according to local EMA officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Cullman, Ala., several houses and businesses were damaged and
power lines were downed, a police spokesman said. He said the
damage was ``pretty widespread'' throughout the city but no
injuries had been reported.
</P>
<P>
   As the storms continued to push eastward at speeds of up to 45
mph, the Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma posted a tornado watch
for South Georgia at 6:10 p.m. Sunday, and at 11 p.m. continued the
watch through 5 a.m. Monday, Volkmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tallahassee Weather Service office issued 55 tornado and
severe thunderstorm warnings for specific counties late Sunday and
early Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Doppler radar indicated a possible tornado in southeast
Georgia, Volkmer's office issued a tornado warnings for Mitchell,
Colquitt and southern Worth counties at 12:01 a.m. Monday,
effective through 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmer said preliminary reports showed the Mitchell County
tornado struck south of Camilla about 12:09 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   After devastating areas of southwest Georgia, the weather system
took a turn up the East Coast, Volkmer said, and was threatening
parts of the Carolinas Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's storms were Georgia's deadliest outbreak of tornadoes
since April 16, 1944, when 41 Gainesville residents were killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Weather Service, the counties hit by Monday's
storms are among the state's most tornado-prone
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 through 1998, 23 tornadoes were reported in Colquitt
County. During the same period, Tift County had 17, Mitchell County
16 and Grady County 11, according to the Weather Service.

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Less than a year after the massacre at
Columbine High School, two sophomores were found shot to death on
Monday in a sandwich shop near the school.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were discovered just before 1 a.m. when an employee
of the shop happened to drive by, noticed lights still on almost
three hours after closing time and went inside to see why. The
authorities said she found the bodies behind the counter. They were
later identified as Nicholas Kunselman, 15, an employee of the
shop, and Stephanie Hart, a 16-year-old girl he was dating.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's office, Steve
Davis, said investigators had neither determined a motive for the
shootings nor a time of death, although they ruled out a
murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said they had no suspects but wanted to question a white
male in his late teens or early 20s wearing a red jacket and flared
pants, whom the employee said she saw leaving the area when she
arrived. He said investigators were also reviewing videotape from a
surveillance camera inside the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he did not know whether investigators had found money
in the cash register, but one law enforcement official said he did
not believe robbery was the motive and said he would not be
surprised if the killer turned out to be another Columbine student.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings had the immediate effect of reopening the
psychological wounds of 10 months ago, when two Columbine students
shot and killed 12 other students and a teacher and wounded two
dozen other students before killing themselves in what became the
worst of a recent series of shootings at schools around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The incident set in motion scenes that have become all too
familiar in this middle-class community just south of Denver. After
students arriving for classes on Monday morning were told of the
killings, many began crying, and some were so upset they left
school immediately. Several dozen drove to the parking lot near the
sandwich shop to leave flowers, balloons and other mementos and
write messages with chalk on the blacktop. One said, ``Stop the
Hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings also prompted school district officials to react
as they had after the shootings last April, calling in extra
security and mental health workers for students who needed
counseling. When the principal, Frank DeAngelis, walked from the
school to a park, where he read a statement to reporters, he was
accompanied by a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school community hurts a great deal,'' he said. ``We're
trying to keep normalcy at our school.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Romanshyn, an 18-year-old senior, who left school early for
the day, said: ``Lots of kids are really distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   The sandwich shop, a Subway franchise, is less than a half-mile
from the high school and about twice that distance from a Dumpster
where two weeks ago the authorities found the body of an
11-year-old Denver boy, Antonio Davalos, who had been missing for
several days. He had been strangled.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is also less than a block from the Trinity Christian
Center, where several memorial services were held last year for
victims of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not disclose who owned the Subway shop. A
spokeswoman for the company, Annie Smith, said she would not
provide the information.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot, students and former Columbine students
milled around outside an area cordoned off by crime-scene tapes.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Hodack, 22, a 1996 Columbine graduate who works at the
Subway, said that Nicholas was often entrusted with closing the
shop and that Stephanie often came by near closing time to keep him
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really a nice kid,'' Hodack said. ``He made the time to
talk to you, to see how you were doing. He was a really friendly
type.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodack said that if the killings had occurred as part of a
robbery, the gunman would not have gotten much money. Large bills,
he said, are removed from the cash register every hour. ``So the
only thing he possibly got was change or maybe $50,'' he said.
``That's not worth a robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing with a group of friends, Hodack said: ``I don't know
what to make of it. There's been a whole bunch of this stuff _
anger, hate, sadness. We've had enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nathan Grill, 15, a classmate and co-worker of Nicholas', said
he and other friends had been in the shop Sunday night but had left
just before the 10 p.m. closing time as Nicholas was waiting on a
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up this morning, and he's dead,'' Nathan said, shaking
his head. ``I don't know what to think or what to do. There are
just bad people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Scott, 18, also came to the parking lot on Monday.
Stephanie was her cousin. ``She loved school,'' Courtney said.
``She had a lot of friends, she loved sports, like swimming. She
was just a real good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the sheriff's spokesman, said that many of the
investigators at the sandwich shop had worked on the Columbine
killings last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the community hasn't even had time for the first
wounds to heal,'' he said. ``And now, it's pouring salt onto those
wounds. It's traumatic for us.''

CHALLENGE TO SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY IS DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A legal challenge that sought to block
Saturday's Republican presidential primary in South Carolina was
dropped Monday after the state Republican Party agreed to open
every available polling place in the state, including those in
heavily Democratic and black areas that were closed in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   In order to win a federal court's approval to hold the primary,
the state party has spent the last few weeks scrambling to assemble
more than 5,000 volunteers to staff the polling places, far more
than in any previous primary. The party also agreed to pay state
election workers $45 a day to work at polling places where
volunteers cannot be found.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 1,500 polling places will be open on
Saturday, compared with about 800 in 1996. The increased statewide
access in non-Republican areas could make voting easier for
Democrats and independents, many of whom have said they are
planning to support Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the unintended consequences of the lawsuit,
which began last month as a bit of mischief by Democrats in a state
where shoulder pads are a necessary part of the political uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party persuaded two black state legislators to
complain that the Republicans were blocking access to their primary
in mostly black districts. Republicans acknowledged that in
previous years they had not opened polls in areas where Republicans
were not likely to vote, which included black districts because
most blacks in South Carolina are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, of course, were not really interested in creating
greater access to the Republican primary; they mostly wanted to
embarrass and distract the Republicans while the national media
were in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like pulling the fire alarm,'' said Henry
McMaster, chairman of the state Republican party. ``You might be
joking, but the fire department doesn't know that, and it sets off
serious consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   After complaining to the Justice Department that the Republican
primary violated the federal Voting Rights Act, the Democrats
realized they too would be unable to open all polling places in the
state. So they canceled their primary on March 9, which was too
late to be of consequence in the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   (They will instead hold a rather inconsequential caucus on March
9, another reason that many Democrats may vote in the far more
crucial Republican contest.)
</P>
<P>
   But Lee Parks, the Atlanta lawyer retained by the Democrats, who
normally brings lawsuits against affirmative-action programs,
pressed on with the lawsuit in federal court, forcing the
Republicans to make a massive effort to recruit volunteers and even
pay state workers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement between the two sides was approved Monday by a
panel of three federal judges here. The Justice Department also
issued a separate opinion Monday saying that the primary meets the
requirements of the Voting Rights Act because of the number of
polling places that will be open.
</P>
<P>
   Several state legislators have said they will now seek to have
the state government supervise the administration of party
primaries, as is done in almost every other state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Harpootlian, the chairman of the state Democratic party,
said the lawsuit was worth it, and not just because of the pleasure
of watching his opponents spend a great deal of effort and possibly
money to hold their primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Republican candidates go around the country claiming
they want an inclusive party for all races and creeds,'' he said,
``we were able to show that in South Carolina, where the rubber
meets the road, they only opened up polling places in minority
areas when they were facing the threat of a federal court
intervening or shutting down their primary.''
</P>
<P>
   But McMaster bravely insisted that the effort had backfired on
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw their voters drifting away to us, and tried to stop
our primary,'' he said. ``But what really happened is that their
lawsuit created more interest and more publicity about the primary.
And I think they're just sick about it.''

<P>
   The price of crude oil jumped to more than $30 a barrel Monday
for the first time since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and a sharp
runup in gasoline prices looks increasingly likely this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil neared $30 in mid-January, slipped and
then rallied again last week. All the time, traders were weighing
concerns about declining inventories of crude oil, home heating oil
and gasoline against the possibility of a production increase from
major oil producers when they meet at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   As new data showed some inventories tightening last week, only
promises of increased production by unnamed OPEC officials kept the
price of crude oil from piercing $30.
</P>
<P>
   But several reports Monday put a damper on the prospect of a
production increase, and the $30 barrier was breached. The price of
crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
jumped 81 cents to $30.25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, new comments from OPEC officials holding out the hope
of production increases could depress the price again. In fact,
Monday's comments contradicted what appeared to be clear signals
last week that Venezuela and Saudi Arabia would ask for an increase
by June at a meeting of OPEC countries at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the producers relent, the production cuts that began
last March _ equal to 4.3 million barrels a day _ may have already
set the stage for a sharp rise in gasoline prices later this year
and a stronger political response from the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If OPEC eases in June, it's too late,'' said Irene King,
senior oil markets analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities, referring to
peak gasoline demand in the summer travel season. Because of the
lag time between increased crude oil production and the refining of
gasoline, she said, ``we will have to go through all the holidays
with very low gasoline inventories. That would make the heating oil
squeeze we had a few weeks ago look like a piece of cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail gasoline prices, according to the Department of Energy,
rose to $1.356 a gallon this week, up 48 percent in the last year
and the highest since late 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the futures market, the price of unleaded gasoline for March
delivery rose 2.3 cents Monday to 83.41 cents a gallon. Gasoline is
now well above the price of home heating oil, which rose 1.5 cents
to 75.70 a gallon Monday. But it is far below the 95.20 a gallon
price of Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has no plans now to dip into
the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve, although he is
being pressured to do so by Northeastern politicians, including
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. A spokesman for the Energy Department
said Monday that this was ``not an option in the current
environment and the last four words are key.'' While the weather
has moderated for now in the Northeast, reducing concern about home
heating oil inventories, gasoline prices could be thrust into the
spotlight as the California presidential primary nears.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is scheduled to meet with energy officials in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait at the end of the month but had to cancel a
meeting with Venezuelan oil officials because of a scheduling
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating what OPEC _ and the price of oil _ is going to do
is complex in part because of politics, both in OPEC and the United
States. The Iranian elections are this week, and some analysts have
said that OPEC wants to look determined to bolster oil prices to
help moderates win there. An OPEC that bowed to the West by
increasing production, analysts argue, could be used against the
moderates. In addition, the United States does not want to threaten
Saudi Arabia and lose its support, which could happen if the
Clinton administration dipped into the the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that OPEC members would argue for a
production increase once the price of crude topped $30 a barrel and
world inventories fell. At this point, they may find it easier to
persuade members that a modest production increase of about 1
million barrels a day would not send crude oil prices tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   But even if this is the goal, analysts say, OPEC leaders like
Saudi Arabia do not want oil prices to climb too quickly. A sharp
rise could prompt a stronger reaction from U.S. and European
leaders who have to worry about the impact of higher prices on
consumers, voters and the economy. So the recent comments from OPEC
officials may have been intended to keep the price of crude oil
from rising too fast.
</P>
<P>
   A report from Venezuela helped jar the oil market Monday, said
James R. Steel, energy analyst at Refco Inc. Alvaro Silva, the vice
oil minister of Venezuela, told Dow Jones Newswires that there were
no plans to ask for a crude oil production increase at the March
OPEC meeting. His comments contradicted the signal Friday of a
production increase from an unnamed Venezuelan official. Dow Jones
also reported that Shokri Ghanem, the director of OPEC's research
division, said that ``support is growing among OPEC members for an
extension of the cuts'' beyond March. And over the weekend, Iraq
repeated its threats to cut its oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really pouring cold water on this idea that took hold
last week that Saudi Arabia would allow a production increase,''
said Steel.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp decline in inventories of crude oil and products
showed up in a report by the International Energy Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that oil inventories among the 29 countries in
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were at
the lowest month-end level since February 1997 and the lowest
year-end level in a decade. ``Without more oil from producers who
are limiting output,'' the report said, ``the first quarter
stockdraw will be even larger, increasing the risks of spot outages
and price volatility.''

NEW EMPHASIS IN CANCER DRUG TESTS: THE ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Every winter in the frigid town of South Bend, Ind., Dr. Rafat
Ansari notices a definite increase in the number of his breast
cancer patients who choose to have mastectomies rather than
lumpectomies. The reason, he says, is quite simple.
</P>
<P>
   While the two treatments are equally effective in early breast
cancer, there are considerations that go beyond the medical, Ansari
said. With a mastectomy, in which a woman's entire cancerous breast
is removed, once the surgery is done, the treatment is complete.
</P>
<P>
   But women who have lumpectomies, in which just the cancerous
tumor is taken out, must have six weeks of radiation treatments.
For many of Ansari's patients, elderly women living alone and
afraid to go out on the icy roads, the thought of the daily trek to
a radiation center is simply too much. They choose to have the
breast removed instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These little old ladies will tell you, `Six weeks of radiation
treatments? I'm not driving,''' said Ansari, a cancer specialist in
private practice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complication that was hardly dreamed of in the 1980s
when cancer researchers triumphantly announced that many women with
small tumors did not need to have mastectomies. But the large
national study that established this, like nearly every other
cancer study until now, had virtually no patients over 65.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what they say is an unprecedented initiative, cancer
researchers are designing studies specifically for older people.
The new approach, these researchers say, is forcing them to ask a
different sort of question. Instead of seeking the most aggressive
treatments, intended to keep cancer at bay for decades, they are
looking for the mildest treatments for people whose life expectancy
may be no more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That means asking whether radiation after lumpectomy extends
life for older women with breast cancer, whether chemotherapy is
helpful for elderly patients with colon cancer, lung cancer or
breast cancer, and whether mild chemotherapy is helpful for elderly
lung-cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer researchers say there is a great need for studies
focusing on the elderly. The typical cancer patient is not a parent
with school-age children, but a grandmother or grandfather living
alone or in a nursing home. For example, while a woman of 35 has a
one in 2,500 risk of developing breast cancer in the next year, a
75-year-old woman's risk is closer to one in 300, noted Dr. Hyman
Muss, a professor of medicine at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the aging of our population, the average cancer patient
is going to be 70 years old,'' said Dr. Bruce Chabner, the clinical
director of the cancer center at the Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston. ``But the average patient in clinical trials is 45 or
50.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger patients often want, and can tolerate, extremely
aggressive treatments. With decades of life before them, they have
every incentive to go to any length to try to wipe their cancers
out. That is why many have sought bone marrow transplants, a
regimen that used doses of chemotherapy drugs so high that only the
youngest and healthiest patients could survive them.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a suitable treatment for an 80-year-old woman with
heart disease or kidney disease or emphysema. Nor was it in demand
among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often people in this age group do not want aggressive
treatment,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Abrams, who coordinates breast cancer
trials at the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first attempts to address the needs of elderly cancer
patients was a study, sponsored by the cancer institute, that was
designed to help patients like Ansari's: If a patient is 70 or
older when breast cancer is discovered, can she get away with just
a lumpectomy and hormonal therapy with the anti-estrogen drug
tamoxifen? Are those six weeks of radiation really necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Another study, in which Chabner is participating, involves lung
cancer patients who are 70 and older, testing a mild chemotherapy
regimen with the drug taxol. ``It's relatively easy to take, and
nontoxic,'' Chabner said.
</P>
<P>
   But the breast cancer trial showed the way, cancer experts said.
Abrams said that an impetus for the trial was the cancer
institute's own data. Elderly women were not having lumpectomies.
Some researchers thought doctors were encouraging mastectomies
because they did not think older women cared about their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams said that often the women themselves were refusing
lumpectomies because of the problem of getting to a radiation
therapy center, or other medical problems that made radiation
therapy difficult for them.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Rahfeldt, an 84-year-old widow who lives alone in La
Porte, Ind., said she refused to consider radiation therapy when
she discovered a lump in her breast last December. It was not just
the inconvenience of radiation treatments, she said. She also
worried about her pacemaker. She did not want to have it removed
and reset after the radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor told her that her only option then was a mastectomy.
``I told him that if it came to that and it would be my life, then
to take the breast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer specialists said their elderly patients often refused
lumpectomies. Muss said: ``I have had patients who said, `Look,
dear, I live out in the country and I would be a tremendous burden
_ I prefer to have the mastectomy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Hughes, director of the breast center at the Lahey
Clinic in Burlington, Mass., observed, ``You very seldom run into a
50-year-old woman who says, `I don't want radiation therapy because
I can't drive back and forth.''' But, he added, ``For older women,
it was a recurring theme.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason to question the necessity of radiation for
elderly breast cancer patients, said Dr. Donald Berry, chairman of
the department of biostatistics at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston. Older women, he explained, tend to have less
aggressive, slower-growing tumors. And they often have other
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has breast cancer at age 70, they are probably not
going to die of breast cancer,'' Berry said. ``They're going to die
of something else.'' So he and others asked what is the gentlest
way to treat these patients and still give them the best chance of
surviving their cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lauren Schnaper, a surgeon who directs the comprehensive
breast care center at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, wrote
the protocol for the lumpectomy study, along with Hughes. But she
soon found that few doctors told their elderly patients that the
study was an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to convince physicians to enter their patients in
the study,'' Schnaper said. ``They told me it was a controversial
question.'' But Schnaper and others made persuading doctors their
mission, traveling to medical meetings and repeatedly urging
doctors to enroll patients.
</P>
<P>
   After five years, the researchers reached their goal: enrolling
640 women who were 70 or older when their breast cancers were
discovered and who had small tumors that had not spread beyond
their breasts. The women were randomly assigned to have a
lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy or lumpectomy alone. All
the women took tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is just a matter of waiting one to three years to see if
there is a difference in outcome between the women who had
radiation and those who did not.

   Until the results are in, Abrams stressed, it is not known
whether older women can forgo radiation treatments after a
lumpectomy. ``We don't know the answer to the question yet and so
it remains unproven,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, researchers are moving to other questions of
particular interest to the elderly _ chemotherapy, for instance,
which was tested, once again, in populations that were
overwhelmingly middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemotherapy saves lives, but is it worth giving it to a woman
over 70?'' asked Muss. His group, he said, is designing trials in
elderly breast cancer patients to find out.

US TO RECOMMEND RELEASE OF TERRORISM SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The federal government will recommend Tuesday the
release of Lucia Garofalo, arrested for illegal entry into the
United States Dec. 19, because ``it is evident she has no
connection to terrorism,'' according to her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to dispel any notion that my client struck a deal, that
she is cooperating with the government by exchanging information
for her release,'' the attorney, Maryanne Kampmann said. ``This
simply is not so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For my client's safety, it is imperative that the public
understand she has struck no deal with the goverment,'' Kampmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Charles Tetzlaff declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kampmann said prosecutors will recommend Garafolo's release at a
hearing scheduled for 1:30 p.m. in US District Court in Burlington,
Vt. Judge William K. Sessions III is scheduled to preside, and will
have the final word on the government petition.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be ``somewhat bureaucratic'' should Judge
Sessions agree to the release, Kampmann said. Because Garofalo is
being held on charges of immigration violation, she will be
detained by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service for
perhaps a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really just a matter of red tape,'' Kampmann said.
</P>
<P>
   As to why her client was arrested for attempting to smuggle a
man with an altered French passport at a remote border crossing _
and had a record of appearing at other remote crossings with other
men at odd hours of the early morning _ Kampman said: ``This will
all become clear at (Tuesday's) hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year old Garofalo, who lives in Montreal and has two
daughters, was arrested Dec. 19 and charged with trying to bring an
Algerian national named Bouabide Chamchi into the United States at
Beecher Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors later alleged that ``it is likely that her actions
were taken on behalf of an Algerian terrorist organization or
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her arrest came just five days after another Algerian, Ahmed
Ressam, was taken into custody in a rental car near Seattle trying
to smuggle a trunkful of explosives from Canada into the United
States. The incidents led authorities to speculate terrorists might
have been targeting New Year's Eve celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, a federal grand jury handed up a nine-count
indictment charging Ressam with conspiring ``to destroy or damage
structures, conveyances or other real or personal property within
the United States.'' Ressam, whose trial is scheduled to begin July
10, has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of an association between Ressam and Garofalo were
based on something akin to telephone tag, but the police took
possible links seriously. On Dec. 14 _ the day of the Seattle
arrests _ Garofalo used her mobile phone to call a mobile phone
belonging to a man in Queens _ whose calls to another mobile phone
led to one Abdel Ghani.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani, of Brooklyn, N.Y., has been charged with being Ressam's
co-conspirator.

 &HT;    World Access extends European reach with three deals
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ World Access took another step Monday toward becoming
a major player in international telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company announced the $900 million purchase of
Communication TeleSystems International, which does business as
WorldxChange. At the same time, World Access announced both an
agreement to purchase Star Telecommunications for $500 million and
the closing of the $185 million purchase of Long Distance
International. The companies had previously signed a letter of
intent on the Star purchase.
</P>
<P>
   All three purchased companies have strength in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The series of acquisitions is in line with Chairman and Chief
Executive John D. ``Jack'' Phillips' goal of quickly growing into a
world-class competitor _ especially in Europe _ by offering a
bundle of local, long-distance and data services. Phillips compares
Europe's deregulated telecom business to the U.S. long-distance
markets several years ago, when changes in the rules lured hundreds
of competitors to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than a decade for the U.S. long-distance industry
to consolidate into the hands of just a handful of companies.
Europe is moving faster than that, he said. ``I think this whole
thing could be over in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   That projection has spurred urgency at World Access, and the
company's buying binge is not finished, he said. ``By the end of
the year, depending on negotiations and how much (regulators) slow
us down, we are looking to be twice the size we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the three most recent deals will give the
company annual sales of about $2.5 billion. World Access had
revenues of just $152 million in 1998, before its shopping spree
began.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, World Access bought FaciliCom International, a
provider of long-distance services in Europe, for $740 million. At
the time, Phillips promised to ratchet up the company's growth
through more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The company also recently moved to focus on telecom services and
leave the equipment business. To that end, World Access has shed
its $250 million-a-year equipment group, which includes Telco
Systems of Massachusetts and Utah-based NACT Switching. An
Alpharetta unit is also being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Facilicom gave World Access a Europeanwide network. Star
provides a solid base inside Germany while WorldxChange has
strength within Britain. Meanwhile, LDI provides a large customer
base, Phillips said. ``This fast-forwards us about two years.''
</P>
<P>
   World Access is 8 percent owned by MCI WorldCom, a
Mississippi-based telecom giant that was built in similar fashion
through a series of takeovers as it became the second-largest
long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   World Access has about 400 employees. The companies being
purchased have 1,500. Shaping a cohesive work force is the greatest
challenge now, Phillips said. ``The hardest thing is always
integration. A network doesn't have a mind of its own. People do.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will hold a strong network with a solid customer
base and sales staff, he said.
</P>
<P>
   World Access now has a high-speed network in the United States
and 13 European countries linked by fiber-optic lines, and it does
business in 200 countries. World Access has already more than
tripled in size during the past year thanks to acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based WorldxChange has switching facilities in 12
countries, mostly Europe, as well as Australia and New Zealand. The
company has revenue of about $600 million a year. As part of the
takeover, WorldxChange shareholders will receive 31 million shares
of World Access stock. World Access will also assume $225 million
of debt held by WorldxChange. WorldxChange will also be given the
right to elect one director to the World Access board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second
quarter but is subject to regulatory approval, as well as that of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Star is also pegged to a stock transfer.
Owners of Star stock will see each of their shares converted to
.3905 of a share in World Access.
</P>
<P>
   World Access stock dipped $1.12 1/2 to close at $21.75 a share
Monday.

LEARNING MICRODISPLAY ABCS: LCD, OLED AMONG
COMPETING  TECHNOLOGIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The silicon-based microdisplays used in inViso's near-eye devices
are only one component in an alphabet soup of new technologies
bidding for a share of of the fast-growing display market.
<P>
   &UR; FED.  &LR; One alternative long touted as a possible replacement for
conventional cathode-ray tube (CRT) and liquid-crystal display
(LCD) technologies for desktop monitors is called field-emission
display (FED). Its chief proponent, San Jose's Candescent
Technologies, has attracted support from several industry
heavyweights: It has investments from Compaq and technology
alliances with Hewlett-Packard and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology has proven more difficult to bring to market
than originally expected, and many industry players have given up
hope for it. Since its founding in 1991, Candescent has already
spent nearly $300 million on the technology, which it calls
ThinCRT, and a company backgrounder on its Web site estimates that
``the journey to initial volume production will require an
additional $500 million.'' Privately, one securities analyst who
follows the display market called the company a ``black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OLED.  &LR; The hottest new technology on the display scene today is
OLED, for organic light-emitting diode. More than 80 companies are
currently  &LR; working on it, according to analyst David Mentley of
Stanford Resources in San Jose, and the list includes such
behemoths as Dupont, Kodak and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the small, gray-green LED screens familiar in everything
from calculators to microwave ovens, OLED screens will be bright
and colorful. And, proponents say, they'll be manufacturable simply
by spraying the necessary circuitry onto rolls of plastic in
machines that are something of a cross between an inkjet printer
and a web CQ-w is lower case &LR; printing press. If that comes to pass,
it will give OLED screens at least two advantages, especially for
mobile devices: They'll be ultracheap and ultrathin.
</P>
<P>
   As with LCD, OLED will come in both active-matrix and
passive-matrix variants. Sanyo, the Japanese electronics-maker,
recently showed a 3-inch active-matrix OLED display it developed in
cooperation with Kodak. Motorola last month announced plans to use
passive-matrix OLED screens, co-developed with Pioneer, in future
Web-enabled cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst Barry Young of DisplaySearch of Austin,
Texas, passive-matrix OLED screens aren't suitable to devices much
larger than cell phones or personal digital assistants, because
they're limited to 240 rows of vertical resolution, half that of
the lowest-resolution notebook-computer displays. But Young said
these screens will be very appealing for small devices because
they're much brighter and more responsive than passive-matrix LCDs,
yet ``very cost-effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Other, still more exotic display technologies _ including use of
plastic transistors recently announced by Lucent Technologies _ are
further out on the high-tech horizon.
</P>
<P>
   With demand for screens, especially for mobile devices, expected
to soar in the next few years, investors are hungry for
opportunities to invest in the display industry, according to
Theodore O'Neill, senior research analyst at Needham &AMP; Co. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for just about anything that breathes in the
display sector, in terms of institutional investor interest,
couldn't be better right now,'' he said, during a presentation
entitled ``Why Wall Street is Betting on Displays'' at an industry
conference in San Jose earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is convinced that new technologies will
have the mobile market to themselves. DisplaySearch's Young noted
that the technology that dominates the market for notebook-computer
screens _ active-matrix LCD, also known as ``TFT'' _ has been
improving at rapid rates in recent years and that costs are
expected to decline by 50 percent over the next three or four years
as new production capacity coming online in Asia alleviates recent
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to bet,'' Young said, ``you have to bet on
TFT.''
</P>
<P>
   From a regional perspective, success for any of the new
technologies would mean a larger role for U.S. companies in the
display industry. A few American companies, such as Photon
Dynamics, a San Jose maker of test equipment for display
manufacturers, and Supertex, a Sunnyvale maker of chips used in
displays, have carved out profitable niches around the periphery of
the industry, but most of it has long since moved to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Within the United States, the Bay Area doesn't dominate what's
left of the display industry the way it does in, say,
semiconductors and Web development; in fact, many of the companies
working on advanced display technologies are located in Oregon,
Austin or the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Display Consortium, an organization created and
originally funded by the Clinton administration to revive the
industry in this country, has set up shop in San Jose. And Philips
Flat Display Systems, one of the world's largest makers of
flat-panel screens, also chose to make San Jose its headquarters,
even though its parent company is Dutch and most of its
manufacturing facilities (bolstered by a recent partnership with
Korea's LG Electronics) are in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, according to Steve Franzese, the Philips division's
vice president of marketing, is that in terms of new uses for
display technology, ``the Bay Area is where the action is.''

UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL: TINY NEW SCREENS GIVE WEB SURFERS THE BIG 
 PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; How do you fit a screen big enough for surfing the World Wide
Web into a device sufficiently petite to slip into your pocket?
<P>
   So far, you don't. Today's ``Web-enabled'' cell phones and the
wireless Palm VII don't let you surf the way you do from your
desktop; instead, they reduce the riches of the Web to a few lines
at a time of colorless text.
</P>
<P>
   But a new technology called microdisplay could change all that
soon if the companies developing it can work out the kinks _ and if
users prove willing to put on glasses or peer through a
microscopelike eyepiece to get the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   While the microdisplay rubric encompasses a variety of
approaches, they all share a basic principle: They uncouple the
size of the image the eye perceives from the dimensions of the
device that generates that image.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the application, the physical device can range in
size from just a few millimeters to a few inches, but it can create
an image with resolution comparable to that of a conventional
desktop computer monitor. To be readable, that image must then be
magnified, but that can be done with optics that add only a little
weight and bulk.
</P>
<P>
   The net result: You put on a pair of special glasses, or hold up
a handheld device an inch in front of your eye, and you see the
equivalent of a 19-inch monitor that is 21/2 two and half &LR;   &LR; feet in
front of you.
</P>
<P>
   Two such products, developed by a Sunnyvale startup named inViso
CQ &LR; , were displayed earlier this month at DAPPCON 2000, a
display-industry conference and trade show in San Jose. The
glasses, which inViso calls eShades, are designed to be connected
to a laptop computer, portable DVD player or other video source.
The other product, eCase, is a Windows CE-based personal digital
assistant with a built-in viewer designed to be held up to the
user's eye.
</P>
<P>
   According to inViso, both products will be ready for volume
production  &UR; Privacy &LR; . Whether viewed through glasses or held up to
the eye, microdisplays will deliver a degree of privacy standard
screens can't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, inViso is developing a credit-card-size PC Card that
could be used to connect its glasses to a current notebook
computer. That would allow business travelers packed into a crowded
plane to work on their spreadsheets when passengers reclining in
the seat in front of them make it impossible to open their
clamshell computer completely _ or watch X-rated DVDs without
worrying about the prying eyes of passenger in the next seat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price &LR; . Once they go into volume production, microdisplays
should be far cheaper to make than conventional screens.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because inViso's ``OptiScape'' displays are based,
quite literally, on semiconductors: They're manufactured by placing
tiny liquid crystals _ similar to those used in LCD screens for
notebooks and flat-panel monitors _ right on a silicon chip. That
means scores or even hundreds of them could be made from a single
silicon wafer.
</P>
<P>
   This technology, known as liquid crystal on silicon or LCOS, is
only one of a variety of approaches used to manufacture
microdisplays. And near-eye optics aren't the only way to scale the
miniature images they generate to a usable size _ several vendors
already use the technology in meeting-room systems that project
images up to 100 inches in size, and both Samsung and JVC
demonstrated pending upcoming  &LR; rear-projection televisions at last
month's Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Computer giants such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and IBM have all
explored the use of this technology for desktop displays, although
so far it hasn't proven cost-effective compared to well-established
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   (For an overview of the whole multifaceted microdisplay
category, see  &LR; www.mdreport.com/whatis.html. &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the advantages the technology seems to offer, no one
knows for sure that microdisplays will move into the mainstream _
the history of the display industry is littered with technical
innovations that once seemed promising but never worked out.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the biggest question mark, according to Barry
Young, vice president of DisplaySearch, an Austin, Texas,
market-research and consulting company, is not technology but user
reaction. ``Frankly,'' he said, ``holding up a phone or an
organizer to your eye is unnatural in most contexts. It remains to
be seen whether people will get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Some of Silicon Valley's heaviest hitters are apparently
willing to gamble, though, that the technology will find a market.
inViso is partly owned by Three-Five Systems, a Tempe, Ariz.,
company that manufactures screens for Motorola and other cell-phone
manufacturers and has invested in a variety of new display
technologies. But inViso's investor list also includes legendary
venture capitalist Arthur Rock, Intel co-founder and chairman
emeritus Gordon Moore, Intel board member Jim Guzy, Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Partners and several other prominent
venture funds.

BIOLOGISTS, ENGINEERS TEAMING UP TO UNRAVEL GENOMIC THREAD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; The next burst of discovery in the biotech world is being driven
by an alliance between curious biologists and clever engineers, who
are inventing new instruments to probe deeper into the processes of
life.
<P>
   Incyte Pharmaceuticals in Palo Alto is an example of this
convergence between DNA and silicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, biology is a very complex software
system,'' says Randy Scott, Incyte's chief scientist and
co-founder. ``The genes in your DNA encode the information for how
to build a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Incyte is one of several firms racing to find _ and patent _
genes that govern disease or development. This effort, called
genomics, is expected to lead to novel drugs or other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte and its genomics competitors didn't arise in a vacuum.
They relied on instruments built by companies like PE Biosystems in
Foster City and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech in Sunnyvale. These
instruments automatically scan the arrangement of chemicals in each
strand of DNA, and translate this chemical information into a
string of letters called a genetic sequence.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it should come as no surprise that DNA sequencing
instruments evolved here. Once biologists discovered that DNA had
electrical and chemical properties, they looked for ways to handle
and measure the stuff. Who knew more about turning complex
chemistry into practical devices than the scientists and engineers
who mass-produced silicon chips for PCs and lasers for CDs?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this marriage between technical skill and biological
need, new instrument-makers are sprouting up in the South Bay.
Affymetrix of Santa Clara makes chips that automate the process of
identifying genes. Today, they are research tools. One day, they
could be used for routine disease diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Ciphergen in Mountain View is creating chips to automate the
analysis of ``These machines cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars,'' says Ament, 27, raising his voice above the techno-pop
music that blares in the background like a drum beat. ``Every
minute they're down is money lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The data pouring off this sequencing assembly line flows into an
air-conditioned computer center. There, in the quiet chill, an
array of 1,500 PCs takes these raw gene fragments, matches them to
known sequences or marks them as novel, and deposits the data in
storage systems that are the information-equivalent of bank vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built this center a year ago and we're just about out of
room,'' says Will Francis III, the 28-year-old system administrator
who manages the PC array.
</P>
<P>
   The array is another small innovation at the crossroads of
biology and computing. According to Francis, the data massaging
work doesn't require a very powerful computer. There's just so much
data spewing off the sequencing line that Incyte needed a cheaper
way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   So engineers wrote a program, based on the free Linux operating
system, that allows those humble PCs to divvy up the processing
chores. By using free Linux, and buying generic computers, Francis
estimates that Incyte gets the job done at 10 percent of what it
used to cost when the company used powerful workstations running
the Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Saving money should cheer stockholders. But the collaboration
between biology and high tech also expresses itself in sexier ways.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale's Amersham Pharmacia, for instance, is helping
scientists from the University of Delaware analyze microbes taken
from hydrothermal vents 11/2 miles beneath Mexico's Sea of Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   These microbes thrive in some of the harshest conditions on
Earth, says University of Delaware marine biologist Craig Cary.
They live in total darkness, in boiling water, with toxic chemicals
swirling about them and the weight of the ocean bearing down.
</P>
<P>
   These extreme bacteria _ scooped off the bottom by researchers
in a tiny deep-sea sub _ almost certainly contain proteins and
enzymes never before seen on the surface. Cary thinks some of these
chemicals could be used to make drugs or industrial solvents.
</P>
<P>
   But first, this bacterial DNA must be picked apart and examined
_ an ideal task for automated machinery. (See
 &LR; www.ocean.udel.edu/deepsea  &LR; for more on the project.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as our universe enlarged when we looked through the
telescope, and medicine changed when we bent over a microscope,
these new instruments will open new vistas in biology.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest challenges still lie ahead. What researchers are
doing is a gigantic exercise in reverse engineering. They're trying
to pick life apart and see how the little bits of it work.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they isolate more genes and proteins and enzymes,
they're going to want to know how they work together. Predicting
those interactions could make climate change modeling look like
child's play.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Corp. has already started on the process. In December, it
announced a $100 million program that will enlist 50 scientists
from San Jose, Yorktown Heights and six other labs worldwide, in
the development of a radical new computer system, dubbed Blue Gene.
</P>
<P>
   One of the IBM team's first challenges will be writing an
operating system capable of controlling more than 1 million
processors. Only then will they take a crack at the tough stuff,
figuring out how proteins behave.
</P>
<P>
   They'll probably be at it for a while. After all, unraveling
evolution takes time.

 SILICON VALLEY SHAPING NATIONAL POLITICS  &HT;     By JAN BOYD AND STAN BUNGER 
 &HT;         c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
``If you want to know what's going on in America in the 21st
century, you have to know what's happening in Silicon Valley,''
says Democrat Jeff Modisett, most recently Indiana's attorney
general and now vice president of TechNet, Silicon Valley's most
powerful lobbying group.
<P>
   It's no surprise that public officials and political candidates
are buying into that notion, but the numbers may surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over the last two years we've had over 200 elected
officials coming through here _ state, gubernatorial, senatorial,''
says Modisett's counterpart on the Republican side of Tech Net,
Lezlee Westine. ``Last December alone I think we had about a
quarter of the U.S. Senate here in the Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The possible cash connection is the obvious attraction. But so
is information. Finding educated technology advisers inside the
Beltway isn't easy and at this point few elected officials possess
real in-depth technical knowledge. So national technology policy is
unquestionably being shaped by individuals here in the Bay Area;
individuals who have had no connection to the political process
until the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many politicians aren't taking any sort of stand on any
technology issues until they check with TechNet members. The tricky
part is finding an executive to actually meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great interest on behalf of the executives to spend
time with the elected officials, but they are just as busy as any
governor or senator or, frankly, presidential candidate,'' said
Westine, ``so it has been challenging for them to put on their own
calendar the time to meet with all the candidates that come through
here.''
</P>
<P>
   TechNet's primary lobbying issues include normalizing trade
relations with China, public school reform, encouraging accounting
standards that favor high-tech companies, increasing foreign worker
visas, and supporting federal funding for technology and science
research. Listen for evidence of the Silicon Valley influence in
political speeches as the California primary approaches.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL CAPITAL: The approach of the California primary is
also good business for Silicon Valley startup Broad Daylight. The
company makes money by licensing its question-and-answer technology
to Web sites such as Space.com and Gloss.com. But Broad Daylight is
also making its technology available for free to political
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The technology allows candidates to easily answer e-mailed
questions on any issue. The questioner receives a personalized
e-mail response. The candidate can also post the response on his or
her Web site. The answers to the most frequently asked questions
rise to the top of the list of answers on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain uses the technology on his site. The Arizona
Republican presidential candidate has about 200 posted answers.
Broad Daylight CEO Louise Kirkbride says seeing the common sense of
the voters is quite gratifying. ``Many times the questions that get
promoted in the more popular media tend to be more newsworthy
questions, tend to be a little more sensational questions,'' said
Kirkbride. ``What we find, because we track the actual frequency
with which the questions are asked and we see what people really
are interested in. For instance, the single most interesting
question on Senator McCain's site is about the budget surplus. What
would he do with the budget surplus?''
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in finding your own answers to questions
about California ballot propositions, check out Broad Daylight's
own political site:  &LR; www.FAQvoter.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TIDY LITTLE PROFIT: Never overlook the small stuff. Take 2Wire,
a Milpitas startup company that plans to soon begin selling a
product line that will let people with DSL connections easily
create a home network.
</P>
<P>
   2Wire's HomePortal products combine a router, a hub and, in some
cases, a DSL modem. The ``residential gateway'' devices are
expected to sell for $400 and up when they start shipping this
spring. Using a 2Wire HomePortal, a DSL subscriber could spread the
high-speed Internet connection around the house, using existing
internal telephone wiring.
</P>
<P>
   While 2Wire executives hope they'll have a hit product on their
hands, they've already been pleasantly surprised by the success of
a much more mundane offering. That would be a $9.95 filter, used to
isolate ordinary telephone traffic from the higher-frequency DSL
signal traveling over the same set of wires.
</P>
<P>
   The filters are being purchased by DSL providers, which install
them in customers' homes and offices to prevent interference
between voice and data traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke about this (filter) becoming our flagship project,`
said 2Wire CEO Brian Hinman. He calculates the average home has 6
telephone jacks, each of which would need some kind of filter upon
installation of DSL service. And the surge in DSL connections is
something to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hinman, ``My prediction for the year 2000 is that we'll see
about 3 million new lines installed. It's astronomical growth we're
seeing in the DSL market.'' While Hinman didn't provide exact
figures, he said the low-cost filter could easily represent 30 to
40 percent of 2Wire's revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those little filters may turn out to be the tail that wags the
dog.
</P>
<P>
   NON-CEO CEO: It says so right on Ted Ganchiff's business cards:
``Employee Number One.'' Ganchiff is the founder of a San Francisco
company called GiveMeTalk, which bills itself as the home for
do-it-yourself Internet talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary corporate-speak, Ganchiff is the firm's CEO, but he
has a reason for avoiding the term. ``There's something really
strange about calling yourself CEO at a company when it's two
people or three people,'' says Ganchiff. ``I thought `CEO' was
overstating it slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   GiveMeTalk still employs fewer than a dozen people, but has
managed to attract prerecorded audio shows from a wide variety of
people, including KFOG commentator Stan Sinberg and Dr. Moira Gunn,
host of public radio's ``Tech Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also this: a favorable astrological chart. So says
Marlene Caldes, a Mill Valley ``life strategist'' whose reading of
the stars convinces her GiveMeTalk will enjoy a long and successful
run. ``These guys are going to the moon,'' said Caldes. ``The day
they created their company, they had such great astrological
signatures that it would be impossible for them to be temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   Many a startup company wishes it were that easy to figure out.

 MICROSOFT UNVEILS AN AD CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE ITS PORTAL, MSN.COM  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Microsoft Sunday night launched a $150 million ad campaign, its
biggest ever for a consumer product, to promote its portal,
MSN.com.
<P>
   Microsoft hopes the big boost in ad spending _ MSN's last
campaign cost about $18 million _ will help it battle AOL for new
Internet users and brand-name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, MSN.com had more visitors than any other Web
site except for Yahoo, according to Media Metrix. AOL ranked No.3.
But many MSN visitors get there by default because it's the Web
page that pops up when computer users first launch Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser. Microsoft believes MSN lags AOL in
consumer awareness.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason MSN is also changing its logo _ from a
nondescript oval to a butterfly with the same four colors as the
Windows logo. The butterfly signals ``freedom, aspiration and
empowerment,'' as well as a ``rebirth for MSN'' according to
company officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about making the Web indispensable in people's
everyday lives,'' said Deanna Sanford, lead product manager for
MSN.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second MSN spots follow the daily lives of four people of
different ages, backgrounds and Internet experience, as they move
into a house equipped with nothing but a computer with a connection
to MSN.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 or so MSN ads follow different characters, from novices
to experts, as they all become more Web savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say MSN is making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons you go through a rebranding like this is to
step away from the past,'' said Rob Enderle, vice president of
research firm Giga Information Group. ``Microsoft did let MSN
languish _ it was lost in a morass of conflicting strategies _ so
it does makes sense to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   When MSN was launched in the mid-1990s, critics said it came off
as a cold, corporate Web site with limited appeal to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With a relaunch last fall, and a new set of consumer-friendly
tools like instant messaging and community sites, MSN is finally on
track, Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   But he thinks MSN will face stiff competition from the new
AOL-Time Warner juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft probably has more experience doing what they're
trying to do, and AOL is trying to get through a merger,'' he said.
``But AOL isn't being distracted by the (Department of Justice), so
you've got to give them the inside track.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is currently embroiled in an antitrust battle with the
federal government which contends that the Seattle company is a
monopolist that hurt consumers and used its dominance in the
software industry to stifle competition.

 JUST CLICK TO MAKE A PASSAGE TO INDIA  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Every morning, Jayashree Sambamurthy pulls up RadioOfIndia.com on
her computer and listens to classical Carnatic music from her
homeland.
<P>
   Later, she'll tune in TVofIndia.com to watch a Hindi language
television show, or switch to PressOfIndia.com to read the online
version of a regional Indian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really great,'' said Sambamurthy, whose apartment in
Clovis near Fresno seems light years away from her native land.
``We are so far away from our homeland and we get it right on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The three sister sites were launched in the past month by
Homeland Networks Inc., a San Jose startup that believes the Web is
a prime vehicle for reaching the estimated 150,000 India natives
living and working in the Bay Area and an estimated 15 million
nonresident Indians worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indian community is one of the most computer-savvy and
connected immigrant communities in the world,'' said Homeland chief
executive Ron Victor.
</P>
<P>
   Homeland was co-founded in September by Sabeer Bhatia, who is
best known as the founder of Hotmail, the free e-mail service that
he sold to Microsoft in 1998 for a tidy $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   And one of Homeland's minority investors is the Indian media
company Unilazer Group, whose UTV unit is a television programming
company that is providing live and taped content for the site. UTV
invested about $1 million in Homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The TVofIndia site launched February 4 and offers TV shows like
``Amar Chitra Katha,'' a series depicting historical events in
India. Victor said another popular show is ``Meerabai,'' a series
about one of India's key religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular are game shows like ``Kricket,'' which is a cross
between a cricket match and a trivia show like ``Jeopardy.'' The
site was also able to Webcast the live India-Pakistan cricket
series earlier this month. That game is hugely popular in India but
not found on American sports channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find it here, that's why they crave it,'' said
Victor, who also missed watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   Indian television is not new to the Internet. MSNBC.com, for
example, has a live 24-hour feed from India's NDTV network.
</P>
<P>
   But Victor said he hopes his site appeals to people who don't
want to buy a satellite dish to get more news and entertainment
from India or are not satisfied with the limited number of Indian
shows on broadcast stations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The shows appear in RealVideo streaming video at preset times;
there is one show playing at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Victor admits the Web telecasts are best viewed by computer
users with high-speed Internet connections, not people with slower
56K connections. However, he's counting on the near future when
broadband connections become more prevalent in homes.
</P>
<P>
   The TVofIndia site also links to RadioOfIndia, which launched
January 4 and has about 600 regular daily listeners. The radio site
offers news, cricket matches and the soundtracks of the latest hits
from Bollywood, India's equivalent to Hollywood.

COMPROMISE ON CONFEDERATE FLAG GAINS SUPPORT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Gov. Jim Hodges won the support of several
ranking black state legislators on Monday for his proposal to
remove the Confederate battle flag from atop the state Capitol and
raise a smaller version of the flag near a monument on the side of
the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP, which is boycotting the state until the flag is
removed, still opposes the plan. But a growing number of
legislators, black and white, now consider the plan a reasonable
compromise, raising the possibility that the NAACP may be isolated
by black leaders who want the issue put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate what the NAACP has done to bring this to the
forefront,'' said Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a Democrat who is the
state House minority leader. ``But I think many of us in the
Legislative Black Caucus now recognize that this proposal has the
possibility of bringing all sides together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges proposed putting a square version of the flag, which is
considered more accurate by many Civil War historians, near a
statue of Confederate Gen. Wade Hampton, who served as a senator
and as governor of the state. The site is not as prominent as
either the dome or the Confederate Soldiers' Monument in front of
the Capitol where many flag supporters have said the flag should
fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep our state's business climate strong, including
our important tourism industry,'' Hodges said. ``And we want to
send a signal to the nation, and to our children, that South
Carolinians can come together to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature controls the flag's fate, and several staunch
flag supporters in the Republican majority of the House oppose the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker David H. Wilkins, a leader of the pro-flag
forces, praised the governor for putting the plan forward. Wilkins
said he prefers putting the flag near the Confederate Soldiers'
Monument, but a statement he issued seemed to leave open the
possibility of compromise.

 &HT;    Stability of mobiles questioned
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Experts say there's no truth to the rumor that mobile
homes act as tornado magnets. But even the newer, improved variety
are less likely than traditional houses to protect their occupants
in bad weather, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of mobile homes were literally blown apart by a series of
violent tornadoes that swept through south Georgia counties, Grady,
Mitchell, Colquitt and Tift, shortly after midnight Monday, leaving
a war-zone's worth of death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers, still searching the rubble late Monday, could
not say how many died in mobile homes. But officials said at least
some of the victims did.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of mobile homes were in the area the tornado hit,'' said
Sheriff's Lt. Cecil Wingate of Mitchell County. ``I'm almost sure
all of those killed here were in mobile homes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, 45 percent of all tornado deaths
nationwide have been in mobile homes, yet only 7 percent of the
population occupy them, said Thomas W. Schmidlin, a meteorologist
and geography professor at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio.
Schmidlin and his colleagues have spent years studying risk factors
for death due to tornadoes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1998, 200 deaths were recorded nationwide in
mobile homes during tornadoes. Georgia had 35 such fatalities,
second highest in the nation, Schmidlin said. Florida led with 49
mobile home-tornado deaths, some of which were in parked
recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, mobile homes in Georgia are required by law to be
anchored to the ground; the manufacturer usually recommends the
type of tie-downs to be used.
</P>
<P>
   But here, as in other states including Florida, tie-down
enforcement and inspection is spotty, said Gina Gassert,
spokeswoman for state Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, whose
office regulates mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many states like Georgia rely on local code officials to
handle inspections,'' she said. ``It's up to the local building
code officials to inspect and make sure mobile homes are tied down.
But I'm sure there are some out there that aren't tied down and
aren't inspected.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine has a staff of six inspectors who check mobile home
installations only when their owners file complaints, Gassert said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million of Georgia's 7.8 million residents live in
mobile homes, and 60 percent of the mobile homes are on private
land, rather than in trailer parks, according to the Atlanta-based
Georgia Manufactured Housing Association. Although mobile homes
aren't cheap _ averaging $42,000 in Georgia, excluding land costs _
they still offer more affordable housing than site built homes.
</P>
<P>
   The average mobile home owner in Georgia is 33 years old, with
an annual income of $30,000, GMHA figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile home manufacturing is big business in Georgia. With 27
manufacturing plants employing more than 6,000 people, Georgia
leads the nation in the production of mobile homes, according to
GMHA.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the federal department of Housing and Urban
Development, which regulates mobile home building, has been slowly
enacting more stringent construction standards, especially in
hurricane-prone coastal areas where mobile homes must be able to
withstand winds of 110 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies have shown today's manufactured home, if properly
installed, will perform well from a safety standpoint,'' said
Charlotte Gattis, GMHA president.
</P>
<P>
   But they are still not as safe as site-built homes, said Peter
Sparks, a Clemson University professor who studies wind resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile homes are not very heavy and they take off rather
easily,'' he said. ``People are always much more vulnerable in
mobile homes than in regular houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk of injury or death is so great that the National
Weather Service advises mobile home residents to take shelter in a
ditch or vehicle if a tornado threatens. Most tornado-related
mobile home deaths are caused by blunt force trauma from flying
debris, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidlin is conducting studies that suggest vehicles, with
safety glass and seat belts, may indeed be safer than mobile homes
in high winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally we're finding that cars and pickup trucks can
withstand winds of 118 miles an hour and above, which would
certainly destroy most mobile homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned, however, that sturdy structures with windowless rooms
provide the best shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' he said, ``is that people in mobile homes
just ought to have someplace else they can go in a storm.''

   &UR; NORVILLE DOES TIME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deborah Norville &LR; , distinguished member of the ``Inside
Edition'' team, entered a jail in North Carolina over the weekend
to spend five days there and report on the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to portray what life behind bars is really like
is to spend a considerable amount of time behind bars,'' announced
Norville last week. ``One day wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was nervous about the assignment. ``I'm probably
going in with the same trepidation that any lady in there probably
feels.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - With Austrian politics in mind, Rep. &UR; Connie Morella &LR; , R-Md.,
announced she would boycott the National Chamber Orchestra's
``Night in Old Vienna,'' upon which music director  &UR; Piotr Gajewski &LR; 
canceled the event. Morella, co-chair of the event, told the
Washington Post that she was sorry for the orchestra and would
``definitely help with subsequent fund-raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   - Movie critic  &UR; Jan Wahl  &LR; ran into  &UR; Bill Bradley &LR;  at KRON last
week and asked him about his favorite movies. His immediate first
choice: ``State of the Union,'' the  &UR; Frank Capra  &LR; movie that
starred  &UR; Spencer Tracy &LR;  and  &UR; Katharine Hepburn &LR; . The plot concerns
a Republican candidate who learns to speak out more strongly as his
campaign progresses.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Robin Givens &LR; , who used to be married to  &UR; Mike Tyson &LR; , is the
new host of the talk show ``Forgive or Forget'' (KBHK, Channel 44,
noon). cq  &LR; Givens told Vibe magazine she asked her family for
forgiveness after she ignored her mother's pleas that she not
become an actress and not marry Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Reading herein last week about  &UR; John Dean  &LR; saying at a recent
Watergate conference that his naming  &UR; Al Haig &LR;  as Deep Throat was
the first time he'd ever said it in public, &UR; Gary Berger  &LR; forwards a
few pages from Dean's 1982 book, ``Lost Honor.'' The apparently
forgetful author went on for many pages about his conclusion that
Haig had been the whistle-blowing Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Tony Reveaux &LR; , who received a check for 1 cent from a
subsidiary of Pacific Bell, realized that endorsed over to the
right recipient, ``it can exact more than a penny's worth of
justice.'' He's sending it to the  &UR; Linda Tripp &LR;  Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Twist magazine says  &UR; Ricky Martin  &LR; spends $1,000 a month on
``facial products.''
</P>
<P>
   - At a preview party in New York last week for ``The Beach,''
Siberian-born supermodel  &UR; Irina Pantaeva &LR;  told  &UR; Baird Jones  &LR; that
 &UR; Jay McInerney  &LR; has been working on a screenplay about her life. She
said she would like  &UR; Natalie Portman &LR;  to play her as a young
person, ``and then to play me in my 40s, I think  &UR; Catherine &LR; 
 &UR; Zeta-Jones &LR;  would be perfect.'' Zeta-Jones is 30.
</P>
<P>
   Horse race commentator  &UR; Trevor Denman &LR; , who had never watched
``The Simpsons'' but was featured on a recent episode of the show,
told the Daily Racing Form about his trepidations about the gig.
``I suppose the main thing I was terrified about,'' he said, in a
clip forwarded by &UR; Patrick Walsh &LR; , ``was the caricature of me. I was
sure I was going to have orange hair, sticking straight up. As it
was, I looked almost normal, at least compared to the lady with the
blue hair.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody can argue that the number of unwanted pregnancies is
connected to the way we dress. When people are more casual about
their dress, they're more casual about whether they have protected
sex and more casual about the use of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; George Zimmer  &LR; of the Men's Wearhouse in the menswear daily
DNR. Zimmer was speaking in favor of Dress-Up Thursday, the
menswear industry's counterattack to Dress-Down Friday.

OFFICER, TESTIFYING IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, SAYS HE THOUGHT DIALLO HAD
GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: The 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET)

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ His head low and his voice halting, Officer Sean
Carroll broke a year of public silence on Monday to describe how he
led his three partners into the shooting of Amadou Diallo, who was
struck by 19 of 41 police bullets fired at him as he stood,
unarmed, in the lobby of his apartment building in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   With Diallo's parents and Carroll's own family in the front row
of the courtroom, he choked out his testimony as he described his
realization of his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo ``was still moving on the floor,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Don't die. Don't die. Keep breathing,''' he said, but Diallo
stopped breathing. ``I was holding his hands, telling him to keep
breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to resuscitate Diallo, Carroll then lifted his
shirt, he said. But seeing two bullet wounds in his abdomen, he
decided he might do more harm than good. ``I said, `Oh, my God.' I
just held his hand and rubbed his face and said, `Please don't
die.'''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Carroll, who had never before spoken publicly
about what happened that night, is the centerpiece of the defense
in the trial of the four white New York City police officers
charged with the murder of Diallo, a West African immigrant, on
Feb. 4 last year. The defense lawyers hope to humanize the officers
by putting them on the witness stand to explain what happened, in
their own words, and make the jury see the incident from their
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The defense needs to persuade the jury that the shooting was
justified. Both Carroll and Officer Edward McMellon, who testified
later in the day, said they thought Diallo had a gun, and that they
feared for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, four blacks and eight whites, watched Carroll
intently, but showed no reaction as he testified. Diallo's mother,
Kadiatou, hung her head and wept as Carroll described the final
minutes of her son's life. Diallo, he said, never uttered a word
throughout the entire incident, even as he lay dying.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four defendants, Carroll looks, perhaps, the least like
the stereotypical police officer. His hair is a bit longer than the
extra-short cuts of the three other defendants and his rimless
glasses give him the bookish appearance of a high school English
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Flushing section of Queens, Carroll is the oldest of
six children. He has been married for 13 years and has an
11-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son. He attended college for
several years and spent five years as a restaurant manager before
entering the New York Police Academy in 1993. He had wanted a
military career, he said, because ``I was always brought up to help
people.'' But his family obligations made that impractical, he
said, so he joined the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll first lost his composure on Monday when his lawyer, John
D. Patten, asked, bluntly, ``Who is Kevin Gillespie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Gillespie was a friend of mine,'' he replied after a
long pause. ``He was shot and killed on the Grand Concourse
approximately three years ago.'' It was decided, he said, that
``because he was such a great person and even a better cop, his
locker would be left as a shrine in his memory.'' That locker was
near his at the headquarters of the Street Crimes Unit on Randalls
Island, and he saw it every day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has asserted that incidents like the Gillespie
killing and other experiences the officers have had played a role
in their state of mind on the night of the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had been in the department's Street Crimes Unit for
about two years when the Diallo shooting happened. He had fired his
gun only once before, he said, in August 1997, when someone was
shooting at him and another officer from the roof of an apartment
building. The shooter was not caught.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo caught his attention, Carroll said, because he kept
looking up and down the street from the stoop of his building, then
retreating. He and the three other officers, in an unmarked car and
plain clothes, stopped and got out of the car, with Carroll leading
the way. Diallo, he said, fit the general description of a serial
rapist they had been looking for who followed women into buildings.

&HT;        GOP LAWMAKER TO TAKE AIM AT BIG DIG
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 -- A powerful House Republican is
considering ways to strip next year's funding for the Central
Artery project, and may advocate a criminal investigation into
whether Big Dig officials lied to federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a federal audit of the Big Dig that suggests the project
could cost more than $12.2 billion, Rep. Frank R. Wolf, chair of
the House appropriations committee, could demand that funds already
authorized for the Big Dig be denied, a congressional GOP aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has already authorized Big Dig funding through
its scheduled completion in 2005, Wolf may ask the Federal Highway
authorities to put an immediate freeze on contracting work on the
Big Dig, the aide said. The federal highway administration does not
need congressional approval to do this.
</P>
<P>
   He is to address the subject at a House hearing on
transportation spending Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The aide said Wolf, a longstanding critic of the Big Dig, is
furious at both Big Dig managers and the Federal Highway
Administration that oversees the project for failing to disclose
cost overruns and possibly trying to hide the true costs.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig officials made the surprising announcement early this
month that the project would be $1.4 billion over budget.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is also reviewing whether Big Dig officials' failure to
report the shortfalls to the Department of Transportation inspector
general warrants civil or criminal penalties. The inspector general
Kenneth Mead was unaware of the $1.4 billion figure, but released a
report Monday arguing the overruns could be even greater.
</P>
<P>
   If the law was violated, Wolf may ask the Justice Department to
get involved, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   And since Congress must approve funding levels authorized for
the Big Dig every year through 2005, Wolf could offer an amendment
that kills next year's funding for the Big Dig project.
Massachusetts would be able to keep the money for other road and
highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Olver, D-Amherst, who also sits on the subcommittee,
said he was skeptical the Big Dig could be killed in the
appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen,'' Olver said. ``That's irrational.
I can't imagine that kind of thing coming out of subcommittee.''
But he added of tomorrow's hearing: ``It could produce some
considerable fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout all of this, the crux of this is that the Big Dig's
got to be finished,'' Olver said. ``We've got to get it done.''

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ The two men in charge of this divided
town, a U.N. administrator and a French general, said Monday that
they were counting on two foreign judges to punish extremists after
12 days of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the violence stops, Mario Morcone, the U.N. administrator
in Mitrovica, and Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, the French
commander of peacekeeping troops in northern Kosovo, said they fear
that ethnic relations will be poisoned permanently.
</P>
<P>
   De Saqui de Sannes, who has blamed the violence on both sides,
said individuals were instigating attacks purposely to escalate the
violence and to destroy the last multiethnic town in Kosovo where
Serbs and Albanians are still living side by side, if uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extremists who want the peace to fail,'' he said in
an interview at his headquarters. While the violence consists of
``isolated acts,'' he said, the strategy is to escalate tensions
and intolerance. ``I am worried that we may be in the process of an
escalation of intolerance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanians have wanted to push the Serbs in northern
Mitrovica and beyond out of Kosovo, and some Serbs have wanted to
do the opposite _ push the Albanians remaining among them south of
the Ibar river, which divides Mitrovica, in order to create a pure
Serbian area in northern Kosovo, he said. ``The people are hostages
to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morcone said that it was now clear who the troublemakers were
and that it was critical to move against them. A judge and a
prosecutor, both foreigners, were arriving to start dealing with
the dozens of people arrested during Sunday's violence. ``You may
well see more arrests in the following days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to arrest people and remove them from the scene. We
know the people who are involved,'' he said. ``For me it has to be
the solution, not only for me here, but for all of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   French troops rounded up and arrested 46 people _ 45 Albanians
and one Serb _ on Sunday after a day of furious firefights between
NATO-led peacekeepers and local gunmen. A dozen were quickly
released, de Saqui de Sannes said, and the rest were being
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that some Serbs would also be arrested, Marcone said,
``Yesterday was a bad day for the Albanians, but that will not be
all.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, Albanians engaged the French in heavy
firefights, and in the resulting melee two French soldiers were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   According to the general, a crowd of Albanians gathered Sunday
morning near a French guard post after a grenade exploded and
wounded five Albanians. The crowd began throwing stones at French
soldiers who then cordoned off the area. Then a man appeared from a
house, shouted at the people to get down, and fired directly at the
soldiers, hitting one in the stomach and a second as he moved to
react, the general said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers pursued the man but did not catch him. There ensued
several hours of shooting as French soldiers moved into the
district and came under fire from several directions. Eventually
they surrounded some 18 people in a house and got them to
surrender. They found only one weapon in the house, but since then
have seized more weapons during house searches, the general said.
</P>
<P>
   There were women and minors among those arrested, he added. One
old woman was found to be concealing a Kalashnikov rifle under her
skirt, he said. Soldiers also stopped a local ambulance driving
towards Mitrovica on Monday and discovered 180 grenades and
anti-tank rockets inside, the general recounted.
</P>
<P>
   During the fighting Sunday a group of some 30 armed Albanians
also tried to ford the Ibar river to the west of the city, but were
spotted and deterred with warning shots, a spokesman for the French
force said.
</P>
<P>
   The events are likely to aggravate relations between the French
troops and the ethnic Albanians here. Thousands flocked on Monday
to the burial of the one man killed by French troops during the
fighting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Avni Haradinaj, 35, a former guerrilla fighter of the Kosovo
Liberation Army and a local hero, was buried with full honors by
his former comrades in arms. His coffin, draped in the red Albanian
flag, was carried up the hill to the edge of a wood outside the
city, through a crowd of some 3,000 mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian mayor of Mitrovica, Bajram Rexhepi, who said he had
been a friend of the dead man, said Haradinaj was unarmed when he
was shot by French soldiers and was in Mitrovica visiting his
sisters. ``There were four people with him and they explained that
he had no weapon at the moment he was killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Saqui de Sannes insisted that Haradinaj was armed and was
shooting at the French soldiers when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   The general tried to reassure the Albanians of French
neutrality. ``If we were shot at by Albanians, it is difficult to
arrest Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the few weeks since he took command, peacekeeping troops have
raided a Serb bar that has frequently been identified as a hangout
of troublemakers, even of paramilitaries. They also arrested a man
close to the Serb leader of north Mitrovica for possessing a
telescopic sight, and expelled him from the city for 20 days under
a special resolution introduced by the United Nations last year,
the general said.
</P>
<P>
   The general defended his troops' actions on the night of Feb. 3,
when Serb mobs rampaged through the city and left eight Albanians
dead. The peacekeepers worked hard to contain the violence, he
said, blockading the city to prevent outsiders from adding to the
violence, and evacuating Albanians and foreigners to safety. ``If
the troops had not acted as they did, it would have been a lot
worse, a real massacre,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The need now is for a political solution, for institutions and
money, to lift the economy and deny extremists an open field, the
general said. ``I cannot do much more,'' he warned. ``I cannot stop
someone throwing a grenade.''

DEFENSE TESTS RUSHED, PENTAGON OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is facing undue pressure to meet an
``artificial'' deadline for recommending whether to deploy the
national missile defense system, according to the project's senior
weapons tester, who said the current timetable disregards enormous
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual report, released on Monday, Philip E. Coyle III,
the Pentagon's director of operational testing and evaluation, said
that the speed with which the Pentagon must judge the feasibility
of the multi-billion-dollar system to protect the country from
limited nuclear strikes is being driven more by President Clinton's
summer deadline than by scientific requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Coyle said the Pentagon was facing undue pressure
``to meet an artificial decision point in the development
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This pattern has historically resulted in a negative effect on
virtually every troubled D.O.D. development program,'' he added,
using initials for the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first warning from a senior Pentagon official that
the test schedule prevents the military from reliably telling
Clinton by the June deadline whether the system is ready to deploy.
Coyle did not comment on the report on Monday, but said through a
spokesperson that his report stands on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The report also comes as European allies, as well as a handful
of members of Congress, are asking Clinton to delay his decision so
it can be made next year by a newly elected president and Congress.
But missile defense proponents in Congress, especially Republicans,
are urging a speedy deployment of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be one of the most serious decisions a president of
the United States may make in modern times, and if the technology
piece isn't there to look at all of the options, then we have to
defer the decision,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is urging
a delay even though he is a strong supporter of missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has twice tested components of a system to knock
down a missile in space. Monday's report confirmed that although
the first test last October was initially hailed as a success, it
is uncertain whether the interceptor could actually have hit the
mock warhead without having mistakenly steered toward the target by
locking in error on a decoy balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious setback came last month, when the missile
test-fired from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific failed to hit
the warhead launched from a California air base. Investigators said
the problem might have been a leak in a pipe that cools infrared
sensors, blinding the interceptor in the last six seconds of the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   If that test had succeeded, the Pentagon would have met its own
minimum standard for advising the president that the technology was
feasible for deploying the system in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the failure pushed to the middle of May the third and
final test to show that the system works before the June review.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next test coming up doesn't give you a lot of time to
collect the data and present it for the review,'' said Lt. Col.
Richard Lehner of the Air Force, the spokesman for the Pentagon's
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. ``Each test requires a
30-day review, a 60-day review and a 90-day review to understand
the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials have warned that the military was on a
``rigorous schedule'' that allowed for few failures in creating the
system to protect all 50 states from a a limited ballistic missile
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last
week, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said the project was
``on track'' and that he would be able to make his recommendation
to Clinton in June.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle's strong warning in the report on Monday questions that
assumption. While not openly asking for a delay, Coyle said the
administration must ``allow time'' to examine the results from the
third test.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and some supporters of the system have complained that
the deadline was dictated by election-year politics rather than
science. They argue that Clinton wants to decide whether to deploy
the system this summer in order to prevent the Republicans from
accusing the Democrats of being soft on defense in the general
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In order to deploy the system, the administration is asking
Russia to agree to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
which forbids a national missile defense system. But the Russians
have refused to make any changes, saying the treaty is the
cornerstone to all non-proliferation agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is leading negotiations
with Russia and discussions with the European allies, who have
raised questions about the system. In a visit to Washington last
week, Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said that as the
administration pursued a national missile defense it was ``very
important that we preserve the unity of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott is leading a delegation to Beijing this week to discuss,
among other issues, Chinese anger that the United States could
deploy such a system.
</P>
<P>
   China fears that the United States would use its missile defense
to protect Taiwan, which Beijing considers a Chinese province.

REPUBLICANS SEEK TO END A SOCIAL SECURITY PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in the House introduced legislation
Monday that would allow most Social Security recipients to earn as
much money as they want without giving up any of their retirement
benefit. President Clinton said he would sign the bill if it passed
Congress and came to him without being linked to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is intended to deal with a longstanding policy
that critics said discouraged older people from continuing to work
after they reached normal retirement age and began drawing Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Social Security recipients aged 65 through 69
lose $1 of their benefit for every $3 they earn beyond a maximum
amount that is recalculated each year. This year the maximum is
$17,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are no losses of benefits for those 70 or older. For
recipients aged 62 to 65, benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2
earned beyond a limit, which this year is $10,080.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, introduced Monday by Reps. Clay Shaw of Florida and
Sam Johnson of Texas, both Republicans, would repeal the earnings
limits for recipients from 65 through 69, allowing them to make as
much money as they want without any loss of benefit.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 Social Security recipients aged 65 through 69 gave
up part of their benefit last year because of their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of their reasons for working,'' Shaw said, ``they
are losing Social Security benefits that they earned, because they
chose to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not change the earnings limits on beneficiaries
under the age of 65. About 400,000 people in that age group lost
part of their benefit. Because of the complicated way that Social
Security benefits are calculated, members of both parties said that
ending the earnings limit on early retirees could wind up reducing
benefits for some people over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday with CNN, Clinton said he was
``thrilled'' by the prospect of scaling back the earnings limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 65 today in America, your life expectancy is 83,''
Clinton said. ``You want to be alert, you want to be physically
strong. And we know as people stay more active, they're going to
live better, not just longer. So I don't think we should penalize
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan cooperation on the bill, Clinton said, could be a
sign that Republicans are willing to work with him on the broader
problem of assuring Social Security's long-term solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Scaling back the earnings limit would result in Social
Security's paying out $22.7 billion in additional benefits over the
next decade, to be paid out of the payroll taxes that finance the
system.
</P>
<P>
   But the system's actuaries told Congress Monday that the change
would not affect Social Security's long-term solvency. That is in
part because the additional payments over the short run would be
offset over the longer run by a related technical change in the way
that older retirees are currently credited with a slightly higher
benefit for taking a reduced benefit in the early years of
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides and White House officials said the change
would also not reduce the projected federal budget surplus outside
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they intended to move the bill out of the Ways
and Means Committee in the next few weeks and bring it up for a
vote on the House floor soon after.

   A NASA spacecraft on Valentine's Day maneuvered into orbit
around a distant asteroid named for the Greek god of love.
</P>
<P>
   The $224.1 million Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, or NEAR,
spacecraft reached 433 Eros on Monday _ kicking off a yearlong,
closeup study of a rocky celestial fragment likely left over from
the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rendezvous, which began the first orbit ever of an asteroid,
thrilled scientists at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied
Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., who are conducting the mission
for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be Valentine's Day for most people, but it's
Christmas Eve for me, with all the presents piled up and waiting to
be opened,'' said Andrew Cheng, the NEAR mission's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of Eros transmitted by the probe Monday revealed a gray
realm ravaged by impacts with meteorites. Among the many craters
scientists identified was a large heart-shaped depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The asteroids include many different kinds of objects,'' Cheng
said. ``Some of them are the building blocks that the terrestrial
planets were made out of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are the fragments you get when objects the size
of planets get blown apart (by collisions with other planets),'' he
said. ``In either case, we are looking back at a time that is very
close to the beginning of the solar system, something like 4.5
billion years ago.''
</P>
<P>

and rubble. As time passed, the smaller material joined into larger
objects that grew more massive, broke apart and rejoined through

   Eros is peanut-shaped, or as one scientist characterized it,

   The asteroid circles the sun 160 million miles from Earth.

   NEAR's 57-second maneuver Monday placed it into an initial

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. has put its chief financial
officer, E. Stanley O'Neal, in charge of the nation's biggest
brokerage operation and on track to be the next chairman of the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, one of the highest-ranking blacks on Wall Street, is the
first person to be named to oversee Merrill's 14,200 brokers
without having been a stockbroker himself. He succeeds John L.
Steffens, a former broker who has been president of the brokerage
unit for 15 years. Steffens, one of Merrill's top three executives,
was named chairman of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill chose Thomas Patrick, 56, an executive vice president
who once was the firm's chief financial officer, to replace O'Neal
in that job.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and people inside Merrill interpreted O'Neal's job
switch as a sign that he has the early lead in the race to succeed
David H. Komansky as chairman and chief executive in a few years.
The firm's presidency, the slot directly below Komansky's, has been
vacant since Herbert M. Allison abruptly left the firm in July.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky, who is 60, said Monday that he intends to continue
working until he is 65. ``We certainly have no plans to name a
president for at least two years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That will leave time for O'Neal to prove his ability to run one
of Merrill's core businesses while it is going through a period of
sweeping change. The firm, which started out as a stock brokerage
firm and evolved over the years into a diversified provider of
financial services, derives about half of its profit from its
brokerage operations.
</P>
<P>
   In that post, people inside the firm say, O'Neal will be
competing with the heads of two of the firm's other business units:
Thomas W. Davis, who runs the institutional business, and Jeffrey
M. Peek, who is trying to turn around Merrill's mutual-fund unit.
One of the three is likely to be the next president, those people
say.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Komansky declined to handicap the competition.
``My very, very, very strong preference is to name an insider'' to
succeed Allison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said he had been studying the brokerage operation for a
couple of years, but added that ``there are a lot of people in this
business I need to meet.'' With Merrill's introduction of online
trading last year, he said, ``we've got the right formula and we
have all the right attributes to compete for garnering assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they thought the job was now O'Neal's to
win or lose. ``I've got to believe he's the front-runner now,''
said Steve Galbraith, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
``He's the one guy who will have had experience in all areas of the
firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming chief financial officer in 1998, O'Neal, 48, was
an investment banker. He joined the firm in 1986 from General
Motors, where he started out working the night shift in an assembly
plant in Doraville, Ga. After graduating from the General Motors
Institute, now known as Kettering University, O'Neal won a
scholarship from the automaker to attend Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving his master's degree from Harvard, he joined the
treasury department of General Motors in New York and worked there
until he left for Merrill. In 14 years at Merrill, O'Neal has run
its junk-bond business and has been co-head of its institutional
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky said that O'Neal has the qualities necessary to make
the transition from one side of the firm to the other, which he
described as ``a lot of common sense and a willingness to learn.''
But some people close to the firm questioned whether O'Neal's
buttoned-down demeanor would suit him well as he tries to rally the
firm's brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment comes as Merrill is shifting away from charging
customers commissions on all transactions toward collecting annual
fees based on how much money customers invest with the firm.
Merrill also has embraced low-commission online trading after a
bruising internal battle over whether the firm should compete
head-on with the leading online brokerage, Charles Schwab Corp.,
and a raft of low-priced competition.
</P>
<P>
   That dissension played a role in the departure of Allison, who
was in line to be the first chairman of Merrill who had not been a
broker. Komansky is the latest in a long line of Merrill leaders
who started out selling stocks and bonds to individual customers,
and he eventually informed Allison that Allison would never succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Allison, a onetime investment banker, who identified
O'Neal as a potential leader several years ago. But, unlike
Allison, who thrived as the firm's chief financial officer, O'Neal
``never wanted it in the first place,'' said a person who knows him
well. Worse, he held the job at a difficult time in 1998, when
Merrill's bond business suffered huge losses in the aftermath of
Russia's default on its national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky hinted at that sentiment when he goaded O'Neal to
answer a question about how he liked the finance job, a position
that is not held in high regard on Wall Street because its holder
cannot produce any revenue or profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be honest,'' Komansky said. ``Tell him how much you liked
being CFO.''
</P>
<P>
   But, true to his character, O'Neal declined to reveal his
feelings. People who know O'Neal often describe him as a
``conservative'' man who hold his cards ``very close to the vest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not fit the persona'' of past Merrill leaders,
likeKomansky and his predecessor, Daniel Tully, said a person who
has worked closely with O'Neal. ``He's going to have to glad-hand
and make nice-nice with clients. That's going to be a challenge for
Stan.''

   Within a few weeks, scientists plan to gradually reduce the
separation. They are discussing the possibility near the end of the
mission of attempting a gentle landing, a kind of planetary
touch-and-go that would disclose whether Eros has a dusty or solid
surface.
</P>
<P>
   On a grander scale scientists expect to reveal whether Eros is
actually one large rock or a collection of smaller fragments
corralled together by gravity. Those findings could help humans
defend themselves against a future collision with an asteroid, like
the devastating impact of more than 60 million years ago that
struck Earth with such energy it blinded the sun long enough to
wipe out the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understandably, the physical characteristics are really
essential to know if we are ever called upon as a society to defend
against an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth,'' said
Carl Pilcher, NASA's chief of solar system studies. ``If you hope
to deflect an asteroid on a collision course, you'd sure like to
know how that asteroid will respond to whatever force you put on
it, either with an explosion or a (gentler) impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a Delta expendable rocket
Feb. 17, 1996, NEAR wound its way nearly 1.9 billion miles through
the solar system to keep its appointment with Eros.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, it was to reach its destination in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   However, after a Dec. 20, 1998, engine misfire during a steering
maneuver, NEAR spun out of control and nearly exhausted its
electrical power. With only minutes of power to spare, control
teams at Johns Hopkins regained authority over the spacecraft and
plotted the celestial U-turn that set up Monday's rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk about the difficulty of space. It isn't easy,'' NASA
administrator Dan Goldin said after Monday's success.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the agency's helm in 1992, Goldin urged the
development of a smaller and less expensive class of robotic
planetary probes. His policies came under criticism as being too
frugal in the wake of last year's losses of the Mars Polar Lander
and the Mars Climate Orbiter. Both Mars craft lost communications
with Earth as they maneuvered toward their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not how you deal with success,'' Goldin said. ``It's how
you deal with failure, or the potential for failure, and come
back.''

 &HT;    Healtheon/WebMD buying key rival for dominance on Net
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Healtheon/WebMD Corp. on Monday took a
multibillion-dollar step toward its goal of health care dominance
on the Internet by announcing the purchase of Medical Manager
Corp., one of its main rivals for that burgeoning business.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, valued at about $5 billion worth of Healtheon/WebMD
stock, also includes CareInsite, which is 69 percent owned by New
Jersey-based Medical Manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger of these three companies represents a critical step
in the realization of our collective vision to transform the health
care industry by using the Internet to enable a more efficient and
effective health care delivery system,'' said Jeff Arnold, chief
executive of Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Manager has several units, but its key business is
selling software to help run doctors' offices. The company has
connections to about 455,000 physicians. CareInsite aims to link
doctors, insurers and patients who need to exchange confidential
information. Healtheon/WebMD means to use the Net to offer
professionals and companies a cheaper way to transact business,
while giving consumers a source of medical data.
</P>
<P>
   That is an ambitious goal. Health care now accounts for an
estimated 14 percent of the nation's $7 trillion-a-year economy.
With most experts agreeing that much of the paperwork in health
care is costly and wasteful, Healtheon/WebMD aims to become the
pivot point for the expected surge of transactions to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``WebMD's strategy has not been to take a giant step, but
instead has been this continuous juggernaut of deals,'' said Eric
Brown, research director for health care e-commerce at Forrester
Research. ``They are not done.'' If there remains a major gap, it
is the inability thus far of Healtheon/WebMD _ or anyone else _ to
lure doctors into regular use of computer technology, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet to most consumers is a vehicle for self-service.
However, physicians mostly don't see the need for jumping onto the
Net at work, since they are not the source of the inefficiency that
Net use might resolve, Brown said. ``Yes, the system is
inefficient, but it's efficient for the doctors. A really great
story still has to be told to the docs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is already the sum of a series of mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, founded in Atlanta by Arnold as a company sending medical
data via fax, merged in November with Healtheon, founded by
entrepreneur Jim Clark. The combination included Atlanta-based
Greenberg Networks and Mede America.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Healtheon/WebMD has been a maker of
deals. The company has picked up some deep-pocketed partners _
among them DuPont, Microsoft and News Corp. _ providing capital
that can be used to emblazon the company's name on everything from
hockey arena walls to television commercials to CNN spots. To
extend the reach of its business, the company has forged deals with
Eli Lilly, Medibuy.com and drugstore chain CVS, among others.
</P>
<P>
   With name recognition, the company can increasingly lure
customers. And as it gathers still more capital, Healtheon/WebMD
can fill in gaps in its business or technology by making an
investment, as it did last week with Atlanta-based InfoCure, or an
outright purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the Medical Manager announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is compelling. Although CareInsite and Healtheon/WebMD
are not yet making a profit, they represent two of the most visible
providers of Internet health care service. Hundreds of others are
out there _ including Healthgate, Medscape and DrKoop.com _ but
none has the sheer marketing muscle of Healtheon/WebMD. Adding to
that power is the use of company stock as currency to make deals.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD stock has not returned to its stratospheric
heights of last May when it crested at $105 a share, or even its
more recent surge to $70. However, at Monday's closing price of
$56.62 1/2 per share, the company is still worth about $8.5 billion
_ more than enough to buy Medical Manager, which has more than
twice the revenue of Healtheon. And in the wake of the Monday's
announcement, several analysts upgraded the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the power of the deal could work against it.
</P>
<P>
   That is, federal regulators may view the merger as creating not
just a pre-eminent company, but a rival against whom competing is
just too costly. If regulators think the merger erects walls that
are too high for potential competitors, they might force conditions
on the merging companies _ or even stop the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, health care professionals may see dominance
of one Internet company as a positive that simplifies the industry
and lets other types of providers line up behind one set of
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators will have to decide ``whether higher volumes and
lower cost and greater efficiencies of the combined network will
create such entry barriers that there will never be another
competitor,'' antitrust attorney Robert Burka told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for Arnold to remain chief executive after
the deal is consummated. Michael Long would retain the chief
operating officer job and become co-chairman with Martin Wygod,
currently chairman of Medical Manager and CareInsite.

   ``I'm trying to figure out what's going on, what this guy's up
to,'' he said, referring to Diallo. He would ``peek out,'' then
``slink back,'' he said. Carroll said he also thought Diallo might
have been a lookout for a ``push-in robber,'' who would push his
way into an apartment and, possibly, attack or murder someone
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he and McMellon were the first to approach Diallo.
Carroll testified that as Diallo stood in the vestibule and the
officers were outside on the sidewalk, McMellon displayed his badge
and said: ``Sir, please, New York police. We need a word with
you.'' Then, again, McMellon said, ``Please hold it one second. We
need a word with you,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Diallo then turned away ``as if he wanted to shield
from my view what he might have'' under his jacket. ``I said,
`Police. We want a word with you,''' the officer testified. Diallo
started digging into his pocket with his right hand. ``I heard
Officer McMellon say, `Please show me your hands,''' Carroll said.
Diallo, he said, just didn't want to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, things happened quickly. Diallo seemed to be pulling
an object from his pocket, ``and all I could see was the top slide
of a black gun,'' Carroll said. ``I just said, `Gun. He's got a
gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was pointing the ``gun'' at McMellon, who said, ``What
are you doing? What are you doing?'' Carroll said. He said he
thought McMellon had been shot. In fact, he had backed out of the
building and fallen down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there was rapid gunfire and, Carroll said, it
appeared that muzzle blasts were coming from Diallo's weapon.
Despite being hit by a number of shots, Diallo remained standing,
he said, adding that he thought Diallo must be wearing a
bulletproof vest. Then he began firing at Diallo's legs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although everything seemed like it was going in slow motion,
it was all over in seconds,'' Carroll said. After the shooting
ended and Diallo was on the floor, Carroll grabbed the black object
in the man's hand and realized it was a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   McMellon told a similar story, adding that when the shooting
started he tried to back out of the vestibule ``because I didn't
want to die.'' He fell down the stairs, and continued shooting from
the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither officer would say who fired the first shot. Each said
they were not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Single and 27 years old, McMellon grew up in the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn and attended high school at the School of
Performing Arts. He attended college for several years and joined
the police department in 1993.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, lawyers for the officers recalled Schrrie Elliott, a
witness they had called last week, but who surprised them with
damaging statements about the officers. Having had her declared a
hostile witness, the lawyers were able to cross-examine her about
contradictory statements she had made in the past about the
shooting. She had said that she witnessed it, and that she had
heard one of the officers shout, ``Gun!'' But she also said they
got out of their cars with their guns drawn and never gave Diallo
any warnings.

INTERACTIVE TELEVISION EXCITES ADVERTISING INDUSTRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Build it, and they will come, advertising executives
seem to be saying about interactive television, according to a new
survey.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, interactive television is still a nascent market,
covering anything from full-fledged Internet access over
television, as with Microsoft's Web TV system, to more modest
methods for viewers to interact with television programming, such
as clicking on an icon during a commercial to order products.
</P>
<P>
   Given that such services have yet to take off, the interest
being shown by the executives seems to be somewhat unusual, says
the Myers Group of New York, which conducted the study and recently
sponsored a conference on interactive television in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen the advertising community respond so
proactively to new technology,'' said Jack Myers, the chairman and
chief executive of the Myers Group. ``In the past, they've been
somewhat behind the curve in terms of new technology, reactive
rather than proactive, but with interactive television, they're way
ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 94 percent of the 500 advertising agency,
media- buying and planning executives who responded to the survey
said it was important to explore interactive television
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Of just the media planners and buyers surveyed, 98 percent
called these opportunities important. The survey was conducted late
last summer, before the proposed $165 billion deal between America
Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spaeth, president of the Advertising Research Foundation,
said that it was ``amazing that the generally conservative industry
is poised to jump on the opportunity'' offered by interactive
television.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising industry, he noted ``usually takes a `show me'
attitude; it can be pretty skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   But the findings came as no surprise to others in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got to be interested in this, to better understand
where convergence is going, or they shouldn't be in this
business,'' said Ira Carlin, chairman of Universal McCann, the
media arm of the McCann-Erickson World Group, part of the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, a unit of
Aegis PLC, suggested that interactive TV was generating tremendous
interest because ``people like me are trying to figure out how
advertising will look two or three years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not feeling great about the future of the
30-second commercial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Myers survey also asked the advertising executives to
evaluate 48 broadcast and cable network brands.
</P>
<P>
   For relevance, effective communication and fulfillment of
expectations, the advertising executives picked the A &AMP; E channel
first, followed by ESPN and the Discovery Channel. CNN, NBC, E
Entertainment Television, Fox, Nickelodeon, Lifetime and MTV
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The executives' choices differ from those of 6,500 households
with cable or satellite television that Myers surveyed in late
spring. Those viewers picked the Discovery Channel No. 1 , followed
by the Weather Channel, Learning Channel, PBS and the History
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said that although these findings represent ``a testament
to cable's ascension in the advertising community,'' they also
reveal a significant gap between the views of advertisers and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers look for what serves their needs, while advertisers
look for high ratings and highly targeted demographics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using data compiled from both the advertising and viewer
surveys, as well as other research, the Myers Group has also
identified what it considers emerging cable and online brands with
the greatest potential for rapid advertising growth. America
Online, E and the Weather Channel top the list this year, while the
Game Show Network, the Biography Channel and DoubleClick are rated
the top three for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Myers projects online advertising spending will grow 80 percent
this year, to $4.32 billion. He expects that America Online will
capture ``the major share'' of this growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

TAIL SCREW SEEN AS CULPRIT IN CONTROLLING ALASKA JET  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An investigator at the National Transportation
Safety Board said Monday that experts at the agency were
increasingly convinced that a screw in the tail of an Alaska
Airlines jet was damaged before the plane crashed, and was a factor
in problems controlling the aircraft just before it went down in
the Pacific Ocean last month.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had been seeking to determine whether the damage
to the part was a cause of the crash, or a result. The comments
Monday came as the airline made an unusual public reply to
questions of whether the part had been properly maintained.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Monday, the Federal Aviation
Administration said that two airplanes, one at Delta and one at
AirTran, formerly known as ValuJet, had failed a test that measures
wear in that part.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other planes are to undergo that test in the next 30
days. So far visual inspections have isolated 21 planes with
``positive findings,'' ranging from metallic grit in the grease,
which may be a sign of normal wear, to shavings, which are not.
</P>
<P>
   Under scrutiny is the jackscrew, similar to the screw that
drives a garage door, only shorter and thicker, and a nut that
rides up and down the screw as it turns to raise and lower part of
the tail called the horizontal stabilizer. The horizontal
stabilizer makes the nose of the plane point up or down.
</P>
<P>
   When the screw was recovered by the Navy off the coast of Los
Angeles after the July 31 crash, it was partly wrapped in metal
ribbon, apparently stripped off from the nut.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator said Monday that if the damage had occurred in
the crash itself, it would have been more localized _ confined to
the area where the nut had rested on the screw.
</P>
<P>
   The crew reported to mechanics on the ground that they could not
control the horizontal stabilizer. The final cause of the crash,
which killed all 88 aboard, is less clear, however, since
investigators have determined from the flight data recorder, also
recovered from the ocean, that after the stabilizer flipped to a
full nose-down position, the crew regained control and flew on,
experimenting with lowering the flaps and making preparations for
landing.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, James E. Hall, the board chairman, released a
statement saying that when the screw and nut were last inspected in
September 1997, it was measured as having the maximum allowable
amount of play, and that the initial plan was to replace it.
Keeping the nut still and seeing how far the jackscrew will wiggle
is the approved method for looking for wear in the mechanism. But
the airline re-checked five times and found that the play was well
within tolerances, the safety board said.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline said that the first measurement showed play at
forty-thousandths of an inch, which is at the allowable limit, and
that subsequent measurements showed it was at 33 thousandths of an
inch, well within the limit. The MD-80 maintenance manual, drafted
by Boeing, adopted by Alaska Airlines and approved by the FAA, says
that the test should be repeated ``several times to ensure
consistent results,'' the airline pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You check and re-check and recheck,'' said Louis Cancelmi, a
spokesman for the airline, which is based in Seattle. ``That's what
aviation is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other maintenance experts, with long experience at other
airlines, said it would not be unusual to send a second mechanic
and inspector to re-measure a part if fine tolerances were
involved. ``I would have a second set of eyes,'' said a maintenance
director at another major airline.
</P>
<P>
   The part, which is sold as a combination jackscrew and nut,
sells for $57,000, according to an airline that flies more than 100
planes that use them. But it seldom requires replacement, according
to a spokesman for that airline, who asked that he and his company
not be named. He said that in the last 20 years, the company had
replaced only three.
</P>
<P>
   Other maintenance experts suggested that if an airline was
seeking to cut corners, time would have been a bigger factor than
money, if locating a replacement would delay the plane's return to
revenue service.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive wear in the jackscrew or nut could make the weight of
the tail rest on less and less metal surface, eventually leading to
the nut stripping, according to experts. The screw is a hard steel,
but the nut is a softer material, an alloy of aluminum, nickel and
bronze, according to Mark Silk, president of Trig Holding Inc., the
manufacturer. The reason is that if both parts were steel, they
would not move smoothly against each other, according to
metallurgists.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the FAA said Monday that it might not have a full
count of problems with jackscrews until the middle of this week.
Last week when the agency ordered the visual inspections within
three days, it also ordered tests to measure play, within 30 days,
although some airlines, to save time, did both at once.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also shortened the interval between play tests, to three
months from eight. One issue that the crash raises, according to
experts, is whether to test more frequently, or to base the test
interval on the amount of play observed in each test.

   CHICAGO _ Shares of the Maytag Corp., the giant appliance maker,
fell sharply Monday after the company warned that earnings this
year would not meet Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which makes everything from Magic Chef oven ranges
and refrigerators to Hoover vacuum cleaners, said first quarter
earnings could be down 10 percent from a year ago because of fierce
competition in the market for home applicances and weaker than
expected sales of its soft drink vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was the second in three quarters for Maytag, which
sharply reduced its earnings forecast for the third quarter of
1999, blaming weaker sales of its low-cost home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The first warning sent shares of Maytag tumbling. After reaching
a high of $74 last May, shares fell to about $31.25 a share in
October, partly because it came shortly after Maytag officials had
assured Wall Street that profit growth was on track. Maytag shares
later climbed to about $50 a share through early this year partly
because of a strong fourth-quarter profit. But in the past few
weeks, the company's shares have tumbled again.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, shares of Maytag dropped $3.875, to close at $32.50, on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag advised Wall Street analysts to drop their year 2000
forecasts to the lower end of the $3.80 to $4.00 range. They did.
Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities, revised
his earnings downward to $3.60 a share from $4.00. Russell Leavitt
of Banc of America Securities changed to $3.75 from $4.00.
</P>
<P>
   The company is going through a rough period, the analysts say,
and the stock price reflects that. But several analysts said the
company is expected to recover, if not later this year, perhaps
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some choppy air in earnings,'' Heymann said. ``We've
lost a year's worth of earnings growth this year. But the company
is in good shape, it generates lots of cash; but it needs some
things straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maytag officials say they are moving in that direction. The
slowdown will not disrupt plans to introduce a new line of
innovative products, executives say. The company says it is
preparing for a time in the near future when home appliances are
smarter and perhaps even connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alliance with Microsoft that could lead to smart
appliances and a partnership with the Sanyo Electric Co. of Japan
to develop more efficient home appliances. In the second half of
the year, the company projects a pickup in business, with earnings
climbing 15 to 20 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The current slowdown, company officials say, is tied largely to
the company's Dixie-Narco vending machines, which are supplied to
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo among other soft drink companies. Maytag said
orders were down sharply and a recovery might not come until early
next year. The company also said its Hoover vacuum business had
weakened because of stiff competition for bagless, upright vacuums.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag's line of Neptune and Performa washing machines and
Gemini oven ranges, however, continue to sell briskly.

 &HT;    So far, changes going nowhere
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ And now, we return to ``The Season of the Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost, as in playoff opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Lost, as in player commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Lost, as in direction and hope and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are 47 miles into an 82-mile journey, already
dangerously low on fuel, almost out of coolant. The 13 occupants
don't know each other well and don't play well together.
</P>
<P>
   The driver hasn't exactly lost control. The most obstreperous
passenger just tunes him out; the others nod and go their separate
ways.
</P>
<P>
   This season has been a disaster for the Hawks. Maybe there's a
payoff down the line. Isn't that why team president Stan Kasten and
General Manager Pete Babcock, even coach Lenny Wilkens, agreed to
dump the team's strong, veteran presence and take a lower road?
</P>
<P>
   None of the reasons for losing Steve Smith, Mookie Blaylock,
Grant Long and Ty Corbin has changed. In their advancing years,
they were only going to go so far, and they were going to stop far
short of a championship.
</P>
<P>
   But change didn't have to mean half-hearted effort and a stodgy
offense damaged by half-hearted defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Magic, which followed a similar plan, is two games
below .500 and 3 1/2 games better than the Hawks. Showing the
benefits of hiring diverse players who are fighting for new
contracts, they are gritty fighters under Doc Rivers. Even after an
eight-game losing streak, the Magic is right there in the fight for
a 4-8 seeding. The team has no hidden agendas.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said about the Hawks. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dikembe Mutombo, first in the NBA in rebounding, second in
shooting percentage, third in blocked shots, is having a stellar
season while disowning his new teammates. ``I didn't make these
changes,'' Mutombo said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alan Henderson has regained his competitive edge and sometimes
turns it into blind rage. Woe to the referee who misses a call.
Five technicals so far and a whisker away from at least one
ejection. Henderson, who has a strong move to the basket, is a
power forward who would rather shoot jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  J.R. Rider is strangling on his own game. See him come off a
screen. Fake the open shot. Stop. Look. Dribble. Wait for the
double team. Fire the fadeaway. Amble back on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to shoot unless there's a strong degree of
difficulty,'' analyst Steve Jones said from the vantage point of
one who watched Rider almost daily for three years in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers for the team's leading scorer have dropped off
precipitously. Since peaking a dozen agames ago at 23.5 points per
game, .429 from the field and .796 from the line, Rider has
averaged 18 points and shot .387 from the field and .760 from the
line. Despite the drop off at the line, Rider shoots technicals,
ahead of Jim Jackson, No. 7 in the league at .871.
</P>
<P>
   Is this season Mutombo's fault, because he disdains the
newcomers? Or Henderson's, because his ego and temper get in the
way of what was once a strong supporting role? Or Rider's, because
he has not responded to Wilkens' patient, non-confrontational
handling?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. The emotional Mutombo relied on Blaylock to
complement his defensive skills, on Smith for emotional support and
a sound game and on Long for his selfless inside play.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson labors under the delusion that as a senior man the
stature of prime-time player is his due.
</P>
<P>
   And Rider is the same guy who drove them crazy in Portland, and
before that in Minnesota, with a few rough edges smoothed away. Do
we blame LaPhonso Ellis, whose body has broken down so often he no
longer wants to take the punishment inside where he once excelled?
Or Bimbo Coles, who plays to his limits, or Jason Terry, who needs
to grow up as a pro, or Jackson, who is better than advertised but
is a guard, not a full-time small forward?
</P>
<P>
   Do we blame Wilkens, who was handed the keys and told to drive?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Babcock takes the hit; he made the deals. Or Kasten; he
approved them. Or the bosses who trust them to do the right thing.
Didn't they say there would be no drop off in talent? Didn't we
believe it?
</P>
<P>
   Blame everybody: There's enough to go around. Meanwhile, we will
have to wait to see if there was anything to Kasten's threat to
dismantle this team by the Feb. 24 trade deadline. We also will
have to see if the Hawks draw one through eight in the lottery and
keep the draft pick that otherwise goes to the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, like Wilkens, we wait to see who is invited to camp in
October or how the Hawks handle the big chunk of salary-cap room
they will get in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Wait is all we can do.
</P>

 &HT;    New UGA coach soured on Oklahoma
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Gary Gibbs resigned as head coach at Oklahoma in
1994, he sounded like someone who wanted no more of coaching _
ever. One couldn't blame him.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, a linebacker on Oklahoma's 1974 national championship
team, had inherited a troubled program from Barry Switzer, who was
forced to resign in 1989. Oklahoma was on NCAA probation, which
included a two-year postseason ban. Many Sooners players spent more
time on the police blotter than in the sports pages. Gibbs called
the place ``a hell hole'' when he took over.
</P>
<P>
   He posted six winning seasons in a row and made three bowl
trips, but it wasn't enough. The Sooners were 2-14-1 against their
three biggest rivals _ Texas, Colorado and Nebraska _ and were no
longer national contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs cleaned up the program and kept winning. But the fans
wanted Switzer, warts and all, and they weren't bashful about
saying it. After a 1992 loss to Texas, Gibbs was doused with beer
from angry fans.
</P>
<P>
   When the harassment trickled to his family _ his two daughters
were 13 and 10 at the time _ Gibbs announced his resignation on the
Monday before the 1994 regular-season finale with Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my family started asking me why they and I were being
harassed and insulted and our coaches were not being appreciated, I
started asking myself some tough questions,'' Gibbs said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs left football and went into private business. He tried
insurance. He worked with Nebraska coach Tom Osborne making
instructional videos, and said he missed working with players and
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Friends would ask whether he was ever going to return to college
football. Gibbs wondered the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty good football coach and I certainly know more
about X's and O's than I did about insurance,'' Gibbs said. ``Deep
down, I knew I would get back into it. I just didn't know when.''
</P>
<P>
   That time came Sunday night when Gibbs accepted Jim Donnan's
offer to become the defensive coordinator at Georgia. They had
worked together as coordinators at Oklahoma from 1985-88. When
Gibbs became head coach, Donnan remained as his offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia position is the first coaching job that Gibbs even
considered since he left Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a great opportunity to work with a guy I like and
respect,'' Gibbs said. ``It was just too good to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming head coach, Gibbs was Oklahoma's defensive
coordinator for eight years (1981-88). From 1984-87, Oklahoma
finished first nationally in total defense three times and second
once.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs says five years away from the game have not dulled his
skills. If anything, the time off has made him hungry again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had confidence in my ability, and now I get a
chance to return in one of the great programs in the country,'' he
said. ``I can't wait to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GARY GIBBS FILE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Born: Aug. 13, 1952, in Beaumont, Texas.

   GA-STORMS (Camilla, Ga.) _ Attacking under cover of darkness and
with little warning, a streak of tornadoes rumbled through
southwest Georgia early Monday morning, killing at least 22 people,
injuring more than 100 and transforming peaceful subdivisions into
wastelands of debris. Because the storms began just before
midnight, many sleeping residents had no idea they were at risk
until they heard the cracking of pine trees and the shattering of
window panes. Some did not even have time to get out of bed and
into a closet.

POLICE CORRUPTION CASE DRAWS QUIET RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Rodriguez remembers his two and a half years
in prison on murder and drug charges as a journey through shades of
blackness. He refused to allow his youngest son to visit him. He
lost a promising job as a salesman at a software company. The gangs
that he had tried to escape by leaving central Los Angeles
surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening his despair was the ridicule that he endured from
fellow inmates when he talked about being exonerated. ``I told
them, `I think I'm gonna beat this thing,' that I was framed by the
police,'' recalled Rodriguez, 30. ``They laughed and said: `Man,
you don't understand. Nobody beats the cops in this town. Nobody's
gonna believe you!'''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Rodriguez was indeed acquitted of the murder charge.
He subsequently served time for drug possession, but he is now free
and is suing the police because, he said, they fabricated evidence
against him and conducted an illegal search. The trumped-up murder
charge, he said, led to his drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he has company. His is one of scores of lawsuits
charging the police with a range of abuses in what has already
become the largest scandal in the history of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the most egregious examples of brutality disclosed,
Rodriguez's case underscores the complex course the scandal is now
taking and helps explain the surprisingly quiescent attitude of the
public and many politicians in response to repeated disclosures of
unjustified shootings, beatings, lying and fabricating of evidence
by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people now filing lawsuits are, like Rodriguez,
current or former gang members with arrest records, precisely the
kinds of people that police officers had been trained to
intimidate.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the public reluctant to express outrage over the
mistreatment of such people, but many of the civil suits now
emerging are not as clear-cut as some of the first cases that came
to light.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez admitted, for instance, that he had marijuana in his
home when he was arrested on the murder charge, but he has insisted
the search was illegal because it was based on evidence fabricated
by the police.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Cynthia Diaz, who admitted that she was
addicted to crack, is suing the police for breaking into her
apartment, stealing thousands of dollars and various appliances,
and forcing her to flee briefly to Arizona in fear for her life.
</P>
<P>
   In neither case have the police acknowledged wrongdoing, and if
the cases come to trial they may rely on testimony from people who
are still in prison _ as Diaz's boyfriend is _ or people with
criminal records, raising the same troubling issues of credibility
that Rodriguez had once confronted in the darkness of his cell.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts the depth of the corruption. Some 70 police
officers are reportedly under investigation, and more than 40
convictions have been or are in the process of being overturned by
the office of District Attorney Gil Garcetti, with the promise of
more to come. The city is preparing for what some estimate could be
over $200 million in settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been only a few calls for an independent
investigation and little in the way of public demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about people who belonged in prison, just not
for those reasons,'' a former police official said. ``The police
may have stepped over the line, but they had to be tough with these
people, let's be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor added: ``The broad majority of citizens in this
city don't care that a bunch of drug dealers have been put in jail
on trumped-up charges. The guilty going free is more politically
volatile than the innocent being declared guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reform advocates expressed anger over such attitudes.
``That to me is so utterly corrupt, so utterly corrosive,'' said
Merrick J. Bobb, a special counsel to the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department and a former counsel to a police reform
commission after the beating of Rodney King in the early 1990s.
``That's what's really frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobb and others say they are not optimistic about the prospects
for changes, because of the lack of public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no video in this instance,'' he said. ``There was no
personality for this to coalesce around. The victims are gang
members. They don't command public sympathy. That has stopped the
community from coming together on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many experts say the evidence shows that the abuses
were widespread, and insist that reforms will be required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was aberrational at all,'' said Paul Marks,
a retired police captain in Los Angeles, in response to assertions
by some police officials that the abuses were limited to the
Rampart Division, a station west of downtown. ``I was disappointed
when this came out, but not surprised. I'm telling you, this goes
on outside Rampart. It's not just going on at the lower levels of
the department. It couldn't be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was raised in the Rampart neighborhood by his mother.
She worked two jobs, he said, and he was alone most of the time. He
joined one of the most notorious gangs in the city, the 18th Street
gang, he said, in 1982. He was 12.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that he constantly tangled with police officers from
the anti-gang division. But his problems began in 1996. He had
moved in 1994 to West Covina, a city about 15 miles east of Los
Angeles, with his girlfriend and three children. He got a job as a
technical support officer and a salesman at a software company. He
was going to college at night.
</P>
<P>
   But a phone call at 4 a.m. changed all that, he said. Police
officers were on the line, saying that his house was surrounded,
that they had a warrant for his arrest and that they wanted him to
come out, unarmed, with his hands up.
</P>
<P>
   He said his arrest report was filled with police errors. And the
police kept referring to him, he said, as ``Clever,'' when his old
street name had been ``Oso.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he came close to accepting a plea agreement and a
10-year jail term, because of his doubts that the system could ever
work for him.
</P>
<P>
   But he decided to fight and he was eventually acquitted on the
murder charge. But he was immediately imprisoned on charges that
when he was arrested some marijuana was found. He accepted a plea
bargain, he said. In all, he was in prison from Feb. 5, 1997, until
last July.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz moved here from New York when she was 6 years old. ``I was
a Rampart Police Explorer,'' she said. ``I was with this group that
used to spend time at the station. We'd ride along with the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her life changed when, at 17, she became pregnant. When
she had the baby, her mother told her to forget her dream of
joining the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sort of lost it after that,'' said Diaz, 35. ``I just
sort of started hanging out.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she developed a drug habit and was convicted of drug
possession, for which she was put on probation.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day she left her apartment in the Rampart neighborhood
with $50, to pay the weekly rent, and an officer jammed a gun in
her face.
</P>
<P>
   She said the officer handcuffed her and threw her against a
wall. She was eventually taken back to her apartment where, she
said, the officers insisted that she and her boyfriend hand over
drugs and provide the names of dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she said, she told the officers where to find $2,700 in
cash hidden behind a heater. The policemen took the money and left.
Diaz and her boyfriend fled, only to discover later that the
officers had returned, she said, and walked off with their
television, VCR, camcorder, pager and some jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually her boyfriend was imprisoned on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he wants a normal life, if one can be salvaged.
He is working at an aluminum plant by day, while going to college
at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry, but I'm trying not to be angry in a negative way,''
said Rodriguez. ``If you let yourself be like that, you give that
attitude to your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``When I see those cops go to court, I'll know justice
is being done.''

   TROY, Mich. _ The popular perception that Michigan elections are
still dominated by legions of auto workers toting lunch pails is as
dated as a Chevrolet Citation.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in New Hampshire and South Carolina, a new economy, in
which auto workers wear white collars, has generated a new
electorate, whose party affiliations are loose and whose votes are
hard to predict. Those voters have already helped change Michigan
politics in recent years, and, according to the latest polls, they
could be crucial in determining who wins the state's Republican
presidential primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new, high-tech professionals are people like Joel Gibson, a
26-year-old car-engine software designer, whose father, grandfather
and great-grandmother were all auto factory workers and staunch
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lean Republican, but I like to look at each individual
candidate,'' said Gibson, who said he likes former Sen. Bill
Bradley and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The new workers tend to vote Republican in state and local
elections, but they have proved unpredictable in contests for
national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may identify themselves as Republicans, but when they
pull that curtain, the independent streak kicks in, much to my
chagrin,'' said one Republican officerholder, L. Brooks Patterson,
the Oakland County executive.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson knows those voters well, because it is here in Oakland
County, in Detroit's northwestern suburbs, that they tend to make
their homes. Macomb County, which lies along Oakland's eastern
boundary and is characterized by strip malls and small ranch-style
houses, remains the home of the so-called Reagan Democrats _ union
workers attracted to the Republicans' appeal to traditional values.
But Oakland County has dozens of auto engineering centers that have
sprung up in rows of new, tinted-glass office towers as starkly
anonymous as any in Silicon Valley, and tens of thousands of the
new workers live here.
</P>
<P>
   Dotted with small lakes surrounded by beautiful homes,
crisscrossed by freeways increasingly lined by those engineering
centers, Oakland County has 1.2 million people and is growing twice
as fast as Macomb County, with a population of 770,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland is where many of these people live, and is going to be
a battleground going into the future,'' said Jennifer Granholm, a
Democrat who was elected the state's attorney general in 1998
partly by doing well in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Granholm is a fairly recent arrival, having grown up in San
Francisco. Other recent arrivals, including many engineers, have
more than offset the constant stream of retirees moving South and
have raised the state's population to almost 10 million, from 9.3
million people in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and pollsters from across the political spectrum
give similar descriptions of the new workers: conservative on
economic issues, particularly in their skepticism about government
regulation, but moderate on social policy. They have helped
Republicans take control of both houses of the state Legislature as
well as the governor's mansion. But the new workers have also been
willing to vote for Democrats in national elections: Bill Clinton
beat former Sen. Bob Dole in Oakland County in 1996, and nearly
beat President George Bush in 1992. That inclination has
increasingly made them the swing voters in a state that is among
the nation's most evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the ones who come across and vote for the Democrats
who win in Michigan,'' said Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster in
Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But while Macomb County, characterized by strip malls and small,
ranch-style houses, remains the home of the so-called Reagan
Democrats _ union workers attracted to the Republicans' appeal to
traditional values _ the changing face of the work force has
brought a changing face to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The number of unionized industrial workers as a proportion of
all voters in the state has dropped by nearly half in the last two
decades, to etween 6 and 9 percent, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   Auto production remains the state's dominant industry, but
automakers and auto parts companies are changing the way they do
business. For instance, while much of the actual manufacturing has
either been automated or moved to Southern states and overseas, to
take advantage of lower wages elsewhere, all but eight of the
nation's 200 auto parts engineering centers are now in Michigan,
instead of being scattered across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the growth in the tech jobs has really been
pretty profound and probably better than a lot of other parts of
the country,'' said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of General
Motors. ``It has changed the profile of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's long economic expansion has been particularly good
to the highly cyclical auto industry, like a prolonged return to
the early 1960s, before automakers' profits were crippled by
foreign competition and, arguably, government safety and
environmental regulations. The arts are flourishing in Detroit,
with the opening of a cavernous opera house and the restoration of
a magnificent symphony hall. Housing prices have been rising faster
across this metropolitan area than almost anywhere else in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   An acute shortage of skilled labor has kept Michigan's
unemployment rate below the national average since 1995. The
state's rate was just 3.6 percent in December, and the state plans
to start spending as much advertising for engineers to move here as
it previously spent to persuade businesses to relocate here.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's shift in employment toward white-collar jobs has
occurred on a massive scale. The number of unionized auto workers
in Michigan has plunged to fewer than 250,000 from 479,000 in 1980.
But total employment in the auto industry, the state says, has only
inched down to 471,000 from 507,000 two decades ago, and actually
grew in the 1990s.

 TROY, Mich.: state government. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Pontiac, several miles west of here, GM recently gutted and
remodeled two assembly plants with the combined floor space of the
Empire State Building, turning them into offices and laboratories
for 8,500 engineers.
</P>
<P>
   GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler can afford such grandiose
undertakings: They were the world's three largest companies in
1998, in terms of sales and share of global economic output. While
rising oil prices may have moved the Exxon Mobil Corp. into the
lead since then, auto companies continue to dwarf the rest of
corporate America. The nation's total retail sales of all products
over the Internet last year are estimated at $10 billion to $15
billion, but Americans buy $15 billion a year worth of GM's
Chevrolet Silverado pickups alone.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll a week ago by The Detroit Free Press found that
Gov. George W. Bush and McCain were evenly matched if Democrats and
independents voted in the Republican primary in fairly large
numbers, while Bush was ahead among registered Republicans. The
poll also showed that McCain enjoyed a sizable advantage in Macomb
County, partly because of Reagan Democrats, while Bush commanded
strong support in western Michigan, where abortion opponents are
numerous and active and have been leery of the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland County was a toss-up when Democrats and independents
were included, while Bush prevailed among only Republicans, the
poll showed.
</P>
<P>
   One issue on which Bush could ultimately prove vulnerable here
is government regulation. Michigan Republicans regularly deride
Gore for saying in his book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' that the
contribution to global warming from automobiles with
internal-combustion engines is ``a mortal threat to the security of
every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we
are ever again likely to confront.'' The Republicans are eager to
attack Gore on the issue should he win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But whether they would be able to do so with Bush as the
Republican nominee is uncertain. Criticized last autumn by
environmentalists in New England television advertisements, Bush
announced in New Hampshire last December that he had asked Texas
regulators to consider adopting California's new auto pollution
rules, which are stricter than the federal government's and are
particularly tough on high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks. The regulators held hearings on the idea during the week of
the New Hampshire primary, and the conservative Detroit News sent a
reporter to Texas to cover them. The resulting story emphasized
that GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler sold 90 percent of the sport
utilities and pickup trucks in Texas, and ran under a big headline,
``Bush Cleanup Plan to Cut Truck Sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond environmental regulation lies the broader landscape
of a changing work force and changing politics here. Dwayne F.
Davidson, a 41-year-old GM manager, is a Republican leaning toward
Bush, trusting him to keep government small. Davidson said he
agreed on few political issues with his father, a lifelong Democrat
who spent 30 years welding car body panels in the same giant
building in Pontiac where the son now oversees the design of sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hung out with Republicans, I golf with Republicans,''
Davidson said, ``It has kind of rubbed off.''

ONLINE CHATS MAY POINT TO SUSPECTS IN WEB-SITE ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Canada)  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF and SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Evidence fueling the hunt for suspects in the
recent attacks on leading Web sites may have been found in a set of
online conversations secretly monitored by computer security
experts before and during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations were recorded by security experts at Stanford
University and at Kroll-O'Gara, a computer consulting firm, from an
online chat system known as Internet Relay Chat. The system is
widely used by computer hobbyists and is frequently used for
anonymous communications between computer criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Five pieces of independent evidence including the intercepted
conversations point to one possible suspect, according to David
Brumley, a computer security officer at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   A network of computers at a Stanford-run oceanographic research
laboratory in Monterey, Calif., was among those used by outsiders
to relay at stream of data that overwhelmed eBay, the Internet
auction site, for several hours last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four or five pieces of independent evidence that are
leading toward one person,'' said Brumley, ``and we give the FBI
every piece of evidence we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Brumley said he had intercepted a conversation in which the
suspect had asked his friends to name a site ``they really hated''
so he could attack it.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's friends replied, ``eBay,'' Brumley said, and about
30 minutes later ``eBay went down.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had gathered other information pinpointing the city
in which the suspect resides. He would not name the city but said
he had given that and other information to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing in the chats is someone saying something is
going to happen, and then it happens,'' Brumley added.
</P>
<P>
   Even before last week's attacks, security experts like Brumley
were routinely capturing and archiving conversations on chat
channels with the purpose of saving the information so it can be
correlated against other data in tracking computer criminals.
</P>
<P>
   A Kroll-O'Gara computer security consultant, Joel de la Garza,
said data recorded in the Stanford case indicated that the
individual is a high school dropout who is self-taught in computer
programming and has developed relatively advanced programming
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recorded conversations come from a chat channel
named ``goonies.'' The channel, which permits a number of computer
users to share a typed conversation, has been a cyberspace hangout
for young computer vandals involved in a variety of illicit
activities. Last week, after the channel was identified to
reporters and some computer security experts, it was closed to
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the suspect who has been tracked through chat
conversations, a second person with the Internet handle Mafiaboy
has become a subject of suspicion after claiming responsibility for
some attacks. That person has been tracked by computer security
experts for several years and they believe he lives in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But Brumley down Mafiaboy's role, saying, ``We're not
sure how much hard evidence there is.''
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Mafiaboy and the other suspect described by
Brumley was reported Monday in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the attacks, computer security experts who monitor the
computer underground said, there have been many such claims of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the focus on evidence unearthed at Stanford may be
unwarranted; law enforcement officials cautioned Monday that they
are not making public or private statements about their criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying a lot of things, and I'm not sure
if anyone has a complete picture,'' said an FBI agent, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it may be particularly difficult to find the
perpetrators of last week's high-profile incidents is that the type
of attack, known as denial of service, is a frequent occurrence on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before the attack on Yahoo, eBay and others, computer
administrators at the University of California at Berkeley said the
school's network had been under a similar attack beginning on
Friday, Feb. 4, and lasting through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Another short-lived attack was reported against Nextcard, the
Internet credit card company, for two hours on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   And the Canadian-based site for HMV, the record chain, said
Monday that it had been temporarily disabled on Feb. 7, the same
day as the attack on Yahoo, by a similar onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been attacks like this in the past, just not at
this kind of level,'' said Rose Klimovich, director of Global IP
Network Services at AT&AMP;T. ``What it has done is heightened people's
awareness across the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday President Clinton plans to meet at the White House
with as many as two dozen executives of computer and Internet
companies to develop strategies to combat computer crime. In
addition to the president, Commerce Secretary William Daley; the
president's chief of staff, John Podesta, and the national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, are expected to attend.

 &HT;    Harrell family one of many affected by tornado
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Ga. _ At Sunday night church, Vickie Gainous couldn't
help but be distracted by 18-month-old Kylie Rae Harrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That baby looked so pretty in her blue denim dress,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At noontime Monday, Gainous was retrieving that same dress from
a field where the baby and her mother Shannon were hurled to their
deaths by the tornado that swept throughout southwest Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous and the other sorrowful gleaners, friends of the
Harrells, stepped through the muck along rows of kale and collards
to salvage pieces of the family's possessions. The Harrells' mobile
home had been blown to the far end of the field, a good 500 yards
from the spot beside Ridge Road where it had been anchored to its
cinder block foundation. The field of greens was littered with
small shreds of shattered dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Death claimed half the Harrell family. Todd Harrell, 32, and his
stepdaughter Brittany, 11, survived with minor injuries and were in
stable condition Monday evening in a Cairo hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we know we had two miracles,'' said Annette Harrell,
Todd Harrell's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Of her daughter-in-law, she said: ``She loved her children with
all her heart. She and Todd put their marriage ahead of everything
else but the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day before they died, she said, Shannon Harrell took the
baby to get photo portraits made. The little girl was wearing the
blue denim dress.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harrell said his son, from his hospital bed, was able to
tell him about the night of the twister.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 a.m., Todd Harrell said, he phoned a friend and told him
he and his family were getting ready to flee their home. But as
soon as he opened the front door, he was hit by overwhelming wind
pressure. All he could do was get back to his family and try to lie
down on the hall floor.
</P>
<P>
   He could feel the wind pull the mobile home from its
underpinnings, but he blacked out as the trailer broke loose and
started tumbling across the field.
</P>
<P>
   Once the storm had passed, he regained consciousness and was
able to find Brittany and make it to a neighbor's home, which had
suffered only roof damage. In the dark and rain, no one could spot
Shannon Harrell and the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Friends arrived, loaded Todd Harrell and Brittany into their
trucks and rushed them to the hospital in Cairo, about five miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, all that could be done was for friends from the
Harrells' church, Pine Level Baptist, to come to the obliterated
home site and try to find salvagable scraps _ and to talk about
their devastated neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of faith. They trusted in God for everything,''
said Duane Davis, who works with Todd Harrell at a farm credit
agency in Camilla.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who lives nearby, said he came to help search in the
middle of the night. He was one of the searchers who came upon the
baby's body in the field, lying near part of a broken water heater.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday morning, Davis went to the hospital to tell
Brittany that Cody, the family's Labrador retriever, was safe. The
dog had come to Davis' home before the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the daylight hours, Davis' wife, Voncille, scoured the field,
looking for quilts and baby blankets made by Todd's grandmother.
She said today was to have been a special day for Todd and Shannon
Harrell.
</P>
<P>
   Todd was leaving the agency in Camilla for a job in Florida, and
his last day in the office was to be Wednesday. His co-workers were
planning a farewell luncheon for him today.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon had planned to go into town today and use a gift
certificate Todd had given her for a massage at a health spa, prior
to joining him for the luncheon. Voncille Davis had been looking
forward to babysitting Kylie Ray for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Belinda Smith said her friend Shannon was taking classes on the
Internet, working toward a certificate in medical administration,
until she got pregnant with Kylie Rae.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Harrells' family life was centered around
their church. Todd serves as a lay minister in the Royal Ambassador
program, working with young boys in the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who worked with the same program when Todd was a
boy, said knowing the depth of the couple's faith is helping her
endure the pain of the loss of her granddaughter and
daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine the pain of any parent being in a hospital
waiting room like this and not knowing the condition of their
child's heart,'' she said. ``I know Shannon was a Christian, and
that can get you through anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd and Shannon Harrell apparently let anyone who visited their
home see their faith on display. One of the few things their
friends salvaged intact was an afghan embroidered with a Biblical
verse.
</P>
<P>
   Draped over a twisted piece of irrigation pipe in thefield, the
verse, I Corinthians 13, reads: ``Love bears all things, believes
all things, hopes all things, endures all things.''

 DoubleClick, Under Fire, Vows to Shut Doors on Online Marketers  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bowing to concerns by privacy advocates, Internet advertising
company DoubleClick Inc. yesterday announced steps to help
consumers ``opt out'' of having their personal data used for online
marketing.
<P>
   But consumer watchdogs were unimpressed. ``It's an empty
promise,'' said David Sobel, general counsel of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for New York's DoubleClick, the largest
advertising network. The FTC has vowed to regulate online marketers
if they don't adequately address privacy concerns. Last week, EPIC
sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing DoubleClick
of ``unfair and deceptive business practices.''
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick, the largest Web ad manager, sends banner ads to a
network of 1,500 sites. By attaching ``cookies'' to a computer
user's hard drive, DoubleClick creates anonymous user profiles
based on which ads the Web surfer has seen and clicked on.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, DoubleClick came under fire for linking that online
behavioral data with information obtained from catalog companies,
which includes names, addresses, and purchase information of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, DoubleClick ran ads in the New York Times, San Jose
Mercury News, Washington Post and Roll Call, a newspaper about
Capitol Hill, to convince both consumers and policymakers that it
is committed to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   It also will send out 50 million banner ads with the goal of
reaching ``slightly more than half'' of the United States' 80
million to 90 million Web users, said Kevin Ryan, DoubleClick's
president, in a telephone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which will cost DoubleClick more than $1 million,
direct consumers to a DoubleClick a Web site, privacychoices.org.
There, computer users can ask the company to stop tracking their
online behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Sobel said surfers are unlikely to respond to the ads
because most have no idea that DoubleClick sends them the ads they
see as the traverse the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``People who go looking for this type of information read the
privacy policies on the sites they visit, like CNN.com or
whatever,'' said Sobel. ``That doesn't work with DoubleClick
because their collection of information is invisible to the user.''
</P>
<P>
   EPIC does not object to DoubleClick tracking online behavior as
long as the tracking maintains individuals' anonymity. DoubleClick
uses anonymous profiles to make sure it doesn't send people the
same ad too many times.
</P>
<P>
   But Sobel said the marrying of names and addresses collected
offline with online sufing data violates a privacy policy
DoubleClick published on its Web site in 1997 and 1998, which
promised that its profiles would remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said EPIC's contention is ``completely without merit.''
DoubleClick ``has committed that in the future we won't sell
information unless people have notice and choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the advertising campaign, DoubleClick said it
would set up an advisory board that would include consumer
advocates; hire an outside firm ``to perform periodic privacy
audits''; and create a new position, chief privacy officer, to
focus on privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   For surfers who visit privacychoices.org to opt out of
information collection, DoubleClick installs a special cookie on
the user's hard drive that prevents future DoubleClick cookies from
being installed. DoubleClick does not plan to link offline data
with existing surfer profiles.

 Phone.com to Acquire Onebox.com  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Phone.com, a Redwood City software company whose ``minibrowser''
helps cell-phone users surf the Net, announced plans yesterday to
buy Onebox.com, a San Mateo company that lets customers access
e-mail, voice mail and faxes via a single Web site.
<P>
   Executives said the $787 million stock deal will give Phone.com
additional services to offer its customers, which include wireless
phone companies like AT&AMP;T and Sprint, for a few dollars per account
per month. Phone.com already offers e-mail, but not voice mail or
fax.
</P>
<P>
   It is Phone.com's third acquisition in recent months. A week
ago, it completed its acquisition of AtMotion, a Redwood Shores
voice recognition company. Last week, it agreed to buy Paragon
Software, an English firm that lets users download calender
information on cell phones, for $497 million. Onebox says it has
2.5 million registered users, more than half of whom use the
service regularly. Onebox had less than $1million in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Linder, Phone.com's vice president of marketing, said such
``unified messaging'' services are ``very much in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder pointed out that many cell phone companies already give
away voice mail to encourage customers to make more calls, both to
retrieve messages and respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, phone companies want to let users accept
faxes through their cell phones to encourage them to hand out their
cell phone number more freely. ``In Europe, most people put their
cell phone number on their business card,'' Linder noted. Yet many
Americans keep the numbers relatively private, giving them out only
to family and selected co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most cell phones today can't read faxes. Most customers
would only be able to use their phone to forward the message on to
the nearest fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   But Onebox chief executive Ross Bott said a new wave of cell
phone will let users view faxes anywhere. Nokia recently introduced
such a phone, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Bott, who will be chief operating officer of Phone.com, also
envisions customers being able to use Phone.com's voice recognition
software to dictate e-mail messages, a handy feature considering
most cell phones lack keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   He said Onebox was planning to market its services to cell phone
companies anyway, so it was a good fit with Phone.com. The firms
wrapped up a deal in just seven days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, though, shrugged off the acquisition. Phone.com
shares closed down $2.63, to $118.50, yesterday, reducing the value
of the deal to $770 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are expressing their opinion,'' Linder said, pointing out
that stocks often fall when companies make acquisitions over
concerns that the deal could hurt short-term earnings. Phone.com's
stock has risen fifteenfold since it went public last year.
</P>
<P>
   Onebox has about 70 workers, compared with 500 for Phone.com,
making the deal worth roughly $11 million per Onebox worker. Bott
said he didn't know how many would become millionaires but said
such overnight successes are now an oft-told story in Silicon
Valley. ``It's becoming pretty boring.''
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are planned, though Bott said the companies'
corporate headquarters probably will eventually be combined in one
location.

 E-Trade's Clicks Get Bricks  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
E-Trade Group, the company that has come to symbolize the wired
world of Internet brokerage, is about to set up shop. A real shop.
<P>
   The nation's No. 2 online broker will open a walk-in office on
Manhattan's exclusive Madison Avenue toward the end of the year,
according to people familiar with the plan. The facility will be
E-Trade's first storefront location, a big departure for a company
that has been computer-based from day one.
</P>
<P>
   The move doesn't mean Menlo Park's E-Trade is about to open a
nationwide chain of offices, like rival Charles Schwab Corp., which
operates more than 300 branches to complement its online service.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, E-Trade seeks to create a big marketing splash with a
glitzy office in one of the country's most visible locations. The
site will be akin to electronic gizmomaker Sony's store in San
Francisco's Metreon theater complex or shoemaker Nike's flashy
NikeTown shops.
</P>
<P>
   While customers could presumably open accounts and perform other
business, the site's main purpose is marketing. The store will use
a contemporary, high-tech format to spread E-Trade's image to a
wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is anything but a branch strategy,'' said one person
close to E-Trade. ``This creates a concept store that presents the
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade views its New York store as an experiment. If it creates
a buzz, then the company might open a few stores in other
high-profile locations, people familiar with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News reported last week that E-Trade had leased 30,000
square feet of space at Madison and 55th Street, in the middle of
Manhattan's most fashionable shopping district. E-Trade declined to
provide details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at doing something, but we've confirmed
nothing,'' said spokesman Patrick DiChiro.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a New York store begs the question of whether E-Trade
will eventually be forced to put together a real branch network,
something many analysts say is unavoidable. A broker that just
offers electronic service will serve only a niche market, they
contend, while the mass of customers moves move  &LR; to firms that
offer multiple channels for doing business, including branches,
telephones and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At Schwab, for example, branches and the Internet _ bricks and
clicks _ reinforce each other. one another.  &LR; The firm draws most
deposits through its offices, but customers carry out more than
two-thirds of all trades online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have aspirations to be Wall Street to Main Street,'' a
physical presence is a necessity, said James Punishill, an
electronic commerce analyst at Forrester Research in Massachusetts.
``Ninety percent of Americans aren't interested in a one-trick
pony.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade executives have debated adding brick-and-mortar offices
at length, insiders say. Officials understand that customers want
options in transacting business. But they worry that branches could
dilute E-Trade's Internet business focus and push costs through the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   At an investor conference last year, chief executive Christos
Cotsakos said E-Trade might add physical locations of some kind,
perhaps by buying another business. But in an interview last month,
E-Trade's chief stressed that assembling a traditional branch
network is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be offering some kind of blended model,'' Cotsakos
said. ``But we are not going to build a whole network of costly
physical infrastructure. That's a dinosaur, a prescription for
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade could extend its reach by opening relatively inexpensive
electronic facilities, such as computerized kiosks or ATM-type
machines, Cotsakos noted.  &QL;

 _ SF CHRON   &HT;     Taxing Dividends Of DaimlerChrysler  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I was a longtime owner of Chrysler stock. Since the merger with
Daimler-Benz, I have held stock in DaimlerChrysler. My dividends
from DaimlerChrysler have been subject to a large deduction
described as ``foreign tax.'' Is there any way for me to get my
money back, or must I pay taxes to the German government from now
on?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Welcome to the global economy!
</P>
<P>
   You can get some _ and perhaps all _ of your money back, but in
any case, the German government is legally entitled to a piece of
the action.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works, according to Tim Krause of the
DaimlerChrysler investor relations department:
</P>
<P>
   The dividends paid to shareholders of DaimlerChrysler, a German
corporation, are subject to a 26.375 percent withholding tax by the
German government. However, the German government will refund most
of that _ 16.375 percent of the dividend _ if you submit proof that
you are a U.S. citizen. The Germans are required to make the refund
under a tax treaty with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's U.S. transfer agent, the Bank of New York, is
responsible for sending shareholder claims for refunds to the
German government. Krause says that if your stock is held by your
broker, the Bank of New York would have done this automatically,
and you should have received your refund by now.
</P>
<P>
   So I assume that you own the stock directly. In that case, try
calling the Bank of New York at (800) 470-7410, and someone there
will cut the red tape for you.
</P>
<P>
   The German government is entitled to keep the remaining 10
percent of your dividend. But you probably can get some or all of
that amount back indirectly, in the form of a tax credit, when you
file your U.S. income-tax form. The credit can be used to offset a
like amount of tax.
</P>
<P>
   You may not be able to claim the full amount as a credit if you
are subject to the alternative minimum tax, or for various other,
esoteric reasons, cautions Cynthia Leachmoore, an enrolled tax
agent in Soquel (Santa Cruz County).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this whole subject is so convoluted that you had better
do some serious homework. Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse
Weller suggests that you carefully study the instructions for the
complicated IRS Form 6251, headed ``Alternative Minimum Tax _
Individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   You also should look at the even more complicated Form 1116, and
its instructions. Some taxpayers _ but not all _ must fill out that
form to claim the foreign tax credit. Others can simply enter the
credit directly onto Form 1040.
</P>
<P>
   It might also help to get a copy of Publication 514, ``Foreign
Tax Credit for Individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   You can download forms and publications from the IRS Web site at
www.irs.gov, or get them mailed to you by calling (800) 829-3676.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Finding Historical Prices
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I would like to do research into the historical prices of
certain stocks and mutual funds. I am looking for a Web site that
provides the closing prices going back many years. Can you tell me
where to find this data without having to pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I would look no further than the Yahoo Web site _ assuming
that it is up and running. When it isn't disabled, as it was
yesterday, it is a marvelous tool for the research you have in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Go to finance.yahoo.com/ and enter the symbol for the security
you are researching, then press the tab that says ``Get quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   That will lead you to a new page where you will see the
security's latest price. Click on the link that says ``Charts.''
That will send you to yet another page where you click on the link
for ``Daily'' under the heading ``Table.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you will find yourself on a page where you can set the
chronological parameters of your search _ the beginning and ending
dates. Do that, then click the tab that says ``Get historical
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Voila! You will find a table showing the security's opening,
high, low and closing prices for each date in your search range, as
well as the volume of shares traded.
</P>
<P>
   I tested this procedure myself, picking a stock at random _
Albertson's, the grocery chain. I was able to retrieve daily prices
for this stock going back to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo offers a useful bonus near the bottom of the page where
the stock tables begin _ a link that lets you automatically load
all the information onto a spreadsheet, making it easier to slice
and dice the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Escrow Accounts
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: When do California title companies pay interest on escrow
accounts and when do they not? We were in escrow for $10,000 for 22
months and finally the deal fell through. I visited the title
company to ask about the interest and was told that the money was
not put into an interest-bearing account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Mark Bogetich, a spokesman for the California Land Title
Association, a Sacramento trade group, says that in residential
real-estate transactions, escrow money is almost never placed in an
interest-bearing account. Instead, it is pooled with other escrow
money in a bank account that pays no interest.
</P>
<P>
   He explains that in most cases, the money will remain in escrow
for no more than a few weeks. Whatever interest you might collect
from a segregated, interest-bearing account would be consumed by
the fees you would have to pay the bank, the title company, or
both, to set up the account.
</P>
<P>
   If you had known in advance that the escrow period would be
long, you could have requested a segregated account. If you agreed
to pay the set-up fee, the title company probably would have
complied.
</P>
<P>

 Taxpayers Get Break With Free E-Filing  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It normally costs $19.90 to prepare and file your federal and state
tax returns over the Internet, using Intuit's popular Quicken
TurboTax software.
<P>
   But during the current tax season, the service is being offered
free on selected financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with annual incomes of $20,000 or less, as well as
those eligible to file the simplified Form 1040EZ, can
automatically file for free, courtesy of Intuit. Just go to the Web
site at www.turbotax.com.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers who don't fit those categories can still file for
free, using Quicken, by taking advantage of special promotions
offered by a handful of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Vanguard (www.vanguard.com), Fidelity Investments
(www.fidelity.com), E-Trade (www.etrade.com), American Express
(www.american express.com) and WingspanBank (www.wingspanbank.com).
</P>
<P>
   Log on to those sites, then follow the link to the Quicken site.
There, you can fill out your forms and send them along directly to
the Internal Revenue Service, and the financial institution you
choose will foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   There are some complications, however.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, WingspanBank and American Express are restricting the
offer to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   In E-Trade's case, the service will be free to new customers who
open an individual retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   At WingspanBank, both new and current customers will get the
service free.
</P>
<P>
   At American Express, the service is available to new customers
who open a money-market or checking account with an initial deposit
of at least $500 by March 8.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a customer to use the Quicken software
through the Vanguard and Fidelity Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But if you aren't, you first must register on their sites,
identifying yourself by name and answering questions about, for
example, your Social Security number, your e-mail address, your
home address and your mother's maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity warns that Intuit will send Fidelity some of the
personal information you enter on the Quicken site. However, it
promises that this won't include any details from your tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you do register, you can expect to be badgered soon
afterward with junk mail or telemarketing pitches.
</P>
<P>
   You have to decide for yourself whether enduring that nuisance
is worth the money you will save.
</P>
<P>
   You also can prepare and file your taxes for free over the
Internet, using the Web site of H.D. Vest, a Texas
financial-services company. H.D. Vest has created an interface for
software provided by Tax Works of Utah. Go to the H.D. Vest site at
www.hdvest.com and follow the prompts. You don't have to be a
customer of H.D. Vest, or anyone else, to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   However, you might want to skip it if you are shy about your
age. In addition to the usual information about your home address
and e-mail address, you are required to state your date of birth.

A FORMER GOVERNOR ADMITS TO GRAFT AND IMPLICATES OTHERS IN MEXICO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mexico, Brazil, Cuba, Guatemala)  By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A former governor who fled underground to avoid
arrest on drug charges as his term ended last year, is ``living
like a guerrilla'' in a tropical region, sleeping by day and often
moving by night, a journalist who met him recently said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Mario Villanueva Madrid, has grown his
curly hair long and looks haggard, partly because he sleeps
frequently in the open air, the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hiding like an animal in the jungle,'' said the writer,
Isabel Arvide, an independent journalistwith broad contacts in the
governing party. She met him in a rustic dwelling infested with
cockroaches in southern Mexico or in Belize or Guatemala, the two
countries to the south, Arvide said. She refused to pinpoint the
exact location.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva wept openly as he described to Arvide the trauma of
his 11-month flight and his feelings of betrayal by President
Ernesto Zedillo and other leaders of Mexico's governing party, she
wrote in an account of her meeting that was published on Sunday in
a weekly newsmagazine, Milenio.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor accused his colleagues in the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party of breaking pledges to protect
him. He said he had honored their requests to abuse his powers as
governor of Quintana Roo, a Caribbean state, to guarantee election
victories for the party candidates there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my part,'' Villanueva said, according to Arvide's
account. ``I made all the party's candidates win. I gave them
money. I ran campaigns for them. I controlled the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva has been sought on drug and racketeering charges
since April 1999, when he dropped from sight days before he was to
leave office. Mexican and U.S. authorities have accused him of
putting his state police at the disposition of traffickers who use
the Yucatan Peninsula as a beachhead to smuggle Colombian cocaine
north to the Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva confessed to Arvide that during his governorship,
starting in 1993, he had pocketed millions of dollars in corruption
profits, but denied he had been involved with traffickers. He
accused several senior Mexican officials of having joined in the
graft with him.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva said he had pocketed $1.6 million in kickbacks for
enabling a business group obtain the water concession for Cancun,
the resort city. The illicit deal was negotiated, Villanueva said,
by a former PRI governor who is in Zedillo's cabinet, Eduardo
Robledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait just a minute,'' Robledo said Monday, when a reporter
asked him to respond to Villanueva's assertions. Then Robledo
turned and disappeared into a government office building. A
spokeswoman for him, Virginia Bello, returned to say Robledo
preferred not to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva was reported to have said that as prosecutors were
assembling their charges against him in the months before he left
office, he met a PRI patriarch, Carlos Hank Gonzalez, who amassed a
fortune when he was Mexico City mayor in the 1970s'.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the advice Hank gave me before I fled, I sold
everything I could, collecting money, because he warned me, `To go
underground you'll need cash, lots of cash.''' Villanueva told
Arvide.
</P>
<P>
   Hank's secretary, Yolando Morales, said Monday that Hank was
traveling in the United States. ``I'm sure he's not seen Mario
Villanueva for a long time,'' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his financial descent, Villanueva complained that an
unscrupulous lawyer tied to the PRI had cheated him out of more
than $5 million.

IN A FIRST, A SPACECRAFT IS ORBITING AN ASTEROID 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LAUREL, Md. _ With a nudge from its small rockets, the
spacecraft NEAR gently embraced the asteroid Eros on Monday to
become the first artificial satellite to orbit an asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   The robot spacecraft, called NEAR for Near Earth Asteroid
Rendezvous, fired its thrusters for less than a minute to slow it
enough to be captured by the weak gravity of the asteroid, a
potato-shaped rock roughly twice the size of Manhattan. Because the
computer-controlled maneuver took place 160 million miles from
Earth, it took 20 minutes for news of its success to reach the
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory here, which
built the craft and controls the mission.
</P>
<P>
   With confirmation of the orbit, happy scientists and engineers
gave thumbs-up signs and slapped hands to celebrate their space
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're orbiting around Eros,'' said Dr. Robert W. Farquhar, the
mission director, ``This is an historic day, a real milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew F. Cheng, the project scientist, said NEAR's success
was more than a Valentine's Day gift. The spacecraft will orbit
Eros for a year, slowing moving closer to the surface to make ever
more precise measurements, and greatly increase the understanding
of what scientists believe are remnants of the formation of the
solar system some four billion years ago, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today may be Valentine's Day for most people, but it's
Christmas Eve for me,'' Cheng said, ``And all the presents are
piled about, waiting to be opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Goldin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, which sponsored the $224 million mission,
praised the Johns Hopkins team for persevering. The spacecraft took
a circuitous four-year journey through the inner solar system,
which included a swing by Earth for a gravity boost and a failed
effort to link up with Eros last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough stuff,'' Goldin said after NEAR went into orbit.
``This is very hard work, and they've done a terrific job. But they
still have a long way to go to declare mission success.''
</P>
<P>
   NEAR, loaded with six instruments to determine the mass,
density, chemical composition and other characteristics of an
asteroid, was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Feb. 17, 1996.
Its target was 433 Eros, a large, rocky body named for the Greek
god of love.
</P>
<P>
   After circling back by Earth in January 1997, NEAR flew within
750 miles of another asteroid, Mathilde, in June 1997, to take
measurements and 500 distant photographs. Unlike rocky Eros,
Mathilde is a less dense aggregation of dust and materials rather
than a solid piece.
</P>
<P>
   Eros is called a near-Earth asteroid because its orbit crosses
that of Earth and poses a potential collision danger. The elongated
asteroid, measuring about 21 miles by 9 miles by 8 miles, came
within 14 million miles of Earth in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carl Pilcher, of NASA's Office of Space Science, said it was
important to study different types of asteroids not only out of
scientific curiosity but in self-defense. People may one day have
to defend Earth against a deadly asteroid that could collide with
the planet and destroy all life, he said. Such an asteroid is
believed to have hit Earth 65 million years ago, setting off a
chain of events that wiped out the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the physical characteristics of asteroids will
be very important if we are ever called on to deflect one coming at
the Earth,'' Pilcher said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   NEAR was supposed to go into orbit around Eros last January, but
its main engine misfired several weeks before, plunging the craft
into a comatose ``safe'' mode while controllers tried to figure out
the problem. NEAR missed its chance for an orbital maneuver and
flew by Eros at a distance of 2,500 miles. But the spacecraft's
controllers positioned the craft to chase Eros around the sun for a
year to get another chance, which proved successful.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Veverka of Cornell University, head of the project's
imaging team, said NEAR took its first major scientific reading the
night before going into orbit. Using its infrared spectrometer, an
instrument that tells chemical composition by analyzing light
reflected from an object, the spacecraft took advantage of the
sun's ideal position to map an entire face of the asteroid. ``We're
some very happy, very excited people,'' Veverka said.
</P>
<P>
   Farquhar said that after scientists learned more about Eros'
mass and orientation, they would slowly lower the spacecraft's
orbit from about 300 miles down to about 30 miles in the next two
months. Then the craft will climb back to 300 miles to compile
images of the asteroid's entire surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the mission is at its end next year, the scientists want
NASA to consider allowing the craft to brush the asteroid's surface
with one of its solar panels and then rise to photograph the
resulting mark before crashing on the rocky body.

BRADLEY DECRIES GORE USE OF `SCARE TACTICS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Flashing his first burst of real anger in the
presidential campaign, Bill Bradley Monday accused Vice President
Al Gore of ``shamelessly'' stooping to ``the worst use of scare
tactics I have seen in many years'' to try to turn the homosexual
community against him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has been criticized for failing to fight harder in
his increasingly bitter struggle with Gore, let loose his rage
after awakening to a front-page story in the San Francisco
Chronicle in which Gore said Bradley's health plan ``would
devastate tens of thousands of people with long-term debilitating
diseases such as AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's claim was the latest in a series of blistering attacks on
Bradley and came two days after the vice president blasted Bradley
as a ``Demo-pessimist'' for criticizing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has maintained a trademark reserve throughout his
sports and political careers, turned red with anger as he described
how the news story had ``made my blood boil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the comments made by the vice president outrageous,''
Bradley said in a news conference, flanked by gay activists. ``I
find them to be a use of scare tactics that he should be ashamed
of, and I would think any fair person would believe the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore asserted that Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid coverage
for the poor with federally subsidized private insurance would
compromise health care for the 50 percent of AIDS patients who are
covered by Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley contended that his plan would improve care for patients
with HIV and AIDS in part because it would prohibit insurers from
denying coverage based on preexisting conditions and would provide
broader coverage through a system of community health centers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in New York Monday, barely acknowledged his
opponent, though his spokesman brushed off Bradley's
counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Senator Bradley cannot refute Al
Gore's challenge that his health care plan does not provide
adequate coverage for those who suffer from HIV,'' said Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane. ``What you're seeing is that Senator
Bradley is beginning to wilt under the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS issue is particuarly volatile in the Bay Area, where
the region's large homosexual community wields great influence at
the polls. But gays and lesbians are considered a core Democratic
constituency across the country, and both candidates have
aggressively sought their support.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's position was defended Monday by Henry J. Aaron, a
health care policy expert at the Brookings Institution, who called
Gore's charges misleading and ``gratuitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore's assertion that HIV-positive people would be denied
full coverage under Bradley's plan, Aaron said, ``it's just not a
legitimate criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sheehy, an AIDS patient and Bradley supporter, called
Gore's comments about Bradley's health plan ``astounding for their
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the vice president to frighten people who are in
precarious and marginal situations, it causes me to ask serious
questions about his character,'' Sheehy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's display of anger overshadowed an environmental speech
he gave minutes earlier in which he touted his legislative record
and described Gore as ``long on promises and short on action.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley unveiled his plan to create ``a 21st-century version of
Noah's Ark'' in which the government would identify rare and
threatened ecosystems on federal land and establish priorities for
restoring and preserving them.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Blackwelder, president and founder of Friends of the
Earth, said Gore ``is good on rhetoric . . . . But in terms of
legislation he has been missing in action and the last eight years
have been a disappointment.'' Blackwelder's group endorsed Bradley
last year.
</P>
<P>
   As they debated health care for people with HIV and AIDS Monday,
both Gore and Bradley took positions clearly in line with most
mainstream gay and lesbian groups. But both candidates have taken
more liberal positions than they held on gay rights early in their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as a Tennessee congressman running for Senate in
1984, Gore opposed a measure outlawing discrimination based on
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pretend to have an understanding of homosexuality that
sustains a discussion of its roots . . . but I do not believe it is
simply an acceptable alternative that society should affirm,'' Gore
told the Nashville Tennessean at the time.
</P>
<P>
   During that race Gore also said he would not take campaign
contributions from gay rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bradley has assailed Gore's less liberal record
on issues like abortion and gun control during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, however, Bradley's views on gay rights have also
shifted since that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support gay rights,'' Bradley said during his first
campaign for US Senate in 1978. And like Gore, Bradley also opposed
a ``gay bill of rights'' in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore underwent gradual changes in attitude in
recent years, their campaigns said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in America have come to learn about the problem of
antigay discrimination and changed their view over the years,''
said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway. ``Policymakers are no
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke said Bradley's views on gays
and lesbians were transformed in the early 1990s, when he was
outspoken about racial discrimination in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time when he was such a vocal person on race he was
approached by people in the gay community who said, `What about
us?' '' Ludecke said. ``He really went through a kind of awakening
at that point that made him realize what it meant to be gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludecke added that Bradley was strongly influenced by ``A Boy's
Own Story,'' Edmund White's 1964 novel about a gay adolescent
growing up in the 1950s.

<P>
   CAMILLA, Ga. _ Attacking under cover of darkness and with little
warning, tornadoes rumbled through southwest Georgia early Monday
morning, killing at least 22 people, injuring more than 100 and
transforming peaceful subdivisions into wastelands of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Because the storms began just before midnight Sunday, many
sleeping residents had no idea of the danger until they heard the
cracking of pine trees and the shattering of window panes. Some did
not even have time to get out of bed and into a closet.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny local hospitals, far more accustomed to treating flu
symptoms than large-scale emergencies, were quickly overwhelmed and
had to dispatch the injured all across south Georgia. Power was
lost at the 24-bed Mitchell County Hospital, which spent much of
the night using an emergency generator.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until dawn broke, more than seven hours after the
storms began, that rescue workers could conduct any systematic
search for the dead and injured. That job continued throughout the
afternoon, carried out by an army of law enforcement officers
equipped with bulldozers and German shepherds.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told stories of a midnight horror. In the minutes
after the tornadoes struck, dazed residents wandered into the
darkness to find that brick houses had disintegrated, mobile homes
had disappeared into the night and forests of pines had snapped
like matchsticks. Doused by heavy rain, many blindly followed the
wails of injured neighbors and then used cellular telephones to
summon emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the help arrived too late. John Ira Williams, a
33-year-old diesel mechanic who lives here, had just pulled into
the driveway of the mobile home he shared with his 51-year-old
mother when the tornado blew through. Sitting in his Camaro,
Williams felt the trailer blow off of its cement-block foundation
and nudge up against his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the trailer just disappeared,'' he said. ``It just
disintegrated. I don't even know where it went. I saw the house
just come apart.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Rubye Lee Williams, had been sleeping inside,
snuggled in bed with her two granddaughters, ages 7 and 2, who were
spending the night. Williams found the older girl, his niece,
scratched and bruised, wandering outside in a dreamlike state,
trying to find her way back inside a house that was no longer
there. The younger girl was asleep in a puddle, apparently unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Using a flashlight from his car, Williams searched for his
mother, eventually finding her some 75 yards from where the trailer
once stood. She was breathing, barely, but by the time a paramedic
arrived 15 minutes later she had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He checked her pulse and said there wasn't anything more he
could do,'' Williams said, as his sister stood by with a salvaged
photograph of their mother in a red dress. ``I just kind of lost
it. I got real numb and couldn't do anything for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths _ 14 as of Monday evening _ were here in
Mitchell County, a rural area of pecan groves, cotton fields and
peanut farms, with a population of 21,000. State officials said
that seven more people died in Grady County, just south of here,
and that one died in Colquitt County, just to the east. Gov. Roy E.
Barnes declared a state of emergency in those counties and Tift
County, which is northeast of Colquitt, and requested federal
disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
   After surveying the damage by helicopter Monday morning, Barnes
said it looked as if one tornado had cut a swath 10 miles long and
1 and a half miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mobile home park on the south side of town and it
just looks like a bomb dropped,'' Barnes said, speaking in Camilla.
``It's just flattened, nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the loss of life Monday ``unusual and
terrible'' and asked for the country's prayers.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear exactly how many tornadoes had formed and how
strong they were. Matthew R. Volkmer, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Fla., said there were at
least two or three tornadoes in the area and five or six
``super-cell thunderstorms.'' Several residents here said they felt
a second, lesser tornado blow through about 20 minutes after the
first one.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross said that initial damage assessments
found that 198 structures, most of them houses, had been destroyed
here in Mitchell County. An additional 81 sustained major damage
and 87 had minor damage. The Red Cross opened a shelter in a middle
school here, and more than 100 people stayed there on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials reported an array of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lots of lacerations, a lot of broken arms, legs,
internal injuries, head injuries, a lot of cut glass,'' said Ronald
M. Gilliard, administrator of the Mitchell County Hospital. Glen C.
Davis, the administrator of Grady General Hospital, in Cairo,
described much of the same, as well as one arm amputation. A
pregnant woman reportedly was injured; her baby was delivered by
Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly some of the worst damage occurred in a mobile home park
on the south side of U.S. Highway 19, just outside the Camilla city
limits. Many trailers were simply obliterated, and the park was
littered with downed trees and piles of nearly unrecognizable
rubble. The ground was tinted pink and black from tufts of
insulation and shards of shingles. Red drapery and silver strips of
sheet metal flapped like flags from the upper limbs of the few
denuded trees that still stood. A tractor trailer sat on its side,
as did countless cars.
</P>
<P>
   Residents scavenged through the sites of their former homes,
tossing keepsakes into piles, baseball trophies over here, photo
albums over there. Many said they would be happy to find enough
clothing to get them through the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Thomas, 42, huddling in a hallway with his wife, said he
could literally hear his manufactured home trying to split in two
as the tornado came through. His car, a red Escort, was lifted and
deposited 50 feet away. ``We started hearing people hollering for
help,'' he said. ``There were a lot of people out and about, just
screaming, trying to get out of the area.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Highway 19, where the Royal Heights
subdivision of brick ranches once stood, roofs had been sheared
away by the wind and downed trees were everywhere. Four smashed
cars were buried beneath pine trees in the McCaskill family's front
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Gail G. Swindle, 60, who has lived in her house for 29 years,
escaped with relatively minor damage to her house but said the
night was horrific nonetheless. ``I got my pocketbook, the cell
phone and the car keys and got in the tub,'' she said. ``It was
terrifying. That's the most helpless feeling, because there's
absolutely nothing you can do. You just have to go with it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most fortunate people here were the Anglin family.
As the storm began, Chris and Cindy Anglin tried to roust their
four children into a single bathroom, but the family was separated
when the tornado hit. Cindy and the two boys hunkered down on one
end of the house, while Chris and the girls were trapped on the
other side. The tornado came straight down the middle, tearing the
roof off, collapsing the brick walls, and somehow leaving the
family with only minor scratches and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been in the middle of the house, we wouldn't be
here,'' Mrs. Anglin said. ``We saw a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   While searching the debris Monday morning, Mrs. Anglin found the
waterlogged Valentine card she had bought for her husband, and gave
it to him. ``I've got one for you,'' he swore. ``I've got proof.
But I don't know where it is.''

CONSULTANT PREDICTS EVEN HIGHER `BIG DIG' PRICETAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The top management consultant overseeing the city's
``Big Dig'' says the project's cost may climb beyond the recently
announced $12.2 billion pricetag before its completion five years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you it's the end,'' said Matthew Wiley, top
official of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, during a 90-minute
discussion Monday of project finances _ including the recent
surprise announcement that the project will grow by $1.4 billion
over projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you something's not going to occur underground
that we don't know about,'' Wiley said, sitting next to Turnpike
Chairman James J. Kerasiotes, the state official responsible for
managing the Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiley added that the $12.2 billion figure is an estimate,
and held out the possibility that project could cost less than
that. ``$10.8 billion is still a number we want to become close
to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The project officials met with reporters Monday to try to assure
the public that the massive highway construction is under control,
despite mounting criticism about the climbing cost.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a federal inspector general's report was made
public. The report accused regional Federal Highway Administration
monitors of becoming too willing to accept state transportation
officials' cost estimates without verification.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the project officials told reporters that they did not
try to hide anything, that until last last year they were hopeful
the cost could be held to $10.8 billion _ and that, in any case, at
the time they did not have a precise estimate of how much the
project could actually cost beyond that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes acknowledged for the first time Monday that in 1993,
when he raised the official cost estimate from $6.4 billion to $7.7
billion to cover the cost of a new Charles River Crossing design,
he built in a ``cushion'' of about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing costs, however, consumed that cushion by early last
year, he said, and dozens of opportunities to cut costs on the
project had been exhausted as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wiley said, ``I think there's opportunity there'' to find
savings in the project, though project officials acknowledged that
the $1.4 billion increase was necessary because by last fall they
had run out of ways to offset increasing construction costs
throughout the highway, tunnel, and bridge megaproject.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerasiotes vowed that the project ``is going to be done on
time'' by the end of 2004. ``I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite cost increases and the inspector general's report, both
Kerasiotes and Wiley insist that management of the eight-year-old
project is under control. Kerasiotes cited the lack of any known
significant corruption, the admirable safety record, and the fact
that traffic in the city has moved relatively well even during
heavy construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project has been managed very well,'' Kerasiotes said.
``I think this project has has superb management by any measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes said the continuous cost increases _ including a
steady rise from an optimistic mid-1980s estimate of $2.6 billion
to today's $12.2 billion figure _ should not come as a big
surprise. ``Anybody who's ever looked at a project like this knows
it's going to cost more . . . It's not that our heads are in the
sand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley was asked if this project was managed as well as the other
projects by Bechtel, the multinational construction consultant.
``I'd like to think it's a lot better managed,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1993, Kerasiotes made a firm statment that the project's
price tag would not go higher than $10.8 billion and he has stuck
to it since then _ sometimes angrily, when challenged. But he
downplayed that stance Monday: ``I haven't been out there selling
the number $10.8 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes said he asked Patrick J. Moynihan to ``do a complete
assessment of the project'' when Moynihan took over as project
director early in 1999. That ``bottom-to-top review,'' Kerasiotes
said, led to the recognition in the fall that there was no way to
stick to the $10.8 billion figure.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he and the financial managers who joined him in the
interview Monday said officials have been trying to pinpoint an
accurate, final estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes said the price tag would have been even higher had it
not been for his aggressive approach: ``We beat the living
daylights out of the number every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected the notion that Peter M. Zuk _ who managed the
project for almost eight years before Moynihan took over _ bore
some responsibility for the $1.4 billion increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's the case at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Reynolds, program and budget manager for the Big Dig,
said that he knew in 1993 that Kerasiotes' vow that the project
would not cost a penny more than $10.8 billion would be difficult
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The statement ``had aggressive assumptions in it'' about
cost-cutting, Reynolds said. ``I was getting somewhat uneasy in the
second and third quarters of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that the project's monthly management reports,
which purport to track the cost and schedule, have not reflected
the $1.4 billion increase because they aren't sure that they will
incur that cost.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports have consistently shown about $500 million in cost
increases beyond the $10.8 billion, though until recently the
increases were offset almost dollar for dollar by project
reductions or other cost-saving maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lewis, deputy project director, was asked why those were
taken more or less conveniently in increments, month by month, as
project costs increased _ rather than all being reflected at once.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes has frequently criticized his predecessors in the
Dukakis administration for ``managing to a number'' _ carrying cost
estimates that were politically palatable but did not reflect what
the project would actually cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think it was prudent to . . . say the project costs
less,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Bechtel's Wiley said he was comfortable with Kerasiotes's
statements that the cost would be $10.8 billion, even when he knew
what number was slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Though the opportunities for savings shrank in the third quarter
of 1999, Wiley said, ``I did not have a problem maintaining the
`$10.8 billion', or statements the chairman was making.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Kerasiotes and the Turnpike have been more
difficult than other clients, Wiley said, ``No. They're probably
very good to deal with. There aren't many . . . organizations we
would go in to work with as a project team, especially in the
public contracting sector.''

   European Union to Back German Official for IMF
</P>
<P>
   The European Union appears set to back a German finance ministry
official to head the International Monetary Fund, giving a boost to
a candidate Clinton administration officials privately argue is
ill-suited for the job. European foreign ministers, meeting in
Brussels, reached an informal consensus that Caio K. Koch-Weser,
55, a longtime World Bank official who currently serves as a state
secretary in Germany's finance ministry, should succeed Michel
Camdessus as head of the fund.

   Maytag Issues an Earnings Warning
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Maytag, the appliance maker, fell sharply after
the company warned that earnings this year would not meet Wall
Street expectations. The company said first quarter earnings could
be down 10 percent from a year ago because of fierce competition in
the market for home appliances and weaker-than-expected sales of
its soft drink vending machines. The warning was the second in
three quarters for Maytag.

   Bargain Hunting Sends Markets Up
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended higher as Wall Street scouted for bargains, notably
among cyclical stocks, after a sharp sell-off last week that sent
the blue-chip Dow index reeling into a correction. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 94.63 points, or 0.9 percent, to
10,519.84, after losing 538.59 points or 4.9 percent last week. The
broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed up 2.82 points, or
0.2 percent, to 1,389.94. The Nasdaq climbed 23.10 points, or 0.52
percent, to 4,418.55.

   ETrade Filings Exclude Some Data
</P>
<P>
   ETrade Group has spent millions of advertising dollars to build
its reputation as a company that empowers individual investors.
Along the way, however, it has been slow to provide investors some
crucial information about itself. On two occasions in recent
months, ETrade has excluded information about its executives' pay
packages from Securities and Exchange Commission filings, an
apparent violation of rules.

   Goldman Official Is Paid $25 Million
</P>
<P>
   Henry Paulson, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs
Group, was one of at least five top executives on Wall Street to
take home more than $25 million last year. He joined three senior
executives at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the chief executive of
Merrill Lynch in receiving 1999 pay packages of more than $25

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I will be in London this spring and would like to travel to
Brussels by train, tour the city and return to London the same day.
Is this possible? And whom should I contact for information? _
Irving Greene, East Brunswick, N.J. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The folks in Brussels would probably tell you that it takes
more than a day to see their city, but if that's all the time you
have, then, yes, it can be done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fastest way to cover the 193 miles between the two cities is
by a Eurostar train, which goes through the Channel Tunnel. The
trip takes about three hours each way.
</P>
<P>
   From London, the earliest departure is 6 a.m. from Waterloo
Station, arriving in Brussels at 10:02 a.m. (remember that England
is one hour behind continental Europe). This train runs Monday
through Saturday under a schedule that is in effect through March
23. A 6:53 a.m. departure, available Monday through Friday, arrives
in Brussels at 10:37 a.m. And a daily departure at 8:13 a.m.
reaches Brussels at 12:10 p.m. There are other departures
throughout the day as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For your return trip, you can catch a 5:56 p.m. Eurostar train
in Brussels and, with the time difference, arrive in London at 7:39
p.m.; this train is available Monday through Saturday. There are
two later departures each day: 6:56 p.m., with arrival in London at
8:56 p.m.; and 9:01 p.m., arriving 10:59 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The standard fare (50 percent refundable up to three days before
the train's departure date) is $119 one way; a food-cart service is
offered, but meals cost extra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The one-way fare is $199 in first class (50 percent refundable
up to three days before departure), which includes a wider seat
than second class, a free newspaper and a meal served at your seat;
first premium class, $329, adds a wider selection of drinks and
food, use of the Executive Lounge in Waterloo Station and a free
taxi ride from the station in London.
</P>
<P>
   The train station in Belgium is Brussels Midi, about 15 minutes'
walk from the center of the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You must reserve your Eurostar ticket in advance. You can book
on the Web at www.raileurope.com, at (800) 456-7245 or through a
travel agent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a limited number of hours in Brussels, you will want to
give yourself a good head start in planning your visit. Contact the
Belgian Tourist Office, 780 Third Avenue, Suite 1501, New York,
N.Y. 10017; (212) 758-8130, www.visitbelgium.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Brussels Tourist Office is in the Town Hall on the
Grand-Place; telephone (32-2) 513-8940, fax (32-2) 514-4538,
www.brussels.org. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be taking an Amtrak See America tour this summer and
would like to know of any pottery stores in New York, Chicago,
Denver, San Francisco and San Diego. I am interested in functional
handmade pottery, not big-name company outlets. _ Vickie Price,
Waldwick, N.J. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you can carry all this pottery, here are some
suggestions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, TriBeCa Potters, 443 Greenwich Street, (212)
431-7631, produces handmade ceramic plates that are favored by
Manhattan restaurateurs looking to dress up their tables with
something beyond the ordinary. Try
hometown.aol.com/nycpotters/tribecapotters.html. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people at TriBeCa, in turn, recommended that you stop at

South Gaylord Street, (303) 744-3421, and the Clay Pigeon, 601
Ogden Street, (303) 832-5538; on the Web at www.claypigeon.com.
Each has been in business for decades, selling the wares of local
artisans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you reach San Francisco, there are a number of places to
look. The Virginia Breier Gallery (also known as the Virginia
Breier Contemporary and Traditional Craft), 3091 Sacramento Street,
has a great selection of pottery made by local artisans. Call (415)
929-7173. Also in the area is the Berkeley Potter's Guild, 731
Jones Street at Fourth Street in Berkeley, not far from the
freeway.
</P>

at that location, which houses their studios and showroom. But they
are open only on Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call
(510) 524-7031. For a more extensive guide to Bay Area pottery
centers, try www.claymedia.com. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in Frankfurt overnight on a layover on my return
from Malta in May, and I wish to attend a performance of the
Frankfurt Ballet. How would I make a reservation from the United
States? _ L.P., Portland, Ore. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

FACTIONS SCUFFLE AS MEXICAN CAMPUS REOPENS 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Scuffles broke out at the national university
Monday as tens of thousands of students returned for the first
official day of classes since a strike started last April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Students flocked peacefully to their classrooms Monday morning,
on the first day when almost all schools and departments were open.
At midmorning about 2,000 supporters of the strike marched into the
campus, saying they hoped to persuade other students to go home.
</P>
<P>
   At the law school, a shouting match between factions turned into
rock-throwing. When pro-strike students tried to enter the
building, other students slammed the gates to keep them out.
</P>
<P>
   After the strike dragged on for more than nine months, federal
police took over the campus on Feb. 6 and arrested 754 strikers.
The police withdrew after three days.
</P>
<P>
   The strike movement declared that the strike is not over and has
continued to meet at other universities in Mexico City. The
strikers said their goal Monday was to persuade students to renew
the strike.
</P>
<P>
   But the only department where strikers managed to occupy the
auditorium was Sciences, which had been a headquarters of the
movement. The department chairman postponed the start of classes,
saying he hoped to avert a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere life on the vast campus returned to normal remarkably
quickly, with students playing soccer on the spacious lawns and
poring over textbooks in the sunshine. Of 275,000 students enrolled
in the National Autonomous University of Mexico when the strike
began, 230,000 at most were expected to return to classes,
administration officials said. Others have dropped out or moved to
other universities.
</P>
<P>
   However, protests from intellectuals and political leaders
against the police intervention have multiplied. On Saturday a
Mexico City judge denied bail to 52 strikers and upheld charges
against two strike leaders, Alejandro Echavarria and Alberto
Pacheco, for felony theft. At least 50 other strikers remain in
jail awaiting formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Velarde, an economics professor who was a chief
strategist of the strike movement, wrote a letter to the newspaper
La Jornada to say he was not detained, as the paper had reported,
but was in hiding in Mexico City.

STUDY REPORTS ON CLEANLINESS OF NATURAL-GAS BUSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Buses powered by compressed natural gas _ long viewed
as the cleanest alternative to diesel buses _ are no better for the
environment than buses powered by a combination of diesel and
electricity, according to a study that could have broad
implications for vehicle fleets across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal transportation agencies around the country have come
under pressure to switch to natural-gas buses as a way to reduce
pollution, with Los Angeles and other cities converting their whole
fleets to this technology. But New York City, which has enormous
influence on the bus market because of the size of its purchases,
has resisted, citing huge costs.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by a group that analyzes vehicle pollution for the
federal government, is likely to shift the bus debate at a time
when all the leading automakers are pushing ahead with the
development of electric-and-fuel hybrid cars and light-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our opinion, this confirms what we've been saying about the
hybrid electric technology,'' said Lawrence G. Reuter, president of
New York City Transit, which runs a fleet of 4,300 buses, the
largest in the country, 90 of them powered by natural gas and six
now being tested with hybrid electric engines.
</P>
<P>
   Reuter added: ``You will see us moving faster into the hybrid
technology field.''
</P>
<P>
   Diesel fuel produces more potentially hazardous pollution, known
as particulate matter, than natural gas. But the study found that
some diesel-electric hybrid engines were built in a way that made
the release of such pollution no greater than that given off by
natural-gas engines.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmental advocates who have pushed for natural-gas
buses immediately criticized the study, saying that while it might
show that natural-gas and hybrid buses can produce comparably low
levels of the particulate matter, it did not analyze the toxic
qualities of those tiny particles.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientific evidence suggests that tiny diesel particles,
unlike those from natural-gas engines, can worsen asthma. The
diesel particles have also been listed as a possible carcinogen by
the California Air Resources Board, though other groups have
disputed this finding. ``It's impossible for us to accept the
notion of a clean diesel without knowing the toxicity,'' said
Richard Kassel, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over cleaner buses has played out over the last
decade, New York has been the only city in the nation to put a
significant amount of money into hybrid diesel technology for its
bus fleet.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the reason is that while natural-gas buses are
now cheaper to buy than hybrid buses, it can cost anywhere from $25
million to $40 million to convert a city bus depot so that it can
refuel and service natural-gas buses safely.
</P>
<P>
   Six hybrid buses _ propelled by electric motors that draw their
current from a small diesel engine on board _ are being tested by
the city, which has ordered 125 more.
</P>
<P>
   The only other cities expressing an interest in the hybrid buses
are Tempe, Ariz., and Boston, said Sheila Lynch, the executive
director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, the
nonprofit agency that oversaw the bus tests.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 municipal bus agencies _ including those in Atlanta;
Los Angeles; Sacramento, Calif.; Cleveland; and the New York
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Long Island fleet _ are now
buying only compressed natural-gas buses.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynch said that if the study prompted New York City to move
faster into testing and buying hybrid buses, other cities could
follow suit and push down the costs of producing them. A hybrid bus
costs about $385,000 and a natural-gas bus is about $325,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bus tests, conducted over the spring and fall of last year
in Boston and Brooklyn, found that diesel-hybrid buses equipped
with pollution-exhaust traps and using special low-sulfur fuel
produced so little particle pollution that it could not be detected
by engineers' machines.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid buses, however, produced more nitrogen oxide, which
contributes to ground-level ozone. The natural-gas buses also
produced too little particle pollution to be detected, though they
produced more carbon dioxide, a significant greenhouse gas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Balon, a senior project manager for M.J. Bradley, an
environmental consulting company that performed the tests, said
that the particles produced by both the natural-gas bus and the
hybrid bus would add up to probably less than a pound a year per
bus, compared with as much as 42 pounds per year from a traditional
diesel bus.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of natural-gas buses said they considered the study to
be further flawed because the hybrid buses being tested on New York
City streets do not use the low-sulfur fuel that was used in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the low-sulfur fuel was not widely available in
the United States. But Reuter, the New York City Transit president,
said that the agency has begun testing the low-sulfur fuel and that
if the tests proved successful, the city would try to persuade fuel
companies to produce and sell it.

   MCCAIN-STYLE (Columbia, S.C.) _ John McCain often says he wants
to imitate his hero Ronald Reagan and broaden his party's appeal,
but it is one of those odd twists of politics that he is trying to
do this by running against the controlled, high-gloss techniques
that Reagan brought to presidential campaigns. For McCain is still
brandishing as his main campaign weapon his relentless
accessibility. Much of this openness is a way to get free publicity
to counter the financial advantage of his main competitor, Gov.
George W. Bush. But more and more, McCain drops suggestions that
this campaign style is about something broader. A political memo by

GOLDMAN SACHS PROXY SHOWS CHIEF MADE OVER $25 MILLION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry M. Paulson, the chairman and chief executive of
the Goldman Sachs Group, was one of at least five top executives on
Wall Street to take home more than $25 million last year, according
to the firm's first proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson received $16.6 million in salary and bonus plus
restricted stock worth another $8.8 million, the proxy shows. He
joined three senior executives at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter _
Peter Karches, John J. Mack and Philip J. Purcell _ and the chief
executive of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., David H. Komansky, who received
1999 pay packages of more than $25 million, according to proxy
statements those firms filed last week with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Each received more compensation than the top executives of Bear
Stearns Cos., which for years has had the highest-paid management
team on Wall Street. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, Bear
Stearns paid its chief executive, James Cayne, $23.2 million in
cash, stock and other compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the raise Paulson received is difficult to measure
because Goldman was a private partnership before it went public in
May. For Goldman partners, the annual growth of their stakes in the
firm was a significant component of their compensation. Excluding
that sum, Paulson received about $12.7 million in total
compensation in fiscal 1998, when he was running the firm along
with Jon S. Corzine, who was pushed to resign last year and is a
Democratic candidate in New Jersey for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most competitors, Goldman Sachs did not give stock
options to any employees last year. It does allow its managers to
invest in funds that Goldman manages. Paulson took distributions of
more than $5 million on his investments in those funds last year,
the proxy shows.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Thain and John L. Thornton, who share the titles of
president and chief operating officer for Goldman, each took home
more than $21 million in cash and stock for the period from May 7
through November. Robert J. Hurst, a vice chairman, received more
than $19 million.

<P>
   CAMILLA, Ga. _ Georgia's fifth deadliest cluster of tornadoes
ripped apart South Georgia families and communities as cruelly and
as randomly as it did the tattered valentines found strewn among
ruined homes, barns and collard fields.
</P>
<P>
   The series of rare winter tornadoes savaged the counties of
Mitchell, Grady, Tift and Colquitt before dawn Monday, killing at
least 22 people, injuring 100 and destroying about 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   No tornadoes to hit Georgia since World War II have been as
deadly.
</P>
<P>
   They tore a half-mile wide, 10-mile long swath of destruction
through Mitchell County, 30 miles from the Florida border,
obliterating trailers and houses, snapping old-growth oak and pine
trees, scattering cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell County was hit hardest with 14 reported deaths. The
injured included a 4-year-old boy found in the rubble of his
family's house trailer in Camilla late Monday afternoon. His
6-year-old sister died in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the devastation so thorough as in the mobile home
park just south of Camilla off U.S. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Where once stood 100 trailers, three remained. Survivors said
they had little, if any, time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just woke up,'' Earnest Thompson said Monday as he and
his companion, Katherine Sharp, picked through the rubble of his
mobile home. ``I got up and cut the TV on, and it hit _ just that
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple was thrown into a muddy, debris-filled front lawn as
their trailer exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was holding on to me,'' Thompson said, ``and I held her
down until it blew through. ... We're just glad to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven people died in Grady County, and one person in
Colquitt County.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency for the four
counties before touring devastated sections of Mitchell County by
helicopter. He requested federal disaster relief upon returning
from his flyover of the obliterated mobile home park below Camilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like somebody dropped a bomb on it,'' Barnes said.
``It's a bad hit. It's a swath _ wide and long.''
</P>
<P>
   To local officials, the governor added, ``Whatever y'all need,
we're going to send you. It's that simple. Whatever we need to do,
we'll do it. We'll make sure this tragedy is not worse than it
already is.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials will make mobile homes available by Thursday for
victims left homeless by the storm, said Gary McConnell, director
of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. The state also
dispatched law enforcement officers and electricity generators to
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a long haul,'' McConnell told Mitchell
County officials.
</P>
<P>
   The county sheriff, W.E. Bozeman, remarked, ``Right now, we're
just trying to make it to tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gilliard, Mitchell County Hospital administrator, said the
33-bed facility quickly became ``a war zone,'' with more than 120
injured people pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallway was lined with patients. We took mattresses off
older beds and put them on the floor. We had patients in chairs, on
cots,'' he said. ``My entire medical staff responded, including
off-duty people, and a lot of our folks have damaged homes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the death toll was high because so few people
knew the tornadoes were coming. It was after 11 p.m., and many
apparently didn't hear the broadcast warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some warning, but everybody was asleep,'' Barnes
said. ``There was just not enough time for them to know. While
there was some warning, I would doubt there was very little
knowledge of the warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Most tornadoes to hit Georgia strike in March, April or May, not
mid-February. Most occur in the late afternoon or early evening
hours, once the day's heat sufficiently builds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Monday's twisters were also eerily familiar. Mobile homes
and their dwellers were hit hardest. The survivors spoke of roaring
winds, sideways rain and of fear never before known.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tift County town of Omega, Jason and Robin Cone ran from
bedroom to bathroom, remembering that a bathtub is supposed to
offer safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the window exploded, we ran back to the bed,'' Robin
Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   The winds lifted their home from its moorings before flinging it
back to the ground with a fury, splintering and shattering almost
everything. Remarkably, the bedroom was the only room that remained
intact.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 56 years since tornados claimed so many lives in
Georgia. On April 16,1944, in Gainesville, 41 people were killed by
twisters.
</P>
<P>
   Gainesville holds the dubious record of the state's most deadly
tornado site: Twisters in 1936 killed 203; tornados in 1908 killed
98. The Statesboro area registered 52 deaths in 1929. On February
10, 1940, in Albany, 22 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 13 people died when storms struck Hall and White
counties. Less than a month later, one person died in the Dunwoody
tornadoes in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While South Georgia bore the brunt of the new century's first
tornadoes, North Georgia and much of the Southeast didn't escape
unscathed. Hail _ 1.75 inches thick _ pelted McDonough in Henry
County. Cedartown in Polk County and Cumming in Forsyth County
received inch-sized hail.
</P>
<P>
   Bursts of torrential rain and gusty wind swept across metro
Atlanta, causing little more than traffic tie-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama and
Tennessee reported wind damage but no fatalities from the storms,
which hit them Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, a twister in southern Montgomery County flung pieces
of a factory's four metal buildings nearly 2 miles and caused
$400,000 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida Panhandle just north of Panama City, tornadoes
were blamed for damage to at least 40 homes. In Arkansas, a twister
just east of Little Rock destroyed at least six homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Georgia, though, where the nation's eyes focused Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very saddened by the terrible loss of life and the other
damage,'' President Clinton said at the White House during an
Hispanic American Achievement ceremony. ``The loss of life in
Georgia this morning is unusual, and terrible. And I ask for your
prayers for those people today.''
</P>
<P>
   No community suffered like the sprawling trailer park just south
of Camilla.
</P>
<P>
   Residents described the coummunity as a friendly place where
children played and neighbors helped each other. On Monday, most of
their homes were twisted into pieces of metal that were wrapped
around trees, scattered across a nearby pecan grove or impaled on
tree limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the deaths and injuries in Mitchell County were
in the trailer park, said Robbie Hopkins, a county emergency
medical services official.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Monday, rescuers combed the trailer park _ some using
specially trained dogs, some operating heavy fork lifts, others
using their hands to scrounge through rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Rare good news came when searchers found the 4-year-old boy who
had been missing. He was hospitalized, but details of his condition
were not available late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His home was across the street from a large field where at least
a dozen homes had stood. On Monday, a tractor-trailer sat on its
side nearby. Car windows had been blown out.
</P>
<P>
   An eclectic array of litter covered the soggy ground: stovetops
from electric ranges, videocassette recorders, cordless telephones,
unpaid bills and loose snapshots _ the remains of the lives the
tornadoes ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   The park's residents gathered at the piles of debris that had
once been their homes, looking for anything worth saving and
talking about the horror they had lived through.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the demolished trailer of his neighbor Freddy
Williams, Ricky Sessions was hailed as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   His own home suffered little damage. But after the storm passed,
he said, ``I heard somebody calling, 'Help, help!'''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions ran outside, where rain still pounded and a strong wind
howled. Rubble was everywhere _ as were downed power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started going door to door to see if everybody's OK,''
Sessions said. ``I just kept hollering, I just kept hollering, I
just kept hollering. Then I heard him say, 'Here I go! Here I
go!'''
</P>
<P>
   It was Williams. The 43-year-old man had been blown across the
street, 50 feet away. He tried to stand, but couldn't because of
injuries to his back and head.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions found a police officer and helped load the injured man
into the cruiser that would take him to the hospital. Williams was
in critical condition Monday afternoon, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so lucky. Laritta Jackson and Joyce Williams
walked through the trailer park Monday looking for friends from
church who were missing. Williams' cousin and her cousin's two
teenage children died in the tornado, she said, and her aunt was in
the hospital, paralyzed from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the trailer park's residents spent Monday seeing what
they could salvage before they left for shelters or the homes of
friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just homeless,'' said Katherine Sharp, who had
lived in the trailer with Earnest Thompson for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No clothes, no nothing,'' Thompson said, assessing their
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Their trailer was shoved 20 feet off its foundation, and one
wall was ripped away. Everything inside seemed to have been sucked
out and scattered. Sifting through the rubble, Sharp found her
purse. But she said, ``I wish I could find my wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson answered, ``That wallet's gone, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything was gone, and Thompson said his hip, chest and
shoulders hurt from being pummeled by flying debris. It could've
been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord was just with us, man,'' he said. ``Yep, the
good Lord was just with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The destruction was no less devastating to families in the Omega
community.
</P>
<P>
   Shredded pink insulation and torn Valentines were all that
remained of several homes along the Tift-Colquitt county line.
Nearby, homes, barns, and crops were leveled. The Dunn family
mourned the death of their friend Guadalupe Cervantes, 43, who was
killed when a pecan tree crushed her inside her mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two hours to find her, with friends families and EMS
workers digging through the crushed trailer,'' said her brother,
Antonio Cervantes.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado blew another mobile home on top of her crushed
trailer, said Kenny Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was total devestation when we got there around 2 a.m.,''
said Dunn. ``Lupe, as she is known ... , will be missed and mourned
for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down Omega-Eldorado Road, the damage was severe. Dorothy
Hall was found cut and bruised in her yard after the tornado
leveled her house. Nearby, a car was flattened under a pecan tree
and a tractor was overturned in a collard field.
</P>
<P>
   Junior and Betty Keith also survived the twister in their bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Tift County couple didn't know the tornado was aimed at them
``until the house started breaking apart and coming down,'' said
Betty Keith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the boom when the skylight exploded and everything
was sucked out around us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Dunn, whose home was unharmed, said numerous farm families
in this community are suffering a double blow from the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming hasn't been all that great in the past few years, what
with the severe drought of the past summer,'' he said. ``Now, folks
have lost everything _ farm vehicles, trucks, cars, and homes are
all totally demolished. I hope we can get some federal aid down
here.''

said the capital of the embattled province of Chechnya had become
too dangerous for its inhabitants. It will be off-limits for two
weeks while Interior Ministry troops comb the city for weapons,
unexploded bombs and booby-traps.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers conceded that the move was also a precaution
against rebel infiltration. Leaflets circulated throught the city
Monday warning residents that militants were planning a new
guerrilla campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement to Grozny will be restricted until March 1,'' Zaitsev
said, waving an order from the high command. ``Those civilians who
are already in the city will be gradually evacuated. There are
refugee camps, and if someone does not have permanent residence we
will send him there. We will provide transportation for those that
cannot walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were also instructed to turn back any civilians trying
to return to Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how the Russian troops intended to
empty the city, especially since many of the residents who only
recently had emerged from their basement shelters after weeks of
bombardment and terror said they had no intention of abandoning
what little they had.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they simply had no place to move to, and little desire
to end up in an overcrowded refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not leaving,'' said Tamara N. Zheromyskaya, 57, a
veterinarian. She said she was not well enough to travel and wanted
to stay with her son. Beyond that, she added, ``I have nowhere to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   To anyone but the stubborn residents hanging on, Grozny seemed
beyond restoration. Demolition teams moved through the city blowing
up the half-destroyed shell of buildings. Huge explosions rocked
the city, sending dust billowing into the sky. With each explosion,
Grozny seems to sink further into the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Looting has been a serious problem. The first complement of
pro-Russian Chechen police officers arrived Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aid convoys have begun to snake through the city, but
food and water are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of civilians _ no one knew how many _ who
braved the war seem determined to endure the peace. They do not
have much: a one-room apartment, perhaps some furniture. But they
were determined to hold onto the little they have, despite the
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   And there were plenty. Zaitsev said, for example, that Russian
soldiers had found 11,000 explosive devices in the last few weeks.
Some are booby traps laid by the departing rebels, he said. Others
are unexploded ordnance, like the 500-pound Russian bomb that was
found across in the Zavodskoi district.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fear of renewed fighting is another concern. After the fall of
Grozny, most of the fighting shifted to the south. The Russian
troops blazed a path of destruction as they chased the remnants of
the rebel force in Grozny through towns like Katyr-Yurt and
Shaami-Yurt. Trying to regain the initiative, the rebels briefly
took the town of Gekhi-Chu. After they left, Russian artillery
pounded the settlement, causing numerous civilian casualties,
according to Russian media reports from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets distributed in Grozny on Monday warned that the
militants might strike on Feb. 23, the anniversary of Stalin's
attempt to deport the Chechen people to Kazakhstan. Stalin's move
was eventually reversed by Nikita Khrushchev, but not before it
fanned the rancor between the Russians and many Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets read: ``The commanders of the illegal armed
formations want to draw your towns, settlements and streets into
the chaos of war and violence. Stay quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Akhmed Khizriyev, a 47-year-old construction engineer, and Asya,
his wife, fled during the war but returned to Grozny on Monday to
try to retrieve some of their belongings. They were surprised when
soldiers told them the checkpoints around the city were being
closed, and they were told the closing was ordered to prevent the
militants from infiltrating and carrying out partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of Russian forces in
the North Caucasus, drove the point home Monday in an appearance
before Russian television reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandits are sneaking through disguised as civilians in order
to take out their wounded who are still here and to strengthen
their positions in Grozny,'' Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered through several wars, however, Grozny residents
seem more concerned about the Russian evacuation plan than the
possibility of more fighting. They do not want to part with what is
left of their home or end up in a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Klavdiya M. Nefyodova, 88, summed up the prevailing mood: ``I do
not want to leave my belongings here.''

for which data are available, died at the hands of a husband, a
former husband, a boyfriend or a former boyfriend. (Vic DeLucia/The

PICK A CITY, PICK A GUIDE

<P>
   You can get a head start on a real visit to a city by paying a
virtual visit on the Web. Which hotel? Look at them here.
Restaurants and bars? Of course. Shopping, working out, going to
the theater? They are all here, and much else besides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is Sidewalk, which is what it was called when it was a
Microsoft site. Last fall, Microsoft's money-losing Sidewalk was
absorbed by the TMCS (Ticketmaster) City Search site. Although if
you have a bookmark for sidewalk.com it will still work, you
wouldn't recognize what you used to use.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 70 cities in the country covered, you can do all
of the above, as well as get a weather forecast, horoscope, movie
times, links to local Web sites and dozens of other things.
</P>
<P>
   You can reserve a hotel room or a theater ticket (with the usual
Ticketmaster surcharge of 10 percent to 15 percent), even find a
date or get a recipe (``Food editor Steven Stern sings an ode to
the humble sausage in all its varieties''). The exact possibilities
differ from city to city. In New York, for instance, you can buy a
MetroCard on line.
</P>
<P>
   All this information and these services are not just for
travelers. In fact, City Search seems to be aimed primarily at
residents. But the effect is to give someone planning a trip the
kind of knowledge heretofore limited to the destination's
residents, especially those who don't mind doing research. Despite
its fullness, the site was pretty easy to navigate and moved along
swiftly most of the time. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   home.about.com/local &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its own content, provided by local people who are
named and pictured, this three-year-old site offers a huge
collection of links to hotels, restaurants and just about anything
else you can think of. But since you are dealing either directly
with the establishment or through a service independent of
About.com, what you can do on line will vary widely _ that is,
whether you can just gather information or can actually make
reservations or buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City site was divided into nine areas, not just the
five boroughs but also the Upper East Side, the East Village, and
so on. I checked out the ``New York: Downtown Site'' and found 35
links to subcategories for hotels, restaurants, theaters, even
``Downtown Legends,'' prose sketches that included W.H. Auden,
George Burns and G.G. Allin, a punk rocker described as ``perhaps
one of the most reprehensible people ever to live.''
</P>
<P>
   G.G. Allin aside, this is a quirky site, informative and fun.
There's plenty of shopping, weather reports, a joke of the day, and
hotels, hostels, bed-and-breakfasts in all ranges. The hotel site
alone includes the SoHo Grand, a ``large, expensive, swanky new
spot on Grand Street,'' and the Inn at Irving Place, which is
``decorated like your insane grandmother's sitting room.'' Using
About.com is like having an eccentric New York friend, steeped in
lore, planning your trip to the city. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   lastminutetravel.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sidewalk and About are for people who know where they are going.
LastMinuteTravel is for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   It was founded in April 1997 by David Miranda, a travel
marketer, and lists just-released offers from some 500 companies _
airlines, hotels, resorts, cruise lines, theaters and such _ which
you have to grab in a hurry. Scores of New York hotels were on
board (Secaucus, N.J., apparently counts as New York), the
offerings good for just a few days.
</P>
<P>
   There were no last-minute flights from New York to Los Angeles
the day I looked in. If you don't mind giving your name, e-mail
address, and ZIP code, however, LastMinute will put you on the My
Travel Minder service, and send an e-mail when the flight, or
hotel, or whatever becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   It should be emphasized that LastMinute is a listing service;
you deal directly with the listed establishment when the time comes
to reserve a seat or room. &QL;

   Tracing Freedom's Trail Through Philadelphia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Civil War, the Underground Railroad helped slaves
escape to freedom in the northern states and Canada, and
Pennsylvania played an important role in it. The Multicultural
Affairs Congress of Philadelphia recently published ``Underground
Railroad: Trail to Freedom,'' a guide to sites in the Philadelphia
area that were ``stations'' _ the various safe houses and other
sites along the secretive network where slaves on the run could
find refuge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only station stop in Philadelphia open to the public is the
Johnson House Historical Site. Used as a safe house, this tavern in
the Germantown area was frequented by Harriet Tubman and William
Still. But the guide documents 17 historical sites in Pennsylvania
that fugitive slaves may have stopped at in their quest for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Other stations include the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal
Church in Lancaster and William Still's Last Residence in
Philadelphia, the stopping place for an estimated 95 percent of
escaped slaves passing through Philadelphia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The brochure also illustrates the ambiguity of Philadelphia's
position on slavery. As an important port, Philadelphia was a place
where slaves were both traded and protected. Mother Bethel A.M.E.
Church, for example, was founded in 1787 and sits on the oldest
piece of land in the United States that has been continuously owned
by African Americans, at 419 Richard Allen Avenue. And a marker at
2 South Front Street designates the site of the London Coffee
House, where prospective buyers gathered to view and purchase
slaves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guides are free at the Philadelphia Visitors Center, 16th
Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard, or from (888) 999-4668. &QL;

   Danish Design Center Moves Into a New Home &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Danish Design Center, a showcase for Danish and
international industrial design and graphic arts, moved to new
headquarters overlooking Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen on Jan. 10.
The five-story building, created by a Danish architect, Henning
Larsen, is clad with an energy-conserving double-glass screen that
provides natural climate control.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conceived as a clearinghouse for the design industry, as well as
a museum for the public, the new building includes 9,700 square
feet of exhibition space, a store selling books; Royal Copenhagen
and Georg Jensen tableware and other design items; a cafe;
conference rooms, archives and offices. Several exhibitions can run
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   A current show, ``Every New Idea ... Is a Combination of Two
Existing Ideas,'' running through June 4, explores the
serendipitous fusion of objects into new concepts. The creative
process of Gianfranco Zaccai's Continuum design firm, of Italy and
the United States, is examined through photographs, videos,
diagrams and development models in ``Start Anywhere, But Step
Back,'' through March 26. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The design center is at 27 H.C. Andersens Boulevard, 1553
Copenhagen V; telephone (45) 3369-3369; www.ddc.dk. Open Monday to
Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Admission: $5.30, at the rate of 7.5 kroner to the dollar.

   A Caribbean Hotel Joins an Upscale Crowd &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A deluxe new Caribbean hotel, Point Grace, is scheduled to open
March 1 on a 12-mile white-sand beach along Grace Bay on
Providenciales. The beach is home to an assortment of upscale
resorts on the north shore of the island, also known as Provo, the
most developed of the Turks and Caicos, an archipelago rich in
coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   Point Grace incudes two four-story building in British Colonial
style, with a total of 23 with one-, two- and three-bedroom suites.
There are also four cottages, with a total of 10 suites, and two
villas, built in gardens and each with a pool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to local lore, Grace Bay is named for a woman who
spent her honeymoon on Provo more than a century ago. A house
similar to her honeymoon cottage will be Point Grace's reception
area, where Continental breakfast will be served, along with hot
and iced cappuccino, espresso and tea throughout the day and wine
and hors d'oeuvres in the evening, all free.
</P>
<P>
   Adjoining the reception area will be a business center, a TV
lounge and a library with books, CDs and DVDs. The cottage sits
beside a pool, where casual lunches will be served. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suites are outfitted with kitchens with Italian granite
counter tops, Turkish-marble bathroom vanities, Indonesian teak
furniture, silk and cotton fabrics, king-size beds, Frette linens
and robes, and silk-screened Indonesian sarongs. Each afternoon,
fresh fruit sorbet will be served on the beach; housekeepers will
turn down linens at night and light bedside oil lamps (scented if
preferred).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-season double rates at Point Grace, Post Office Box 700,
Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands, British West Indies,
(888) 682-3705, fax (649) 946-5097, start at $395 in a cottage
suite, plus 19 percent for tax and service; it drops to $275 on
April 25. The use of water-sports equipment and a shuttle to
restaurants are included. &QL;

   Topkapi: You Saw the Movie, Now See the Jewels &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of imperial jewels and other treasures from the
Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, including many that have never before
left the palace, will be seen this year in Washington, San Diego
and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 200 objects that will be on view in the show, ``Palace
of Gold and Light, Treasures From the Topkapi, Istanbul,'' are a
16th-century ebony and ivory throne, inlaid with mother-of-pearl,
thought to have been used by Sultan Sulayman I, the Turkish
lawgiver, conqueror and patron of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Of perhaps more popular interest is the 18th-century dagger,
originally meant as a gift for Nadir Shah of Iran, that was the
focus of the 1964 film ``Topkapi,'' in which Melina Mercouri, Peter
Ustinov and Maximilian Schell portray thieves who stumble over one
another trying to steal it. The dagger has three large emeralds in
its handle and a fourth concealing a watch, as well as rows of
diamonds on both sides of the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the show are Ottoman textiles and silk robes, wool and
silk carpets, armor, porcelains and musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens March 1 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, 17th
Street and New York Avenue NW, Washington, and runs until June 15.
The Corcoran is open daily, except Tuesday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
and until 9 p.m. on Thursday. Admission is $10 for nonmembers and
$8 for members, students and those older than 60. Information:
(202) 639-1700.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop will be the San Diego Museum of Art, 1450 El Prado
in Balboa Park, where the exhibition will run July 14 to Sept. 24.
The museum, which is open every day except Monday, has not set the
hours or admission fees for the show. Information: (619) 232-7931.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop will be the Museum of Art, 1 East Las Olas
Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, from Oct. 15 to Feb. 28, 2001. The
museum is open noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday,
Wednesday and Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursday; closed
Monday. Admission fees have not been set. Information: (954)

 SANTANA'S STAYING POWER: `Supernatural,' living up to its
name,  could sweep Grammys   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAFAEL, Calif. _ Carlos Santana was caught with his pants
down when this year's Grammy nominations were announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just gotten out of the shower,'' he recalled. ``My wife
had this beatific smile. She said, `Hey, Mr. 11 Nominations!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, all butt-naked and wet.'' He laughed, pushing back
his familiar felt hat. ``I said, `You're kidding me.' That part
still hasn't hit me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbrushed teen idols aside, the pop story of 1999 was Santana's
``Supernatural'' ability to attract three generations of listeners.
With an amazing 6 million copies sold in the United States to date,
according to SoundScan, the album has hovered around the peak of
the charts for several months. Each time a blockbuster debut steps
down after its cursory week on top, the Santana record reclaims its
No. 1 position.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Santana will cap an extraordinary year with the
Grammy Awards ceremony, where the 52-year-old guitarist and
bandleader is all but certain to win at least a few of the 10 or 11
Grammys (depending on who's counting) he has been nominated for,
including album of the year, best rock album and record of the year
for ``Smooth,'' his smash single with Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20.
The nominations put Santana among the all-timers; Michael Jackson
and Babyface share the record with 12 nominations apiece in 1983
and 1992, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Weirdly, this year's 10 Grammy nods are twice as many as
Santana's entire previous haul _ five minor nominations meted out
over a remarkable 30-year career, one that includes two other No. 1
albums (1970's ``Abraxas'' and 1971's ``III''), working
relationships with some of the best in the business (John Lee
Hooker, Miles Davis) and a 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of theories have been floated about the key to
``Supernatural's'' success. They range from Santana's reunion with
Clive Davis, the industry bigwig who first signed the band 30 years
ago, to the new album's well-manicured parade of guest artists
(Thomas, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Eric Clapton) to the recent
pop commotion over all things Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, much of the credit can be traced to a simple choice of
words. Just weeks before the release of the new album last spring,
Santana was still telling visitors it would be called ``Mumbo
Jumbo.'' At the last minute, he changed the title to
``Supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   To Santana, it was a minor adjustment. The term ``mumbo jumbo''
has African origins implying supernatural powers. Over the years,
however, those words have come to mean something very different:
Malarkey. Gibberish. The illusion of competence rather than the
competence itself.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing misleading, on the other hand, about
``Supernatural.'' Obviously, the album had no choice but to meet
its destiny.
</P>
<P>
   To put the ``Supernatural'' story into perspective for himself,
Santana said a few days ago in the conference room of his
management office in San Rafael that he thought about retired 49ers
Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott. Both were just elected to the NFL's
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He saw them on TV, holding hands, thrilled to culminate their
careers together. ``That was the max for them,'' Santana said.
``The band did that two years ago'' _ got inducted into the Hall of
Fame _ ``and now it's like we're in the Super Bowl again.''
</P>
<P>
   As effortless as he is with those signature sustained guitar
notes, Santana certainly knows how to sustain a metaphor, or two or
three. Over the course of a relaxed, hourlong conversation, he
compared making and selling records to pumping gas and dealing
cars, promoted interracial compassion by invoking news images of
civilians directing traffic after the 1989 earthquake and talked
about people validating their existence by signing their own checks
at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play tennis by yourself,'' he said, referring to all
those ``Supernatural'' guest artists. ``You can't play
hide-and-seek by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play all the instruments and write all the songs.
What are you going to do, buy all the records, too? Nobody's
relating to that except you.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the all-star approach to ``Supernatural'' came
at the suggestion of Santana's old mentor, Davis, and his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure the company wouldn't have hired me without
(Davis),'' Santana said. ``They probably told him he was losing his
touch.'' Santana floundered through most of the '90s. His 1992
debut on Polygram went nowhere; most of the attention he could
muster in recent years came for nostalgic reasons, such as the
``Dance of the Rainbow Serpent'' boxed set and an archival
recording from the Fillmore.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly Carlos Santana is as happening as the Old Navy
lady. And ``Supernatural,'' he suggested, has the staying power of
some of the greatest rock records. ``When you put it next to Jimi
Hendrix's first three records, or Cream or the Doors, it's going to
stick around. I know. I've tested it. I've played it next to those
records until 3 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each song flows, and of that I am really proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The music industry agrees. Many of his friends and collaborators
sent congratulatory flowers the day after the Grammy nominations
were announced; the tidy San Rafael office, located on a
nondescript row of light industrial businesses, was full of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a standing ovation from the people in the office when I
came in. I tell you _ it's great to be alive and smelling the
flowers, instead of dead and smelling them from down there.'' He
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just grateful you don't see me on those `Where Are They
Now?' shows. Like anybody, you have valleys and deserts, and you
step in doggie doo-doo in the park. But I want my life if possible
to be a triumph, not a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial success of ``Supernatural'' has already been a
validation, he says. A few Grammy wins would add to the excitement,
but he is not counting on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me success, or progress, is when you make people dance, cry
and laugh at the same time. If you're drunk, the music should make
you sober, and if you're sober it should make you drunk. That's the
test of real music to me.''

GUILTY PLEAS SEEN IN LAUNDERING OF RUSSIAN MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two major suspects in the federal investigation into
the illegal transfer of billions of dollars from Russia through the
Bank of New York have agreed to plead guilty to money-laundering
charges, people involved in the inquiry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects _ Lucy Edwards, who was a senior officer at the
Bank of New York, and her husband, Peter Berlin, whose company,
Benex International, controlled the accounts through which the
money was moved _ were expected to arrive in New York from London
on Tuesday to surrender to the federal authorities, a
law-enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are the most serious to arise from the investigation
that began in the fall of 1998 when officials in the United States
and Britain discovered that billions of dollars were passing
through a handful of accounts at the Bank of New York. The
investigation was made public last August, but no major arrests
have yet been made.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Edwards and Berlin were unsuccessful; their
home in London was dark Monday night. In New York, their lawyer, T.
Barry Kingham, said through an assistant that he would have no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the office of the FBI in New York, which is
conducting the inquiry, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York declined to comment Monday on any aspect of
the charges against Edwards and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the investigation said Edwards and Berlin had
agreed to plead guilty to several criminal charges, including
conspiracy to commit money laundering, visa fraud, wire fraud and
bribery of a bank official. Details of the charges were not
immediately known, including the identity of the official or the
bank involved in the bribe.
</P>
<P>
   The person providing the information said Edwards and Berlin had
also agreed to forfeit $8 million that had been seized in their
personal accounts by the federal authorities last fall, when they
were indicted in New York on relatively minor charges, including
transferring money without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin held intensive negotiations with the federal
authorities for several months, a person close to the negotiations
said. The sticking point was the money-laundering charge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another law-enforcement official said the U.S. authorities
needed the plea agreement to include a criminal charge that was
sufficiently serious to make the couple subject to extradition
under British law. Berlin and Edwards have lived in London since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is generally defined as the practice of taking
ill-gotten gains and passing them through a series of bank accounts
or businesses so that they appear legitimate. Under federal law,
money laundering is a crime only if the money comes from the
proceeds of serious crimes like kidnapping, extortion, murder or
bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Monday night exactly what the nature of the
money-laundering charge was against the couple. Justice Department
lawyers have argued during the negotiations that Edwards and Berlin
violated federal money-laundering laws when they moved the millions
of dollars they earned as commissions at Benex from their accounts
at the Bank of New York to personal accounts overseas, a lawyer
close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who rose quickly from office assistant to vice
president in the Bank of New York's Eastern Europe division,
largely because of her ability to bring in Russian business, was
dismissed by the bank in August after the investigation became
public.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Edwards and Berlin have decided to plead guilty to
money-laundering charges seriously complicates legal matters for
the Bank of New York. Lawyers with expertise in banking law said
that whenever a senior bank officer admits to such charges,
questions arise about the bank's own culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards may now also testify to federal prosecutors about senior
members of the bank to whom she reported, raising possible problems
for her former superiors.

   A spokesman for Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a former Bank of
New York executive who oversaw the division in which Edwards worked
and who has also been a focal point for the investigation, said she
had never been approached to discuss a plea agreement of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky, who resigned from the bank last fall after she was
suspended, has not been charged with any wrongdoing in connection
with the investigation. Kagalovsky's attorney, Stanley Arkin, said
Monday that his client had not ``been involved in anything which is
conceivably a violation of any law.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kagalovsky is married to Konstantin Kagalovsky, a senior
executive with a large Russian oil company called Yukos who
previously worked as a senior executive with a now defunct Russian
bank, Menatep. Konstantin Kagalovsky has not been charged with any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A business partner of Berlin and Edwards who was indicted along
with them last fall on charges of illegal money transfer, Aleksei
Volkov, has not entered into any plea agreements with federal
prosecutors, according to his lawyer in New York. Volkov now lives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the federal authorities indicted a former Bank of New
York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, on charges of making false
statements to investigators in connection with the money-laundering
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Kudryavtsev received about $30,000
from Edwards and her husband between 1995 and 1999. The complaint
said Kudryavtsev lied to investigators in August about having
received money from the couple and also lied about having any
knowledge of their business activities.
</P>
<P>
   Kudryavtsev's lawyer, Charles Adler, said the indictment of his
client was ``surprising and disappointing.'' He said she is not
involved in any plea negotiations with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, state and federal banking regulators formally
sanctioned the Bank of New York for ``deficiencies'' in its
anti-money-laundering practices, according to an agreement signed
by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the regulators did not impose any monetary penalties against
the bank and stopped short of more serious sanctions. The Federal
Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Department took the
Bank of New York to task for lax auditing and risk-management
procedures in businesses involving international banking, fund
transfers and stock listings for foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the regulators' actions were not more serious
reportedly came as something of a relief for bank officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, experts said the regulators' actions were unusual
measures taken because of substantial problems with the way the
Bank of New York supervised accounts handling funds from overseas,
particularly from Russia.

 &HT;    After glowing testimonies, Lewis expected to be out on bond
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pro football star Ray Lewis is expected to walk out of
the Fulton County Jail today after posting $1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors failed to persuade a judge Monday that the Baltimore
Ravens middle linebacker, accused of a double murder poses a flight
risk or a threat to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Doris Downs placed several restrictions on
Lewis along with the $1 million bond, including a curfew and
requiring him to stay in Maryland or Georgia until trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old All-Pro NFL player's family and friends embraced
each other, praised God and talked of having dinner after a
nine-hour hearing in the stifling courtroom. Lewis and his
attorneys shook hands and whispered to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Joseph Sweeting, indicted along with Lewis and
Reginald Oakley in the killings of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar
of Decatur, Ga. in Atlanta on Super Bowl night, was being
questioned and booked into the Fulton County Jail. Sweeting
surrendered to Atlanta police at about 11 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At Lewis' bond hearing, his legal defense team _ attorneys Ed
Garland, Don Samuel, Jana Harris and Max Richardson _ called 16
witnesses who gave glowing accounts of Lewis' kindness, generosity
and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black striped suit, Lewis displayed little emotion
in the courtroom. An exception was when Baltimore radio personality
Wenda Royster testified about when Lewis and other Ravens players
helped the family of a poverty-stricken child who had been shot in
an accident. The family _ there were 13 other children in the
household _ could not afford to continue paying the rent for the
girl's wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and the other players made sure the child had money for
the wheelchair and other medical needs and even carried the girl
from her second-floor apartment so she could go outside, Royster
said.
</P>
<P>
   As she testified, Lewis blinked a few times as he attempted to
hold back tears. At one point he put his hand on his face, but
quickly regained his composure.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the witnesses at the bond hearing were character
witnesses for Lewis. A Atlanta resident told the court she saw from
her apartment window the fight that resulted in two men being
stabbed to death after a night of Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Keeler testified she called 911 after she saw the
altercation just after 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up to a giant photograph of her neighborhood, she
pointed to the crime scene and told Garland what she had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw five men beating on two men who were pretty small,''
Keeler said. ``Shots were fired and then the five men took off
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeler could not say whether the assailants climbed into Lewis'
limousine. Police have said blood and knives were found in the
40-foot Lincoln Navigator the football player had rented.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of Lewis was close friend Warren Sapp, a
defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He told the judge he
had a deep trust in his former college teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give my children to Ray,'' Sapp testified.''They are
the most precious things I have and I would trust Ray to take care
of them anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors introduced only three witnesses after Downs ordered
the attorneys to wrap up the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest testimony against Lewis came from Lt. Mike Smith,
commander of the city's homicide squad. Smith said Lewis lied to
police and refused to give investigators the names of the people
who rode in his limousine the night of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator said Lewis gave them an incorrect name _ A.J.
Johnson _ as someone who was in the limousine and whose head was
injured in the melee that led to Baker's and Lollar's deaths.
Johnson has since been cleared in the deaths. But ``A.J.'' is also
the nickname of Reginald Oakley, the third man indicted in the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Bruce Harvey, recently hired to represent Oakley,
said he anticipates his client will surrender today. ``He maintains
his innocence,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Other damning evidence came from FBI agent Pewter McFarland. The
agent, a member of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's Crime
Scene Unit, said he searched Lewis' hotel room and found traces of
a ``reddish brown'' stain, which McFarland believed to be blood.
The stains were found on a white bathrobe, a tissue and on
pillowcases.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Hale, a latent fingerprint examiner with the GBI, said
prints that matched to Lewis, Sweeting and Oakley were lifted from
Lewis' eighth floor room at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The room was disheveled, a mess,'' McFarland said. ``There
were glasses and bottles everywhere, as well as a lot of clothes
hangers on the floor.'' There were no clothes in the room except
for the bathrobe and a black t-shirt on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, prosecutor Clint Rucker argued Lewis is a
flight risk. He said Lewis has obstructed justice and ''that in
itself is a crime. This highly responsible man that everyone has
praised should not be granted bond because he didn't even take the
time to call police.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis ''has been described as the most responsible man on the
planet,'' Rucker said. ``He takes care of everybody ... but for two
folks dead on the street, he just didn't have time. ''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Downs said the state failed to prove its case against
granting bond for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The judge enumerated the different occasions where Lewis spoke
to police the day of the killings and cited Lewis' offer to come
back from Hawaii after the Pro Bowl to cooperate with
investigators. She also noted that after Lewis missed his noon
flight to Hawaii, he called police and offered to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   When he met with police at his attorneys' house later that
night, he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot find where the state carried their burden to prove
the risk of fleeing,'' Downs said. ''The state did not present its
strongest evidence. Usually the state is proud to present its
strongest evidence, but I did not see that.''
</P>
<P>
   She ruled that Lewis must stay in Maryland and can only leave
the state to travel to Georgia in connection with this case. He
cannot consume alcohol or drugs and must adhere to a 9 p.m. nightly
curfew. He must also surrender his passport.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Baker and Lollar, the young men killed in the Jan.
31fight, left the courtroom shaking their heads. They declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted in their hometown of Akron, Lollar's grandmother,
Joyce Lollar, said she was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking to God for the guilty party to be punished,'' she
said. ``It don't matter if you have money. It don't mean you have
the right to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lollar mentioned that Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell had said he
would get justice. ``I'm holding him to it,'' she said.

ONE MILLIONAIRE'S FINAL ANSWER _ I DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mysterious millionaire chooses his bride from 50 willing
candidates at the Las Vegas Hilton showroom, and marries her on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?,'' a two-hour
special airing Tuesday on the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   Some chronically grumpy critics of TV might call this stunt
tacky. But the Fox executive who dreamed it up says they'd be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a nice, lovely, elegant show,'' says Mike
Darnell, Fox executive vice president for specials and alternative
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell is the good-humored guru whose previous Fox triumphs
include scary police chases, good pets gone bad and alien
autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' could trump them
all and stand forever as Darnell's piece de resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm not saying you won't find it somewhat weird,'' he
acknowledged. ``But you will not walk away thinking it's sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox taped the spectacle last Tuesday in the Vegas hotel-casino,
with Jay Thomas as the host. In the absence of a preview tape, we
have Darnell's description of the show.
</P>
<P>
   He said it begins with the 50 bachelorettes introducing
themselves on stage _ ``It looks pretty much like a Miss America
pageant _ while the wealthy bridegroom looks on. But you won't see
much of him yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a sort of pod,'' Darnell said. ``You can't see him
except his shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell said he's no chintzy millionaire. Selected from about
100 volunteer bachelor millionaires, he had to open his financial
records to Fox to verify that he's worth over $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox has been guarding the groom's identity. It will say only
that he's in his early 40s, ``attractive,'' never been married and
doesn't live with his mother. Also that he's not a computer nerd;
Darnell said his wealth derives from ``several different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the show. The field of prospective brides, none of whom
will have met the millionaire, will be pared to 10 semifinalists.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 then take part in a compatibility quiz devised by the
producers and the millionaire. Viewers will also meet the groom's
friends and family members _ including his mother _ backstage.
They'll be posting their own ratings of the bachelorettes.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there is a ``beachwear competition.'' There's a good
reason, Darnell said: ``We explain that our millionaire is an
outdoorsman.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell added, ``They chose whatever they wanted to wear. Most
of them went with two-piece swimsuits, but with taste. Whatever
they were comfortable wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The women were culled from more than 1,000 who answered ads from
the network. Darnell said the youngest contestant is 22, the oldest
40. Among the original 50, he said, there are ``regular-looking
women.''
</P>
<P>
   The semifinalists are trimmed to five finalists, who emerge in
wedding gowns to answer ``intimate questions.'' One example: Name
three things your husband can do to make you happy, and three
things to make you unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next we reveal our millionaire,'' Darnell said. He'll be
introduced in a prepackaged video piece, then make his appearance
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   At the climactic moment, the millionaire will approach one of
the five finalists, all still in wedding gowns, and propose to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have said no when he proposed,'' Darnell said. But
she didn't. A Nevada judge turns up to perform the wedding
ceremony, while the showroom audience watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very romantic,'' Darnell said.
</P>
<P>
   There are lovely parting gifts from Fox. The bride gets a
$35,000 engagement ring, not that it's a lengthy engagement, and a
new car. A honeymoon in an undisclosed location is part of the
deal, too.
</P>
<P>
   If the show posts big ratings, more multimillionaire TV weddings
are likely. May sounds good to Darnell; it's the next ratings
sweeps month.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada is a community property state.

BRADLEY, OUTRAGED, DEFENDS HIS HEALTH PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A visibly incensed Bill Bradley lashed into Vice
President Al Gore for turning sharply negative in recent days,
accusing him of resorting to ``outrageous scare tactics'' in
criticizing Bradley's plan for universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   Straying from his typically even-tempered manner, Bradley
appeared red-faced and almost speechless with anger during a news
conference he called to rebut accusations by Gore, printed Monday
in The San Francisco Chronicle, that Bradley's health care plan
would deprive people with HIV and AIDS of health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another example of a kind of meanness in politics
that is fundamentally destructive of an open dialogue on issues,''
said Bradley, who was flanked by several leaders of gay and lesbian
groups in San Francisco. ``It was the worst use of scare tactics
that I had seen in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Gore's latest attack ``made my blood boil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's outburst came two days after Gore used a speech before
a convention of the California Democratic Party to return to the
harshly negative attacks on Bradley's campaign agenda and character
that he had first used much earlier in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During that speech, Gore asserted that Bradley had ``attacked
and demeaned'' the Democratic Party by criticizing the Clinton
administration. Bradley, by contrast, had refrained from making his
harshest attacks on Gore in his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley's plan would hurt poor people with HIV because
it called for abolishing Medicaid, the government health care
program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says his plan would call for current Medicaid recipients
to receive coverage under the system of private insurance that now
covers federal employees, which he contends would be superior to
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who delivered education speeches Monday in Rochester,
N.Y., and Brooklyn and attended a fund-raiser in Manhattan on
Monday night, did not respond himself to Bradley's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said, ``Bradley's
health plan would replace Medicaid with a $150 monthly voucher,
which will not begin to cover the many services required by people
with HIV/AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley has had six months to refute Al Gore's
challenges on the merits,'' he said, ``and he has been unable to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had begun the day with a speech at the Sierra Club in
downtown San Francisco in which he assailed Gore's record on the
environment, accusing him of conducting policy by photo opportunity
and repeatedly failing to protect sensitive ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Sharply hitting Gore on one of his strongest issues, Bradley
ticked off a list of promises Gore had made before the 1992
election that the administration had failed to honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has been long on promise and short on
action,'' Bradley said. ``To be a custodian of the natural world
means more than paddling a kayak for TV cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was referring to a campaign event last summer where Gore
paddled a canoe down the Connecticut River in New Hampshire. It was
later reported that a local power company had released millions of
gallons of water into the river during a drought to ease Gore's
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Bradley Monday was Brent Blackwelder, president
of the Friends of the Earth, a small national environmental group
that has endorsed Bradley, and Stewart Udall, who was secretary of
the interior for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and other national environmental groups have so
far stayed neutral in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore, who has written a book on global warming, was
considered a strong advocate for the environment before 1993, many
environmentalists have expressed disappointment with the
administration's environmental record over the last seven years.
And Bradley was clearly trying to stoke that dissatisfaction
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgent got the loudest applause from the crowd of 150
people when he attacked the administration's recent decision to
extend 36 off-shore drilling leases along the California coast.
Bradley has criticized Gore for not fighting within the
administration to block the extensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president's silence is loud and clear,'' Bradley
said. ``And if he hasn't fulfilled the promises he made in 1992,
why should we believe the promises he's making today?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also asserted that the administration has bent
environmental rules to help big campaign contributors. He cited a
case in which the administration backed the construction of a
shopping mall in the environmentally sensitive New Jersey
meadowlands. The developer was a major contributor to Gore's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to rid our political system of the taint of political
money, just as we rid our world of the stain of pollution,''
Bradley said. ``I don't think it's acceptable that we sacrifice
protection of our natural world to campaign fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, said, ``Attacking Al
Gore on the environment is like taking on Bill Bradley over
basketball. This administration is the most pro-environment in a
generation thanks to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used his speech to outline a concept he calls ``the land
ark,'' which would use federal funds to create protected habitats
for endangered species on federally owned land.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would ban all off-shore drilling along the
California and Florida seashores, expand federal programs intended
to conserve privately owned land and cut subsidies for mining, oil
exploration and livestock grazing on federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bradley trailing Gore by a substantial margin in
California, which holds its primary on March 7 along with about a
dozen other states, including New York.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said Bradley believes he must win, or at least stay
very close to Gore here, to keep his underdog campaign alive. To
that end he is likely to spend part of every week in California
until March 7.

IN SEARCH OF A SINGLE SENSATION AT THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW

 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The baker's dozen of standard poodles trotted around
Ring 1 at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Monday, offering a
parade of cream, black and brown bouffant coifs, feathery ears,
snowball tails and pompom ankles. How do you choose the best of
breed?
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Jacklyn E. Hungerland, observed them with a trace of
a smile as they trotted around the ring, led by their handlers. She
examined each dog individually: their teeth, eyes, back, legs,
chest, muzzles and tufts of fluff.
</P>
<P>
   At the last breed judging of the first day of the two-day show,
a crowd of canine lovers cheered, hooted and hollered. (No one
screamed, ``You the dog!'') Ch. Aleph Blue Skies Outrageous
received most of the applause. ``He's very famous,'' a fan said
knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   Hungerland narrowed the field to six, including Ch. Unique Reach
for the Rainbow, the rambunctious one in the bunch. All the
excitement made him bark and rear back.
</P>
<P>
   Hungerland eyed the semifinalists, walking slowly past each one.
She took no notes as she searched for each dog's essential
poodleyness. She sent the six on a half-circuit around the ring.
</P>
<P>
   More barking from the rowdy poodle. Then, another full circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, her choice: Ch. Lake Cove That's My Boy, known
familiarly as Treson, over Ch. Davroff Stolichnaya, a similarly
cream-colored dog.
</P>
<P>
   The 3{-year-old Treson won his breed and the Nonsporting group
at last year's show, and went on to be the No. 1-ranked dog in the
country in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hungerland described her methodology in decidedly unscientific
terms. ``It's difficult,'' she said. ``The two cream-colored ones
were so close. They each have their merits and little quirks, but
one of them eventually stands up and says, `It better be me and
that's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 124th edition of the Westminster, which continues Tuesday,
is a kaleidoscope of 156 breeds and 2,500 dogs. The best-of-breed
winners compete in seven group competitions, from which a single
winner will be chosen Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After the dalmatian judging, the sweet embrace between Cheryl
Bartell and Ch. Mt. Bryton's Eau De Chloe indicated victory for the
4-year-old bitch. Chloe licked Bartell, her co-owner, and Bartell
kissed Chloe. ``Oh, do you want steak?'' Bartell asked, as if she
were offering fine victory chow. But Chloe had earned only an award
of merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should have won,'' Bartell said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Mary Lou King swooped her papillon, Ch. Loteki Beach
Party, called Bikini, into her arms when the dog was declared best
of breed. King's saucer-eyed toy bitch took the acclaim in stride.
But King was ecstatic, rushing with Bikini in hand to telephone her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this six other times before,'' she said, referring
to her streak of breeding six of the Westminster's last seven best
papillons, including Kirby, last year's captivating best in show.
``But it's the first time I've been on the other end of the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   She stood outside the ring, where her 3-year-old had beaten 21
other overwhelmingly adorable rivals, and fed Bikini pieces of a
hot dog. ``She absolutely loves doing this,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, in the dimly lighted benching area, where the dogs
are shaved, trimmed, combed and blow-dried, Karen Cramer
contemplated the final performance of Ch. Glengarry Chatterbox, her
6-year-old Dandie Dinmont terrier. Sassy, as she is known, left
with an award of merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bitch who won is a good bitch,'' Cramer said, while
combing the tan hair on Sassy's head. ``But mine was the No. 1
Dandie Dinmont of the year.'' Sassy will be bred next month, but
Cramer knows one thing about her: ``She'd rather be a show dog than
a mom.'' The evidence? When Sassy sees Cramer packing for a trip,
``she jumps into the suitcase.''
</P>
<P>
   The benching area is the canine clubhouse, a place for
preparation and conversation, with no argument over which music to
play. Here, an Akita's coat received a spritz of hair spray; locks
of hair from a Siberian husky took flight in service to his sleek
grooming; the majestic white Great Pyrenees sat stoically through
vigorous last-minute brushing and the miniature poodles underwent
more intensive teasing than Little Richard.
</P>
<P>
   But the action, of course, is in the rings. After Ch. Reignon
Dassin Alexandra won best of breed among 14 miniature poodles, her
coif was steadied with a spritz of hair spray for a photo
opportunity. Joseph Vergnetti, Alex's ponytailed handler, co-owner
and co-breeder, exulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the judge saw Alex's poodle attitude,'' Vergnetti
said, sweating after several vigorous trots around the right with
his 4-year-old. ``She's loaded with charisma.''

DOG LOVER FINALLY HAS HIS DAY AS JUDGE FOR TOP PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: see also DOG-SHOW) 
(DW) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe it all started when his mother, with the
frugality-before-frivolity ethos practiced by so many
Depression-era moms, wouldn't let him have a canine companion back
in Boston no matter how passionately he pleaded. Then as now, for
Chester F. Collier, dogs are serious, serious business.
</P>
<P>
   That's why nothing makes the 72-year-old Collier, Westminster
Kennel Club's president, more uptight than his duty to emerge, in
tuxedoed splendor, from a two-day sequestration straight into
Madison Square Garden's main arena Tuesday night to anoint the new
king (or queen) of the canine universe.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask his wife, Dorothy, a veteran of the once-in-a-lifetime
experience of judging best in show at Westminster. She is worried
that her husband, an otherwise unruffled senior vice president for
Fox News, may fret himself into a frenzy the way he did on the
career-altering day in his youth when, as an aspiring theater
director, he scored an interview with Oscar Hammerstein. The
project was ``Me and Juliet,'' the place was Boston, and the
thrill, apparently, was all Collier's. Still is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was, sitting in a theater talking to Oscar Hammerstein
himself; I almost had a heart attack, and I didn't get the job,''
marvels Collier, whose dreams of becoming ``the next Josh Logan
doing the next `South Pacific''' turned to pipe dreams once he
accepted a television post in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Collier did land the most coveted job in the dog
show hierarchy, passing final judgment at the Y2K rendition of the
124th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. And it has been an
obsession ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known for almost two years that this night was going to
come,'' said Collier, whose office is decorated with three busy
television sets. There's also a menagerie of canine replicas
ranging from a life-size Rottweiler (he loves Rotties, shepherds
and standard poodles) in repose atop his entertainment center to a
bobble-headed beagle (he thinks) figurine on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that I've spent two years thinking about
something that's going to be over in 15 minutes,'' he says of his
Andy Warhol waltz with fame. ``My only concern is picking the right
dog: there's no pressure like this.'' At least not for Collier, who
says that the two times his own show dogs, bouviers des Flandres,
won their breed and earned group placements at long-ago
Westminsters were ``on a par with winning my seven Emmys.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside here: Westminster 2000 is the culminating chapter in
the coffee table tome that the club commissioned on its history, so
after a quarter century behind the scenes as the show's go-to guy,
he finally plays leading man in this annual doggie drama. The
downside: Collier, whose Kennel Club cronies affectionately call
him a bit of a control freak for tweaking every last detail of the
show, has to steer clear of the premises and remain ignorant of the
seven finalists, per his own rules, until summoned for the big
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we could get rid of him for two days was to have
him judge best in show,'' the show's chairman, Ron Menaker, said.
``I don't think he's too enamored of staying away. But when you
think Westminster, you think Chet, and to think he'd never judged
here, well, this was the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier's timing has not always been perfect. The day he met
Hammerstein, he assumed the interview portended his big break from
local theater to Broadway. Instead, he found himself teaching
speech and drama at Cathedral High School until a friend tipped him
off to an opening at Channel 4, Boston's new television station.
Collier didn't even own a TV set when he was hired as a production
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd do television until I got to New York and got
into the theater, but that was 1952, and here I am still in TV,''
he says with a no-regrets grin. He did make it to New York in 1957
_ as national program director for Westinghouse Broadcasting. It
was Collier, a keen judge of human as well as canine talent, who
discovered Mike Douglas in Cleveland in 1961 (``I hired him for
$400 a week'') and plucked Regis Philbin from an obscure Saturday
night talk show in San Diego in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Collier was 38 when he showed his first dog, a bouvier, and in
1973 he was invited to join the boys at Westminster. (Ladies need
not apply, a tradition dating back to 1877. As is giving away all
show revenues: greyhound rescue, police dogs and guide dogs are
current causes).
</P>
<P>
   After surviving the bark, bite and beauty of 2,493 other
contenders, this year's seven finalists, with an American TV
audience of 18 million and dog-crazy fans from 26 other nations
tuned in, will be scrutinized by Collier. There is no runner-up,
hence the nerve-racking mandate to point at the right pooch; human
egos, canine stud fees and sirloin at Sardi's for the champ all
depend on it.
</P>
<P>
   If Collier has a favorite dog, and he does, this is not the time
to dwell on it. Fact is, his heart, after 15 dogless years spent
working, judging, and settling into a second marriage with the
blessing of three grown children from the first, now belongs to
Lola, the piquant, portable Norwich terrier who runs things at the
Colliers' home in Norwood, N.J. Here, then, is Tuesday night's
final mantra: ``I'm not supposed to pick a cute one; I'm supposed
to pick the best one.''

(ATTN: S.C.)  
 MCCAIN AND BUSH MAKE PLEA FOR CROSSOVER VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWOOD, S.C. _ With polls indicating a race down to the wire
in the Republican presidential primary on Saturday, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began the final
week of campaigning by pleading with independents and Democrats to
show up on Election Day and provide victory's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you, I beg you,'' McCain said at a lunchtime rally
attended by 500 people, ``whether you're Republican, Democrat,
Libertarian or vegetarian, get out and get your friends out. We've
got to get the greatest turnout in this state's history so that I
can serve my country once more.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossover voting is permitted in South Carolina primaries, as it
was in the New Hampshire primary that was won by McCain on Feb. 1,
and Bush, campaigning in Saluda, confessed that he feared
Democratic crossovers might hurt him on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned,'' he said. ``I just don't want
Democrats coming in to vote against me because they think my
opponent will be easier to beat in November.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll of South Carolina voters, released Monday by The
Los Angeles Times, showed McCain and Bush still essentially in a
tie. So crossover votes might very well decide the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain worked the state's northwest quadrant Monday with a
series of rallies and town hall meetings, he hammered the crossover
and turnout issue at every stop and said several times that he
sensed his plea was having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out to everybody,'' he said during a rally in
Anderson, where 400 people showed up. ``There's something going on
in this campaign that I saw in New Hampshire at the end that
enabled us to win with the best turnout ever. I'm exuberant. I'm
exhilarated. I believe we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cause is just,'' he said. ``We do not fear attacks. What
we know is that our message is correct and we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCain started the final week in South Carolina, he stuck
with the same themes that he adopted late last week, accusing Bush,
though seldom by name, of attacking him unfairly and distorting his
views; then he compared himself to Luke Skywalker, the ``Star
Wars'' hero who frequently found himself under heavy fire from all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Under no circumstances, McCain promised, would he engage during
the rest of the contest in negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of his decision late last week to pull an
advertisement in which he compared Bush to President Clinton on the
issue of honesty, a commercial for which he was severely
criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we win or lose,'' he told the crowd in Anderson, ``we
will not run any negative ads in this campaign. This kind of
savagery is not necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saluda, Bush repeated his criticism of McCain's votes in the
Senate for public financing of congressional elections and defended
his own attacks on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not savagery,'' Bush said, ``it's what we call full
exposure _ full disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for us and the Republican Party to
understand that our candidate is going to have to weather a
savaging attack if Al Gore is the nominee,'' Bush said. ``The idea
of me pointing out a major difference certainly is not savaging. It
is a difference of opinion, and I'm going to continue talking about
differences of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what approach he would take in the debate with McCain
on Tuesday night, he said, ``I'll be short of savagery.''
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony in Anderson at which he cut a ribbon to inaugurate
the opening of a criminal justice center, McCain struck a similar
note.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is being run on vision and hope,'' he declared.
``We're not having anything to do with negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain did not criticize Bush by name, he was unusually
pointed and personal in his criticism of President Clinton, as was
Rep. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been
accompanying McCain on many of his trips around the state and who
was a leader of the effort to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that Clinton had hurt the nation with his conduct in
the White House, especially, he charged, by turning the Lincoln
Bedroom into ``a Motel 6'' for campaign contributors and by failing
to be honest about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. He also accused
the president, and by implication Vice President Al Gore, of
shortchanging the nation on military funding and of caving in on
pork barrel issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' he said at every stop, ``I intend to beat Al
Gore like a drum. And I promise you this: When I get to the White
House, I will never lie to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, introducing McCain, said of Clinton: ``Times are good in
this country now, very good. But we're hurting because a man in the
White House has left us a wounded nation. We need to get healed.''

   ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP TO BACK GORE: Since Bill Bradley said last
month that Vice President Al Gore was being dishonest in denying
his past votes against abortion, the Gore campaign has worked
feverishly to secure an endorsement from abortion-rights
proponents, and that endorsement appears to be at hand. The
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is planning
to bestow its endorsement on Gore on Tuesday. Its past rating of
Gore, for voting in favor of abortion rights only 23 percent of the
time during his House tenure from 1976 to 1982, has been used
against him, but the group wants to repay the Clinton
administration for its strong support of abortion rights.

   NO TEXAS OFFICE FOR BRADLEY: Vice President Al Gore's campaign
opened a Texans for Gore office in Austin on Saturday in
anticipation of the state's March 14 primary. But local forces for
former Sen. Bill Bradley say they have no plans to open a state
headquarters. ``We don't spend money on space,'' said Peck Young,
political director for Bradley's Texas campaign. ``We spend money
on volunteers and materials. We really don't need a place for
people to hang out and drink Cokes.'' Garry Mauro, a former state
land commissioner and longtime friend of President Clinton, will
lead the vice president's Texas campaign. Bradley's effort will be
led by John Sharp, a former state comptroller.

   THE WAGES OF NEGATIVITY: Negative advertisements seem to be
effective _ in helping the candidate being attacked. In a Los
Angeles Times poll released on Sunday, 70 percent of the
Republicans surveyed said they had seen negative campaign
advertisements. But 64 percent of that group said the
advertisements made them react more negatively to the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   THE STANDINGS IN OHIO: Gov. George W. Bush is still well ahead
of Sen. John McCain in Ohio, the latest poll shows, but his lead
has shrunk in the last month. The Ohio Poll, conducted over the
week that ended last Wednesday by the Institute for Policy Research
at the University of Cincinnati, found Bush ahead, 59 percent to 25
percent. A Jan. 19 poll had Bush ahead, 64 percent to 19 percent.

BUSH ADVISER, YEARS AGO, HELPED DRAFT A PUSH POLL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has expressed outrage
at the accusation from the McCain camp that his campaign is
involved in the controversial political technique known as push
polling, in which workers posing as pollsters spread negative
charges about a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has threatened to fire any campaign staff member involved
with push polls.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996 in Texas, however, Karl Rove, Bush's longtime
political adviser and the chief architect of his presidential
campaign, helped draft a push poll, financed by the tobacco
industry, that was used in an effort to thwart a planned state
lawsuit against the tobacco companies. At the time, Rove was both a
top consultant to Bush and a $3,000-a-month consultant to Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the 1996 push poll was the attorney general of
Texas, Dan Morales, a Democrat. At the time, Morales was preparing
to file a lawsuit against several tobacco companies to seek
reimbursement for billions of dollars that the state had spent on
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Morales, who )s no longer attorney
general, said the pollsters had used negative and false information
about his record in an effort to sway the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the survey shows that it included more than a dozen
negative statements about Morales' record as attorney general.
Morales says the poll distorted his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said that the results, which showed that most Texans
rated a tobacco lawsuit as a low priority, were shared with him by
a Philip Morris lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to use the results of this poll to intimidate me
into not filing the lawsuit,'' Morales said. ``I was not surprised
by the effort. But it was somewhat disconcerting to see the dual
rol% that Rove was playing, as chief Philip Morris lobbyist for
Texas while he was the chief political consultant to the governor
of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Morales filed the lawsuit against the tobacco
companies. And in January 1998, the industry settled the lawsuit
with the state of Texas for $15 billion, a figure that was
eventually increased to $17.3 billion, including $2.3 billion in
fees to the five lawyers and firms for the plaintiffs. Bush took no
position on the merits of the lawsuit, but after the settlement he
called the fees awarded to plaintiffs' attorneys ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said:
``Mr. Rove's role was only to review a fifth draft of a survey that
had been written by someone else and to suggest that a copy be
shared with the attorney general. That was the extent of his
role.''
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition conducted in 1997, Rove acknowledged that he had
offered suggestions about the poll's questions and demographics and
recommended that a copy of the results be provided to Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Rove was a consultant to Philip Morris from 1991 to December
1996. He said he ended his representation of Philip Morris in
December 1996, in part to avoid bringing controversy to Bush. But
from January 1995 to December 1996, the two jobs overlapped.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of push polling erupted in South Carolina last week as
a bitterly divisive issue between the McCain and Bush campaigns. It
began when a distraught woman told Sen. John McCain that her
teen-age son had taken a call from a pollster who portrayed McCain
as a ``cheat and a liar and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush angrily denied that the call came from one of his pollsters
and has released the scripts used by some of them to prove that his
campaign is not spreading falsehoods about McCain. Some Bush
operatives have privately pointed fingers at McCain's advisers for
past client work that involved push polls.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Rove said that after the poll was conducted,
he delivered a copy to Joe Allbaugh, an executive assistant to Bush
and now his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said that Allbaugh did not give the document to Bush but
instead ``put it in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco push poll was conducted by Public Opinion
Strategies, an Alexandria, Va., firm. Neil Newhouse, a partner at
the firm, did not return calls Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HER _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morales said that in the push poll that Rove helped draft, his
positions on an array of issues, including gun control and
affirmative action, were mischaracterized. And he said respondents
had been influenced by the false information. ``They said
conservative groups rated me as a left-leaning, liberal Democrat,
which is simply not true,'' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Opinion Strategies summarized its findings this way:
``The lawsuit is opposed by a strong majority of Texans, and they
express skepticism over the motives of the attorney general on the
issue. Dan Morales is in good shape politically, but he has some
areas of softness, and others of outright vulnerability. The lack
of support for the lawsuit _ especially since it is being filed by
private lawyers who stand to gain after contributing to the
attorney general's campaign _ is a clear vulnerability for the
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales did not seek re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Public Opinion Strategies has a new client in the 2000 political
race: John McCain.

   For over a decade, the dry cleaning business has looked like a
tantalizing opportunity for environmentally minded entrepreneurs.
Despite increasing regulations aimed at cutting air pollution and
groundwater contamination, not to mention criticism from groups
like Greenpeace and Consumers Union, a vast majority of the
nation's roughly 33,000 dry cleaners persist in using toxic
chemicals linked to cancer, nervous system ailments and other
health hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green cleaners'' using water and new biodegradable detergents
sprang up in many communities in the 1990s, with some reporting
customers coming from 20 miles or more away.
</P>
<P>
   But few existing dry cleaners were inclined to switch because
``wet cleaning'' takes longer, increases labor costs and can easily
lead to shrinkage or other quality problems. Many felt vindicated
when Ecomat, a wet cleaner that featured ad slogans like ``Is Your
Dry Cleaner Killing You?'' went bankrupt in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now the green spotlight is being claimed by Hangers Cleaners,
which is trying to sell the industry and its customers on a
radically different technology. Hangers uses a biodegradable soap
dissolved not in water but in liquefied carbon dioxide, a substance
so safe it is used to decaffeinate coffee and inject the fizz into
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Hangers' backers see it as a high-profile model of ``green
chemistry,'' the unofficial name that in 1991 government officials
gave to various programs aimed at weaning society from its reliance
on noxious chemicals. Repeat business at the first stores is high,
and potential franchisees have signed up for more than 40
territories ranging as far west as Lincoln, Neb., according to
Micell Technologies, which owns the technology and the Hangers
name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hangers has been on a slower track than it hoped when its
technology won the Environmental Protection Agency's Green
Chemistry Challenge Award in 1997. Rather than the 500 outlets and
$50 million in sales it expected by the end of last year, it has
opened only a handful of stores, providing strong evidence that
environmental benefits matter only after customers are satisfied
about cost, quality and convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental opportunity can't lead change,'' conceded
Kirk Kinsell, chief executive of Micell, based in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the hurdles Hangers has encountered underscores how
constant improvements in existing technology and numerous other
competitive factors affecting a particular business can slow
environmental innovation, even in industries that look simple to
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Hangers' main public face so far has belonged to Joseph M.
DeSimone, an energetic 35-year-old professor of chemistry and
chemical engineering at the University of North Carolina and North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Although the build-up of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere
has been cited as a big factor in global warming, DeSimone is one
of many researchers investigating compressed or liquefied carbon
dioxide as a substitute for other chemicals because it is widely
available, inexpensive and much less hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   DeSimone was diverted from his initial research on how liquefied
carbon dioxide could replace toxic chemicals used in making plastic
by the realization that it could also stand in for
perchloroethylene, a widely used industrial chemical that is the
most popular dry-cleaning solvent. Perc, as it is known, had become
a big concern for government regulators because of strong evidence
that it causes cancer, and possibly numerous other ailments, for
cleaning workers and even residents of nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Perc vapors and discharges also contaminated groundwater. By the
1990's, dry cleaners were the biggest remaining source of such
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The key was to develop a detergent that could dissolve in carbon
dioxide, because even though carbon dioxide penetrates clothing
easily, it does not bind to dirt, food or grease on its own. By
1996, the crucial detergent in hand, DeSimone and two former
students formed Micell with the first installments of what became
$20 million in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money came from Unifi, a large textile company based
in Greensboro, N.C., that had been tracking possible uses of carbon
dioxide in dyeing operations, and the George Soros Management Fund.
Unifi now owns 40 percent of Micell.
</P>
<P>
   Micell assumed it had a ready market in dry cleaners nervous
about perc, which earned a reputation as a versatile and powerful
degreaser during World War II and rapidly replaced the
petroleum-based solvents that had frequently been fire hazards in
the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental regulations were driving up operating and
waste-disposal costs for perc systems. Everything the chemical
touched except the clothes themselves was deemed a hazardous waste
as a result of the 1990 Clean Air Act, requiring extensive
paperwork and special disposal. Cities like New York passed
regulations requiring cleaners in residential buildings to close or
invest tens of thousands of dollars in new equipment that prevented
perc from being released. Some landlords pressured cleaners to
close down or switch to cleaner methods.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, though, cleaners are not as afraid of perc's
near-term future as Micell anticipated. Their equipment suppliers
developed systems so efficient that the entire industry used just
72 million pounds of perc in 1998, down from 235 million a decade
earlier. The newest designs virtually eliminated accidental spills
and emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Those that are moving away from the chemical are not necessarily
seeing Micell as their best option. Some are expanding their use of
water. Others are turning to the newest petroleum solvents, which
are making a comeback because suppliers like Exxon created improved
cleaners that are harder to ignite.
</P>
<P>
   Micell equipment design is also proving to be a major hurdle.
Its current cleaning system is easy to operate, but the 10-ton
rectangle of pipes, reservoirs, pumps and filters dwarfs anything
else on the market and is far too large for the cramped quarters of
many dry cleaners. More important, at $150,000 per unit, it is
often far too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Top-of-the-line perc systems handling similar-sized loads cost
about $60,000. Petroleum systems are not much more, and
wet-cleaning systems cost as little as $20,000. Many cleaners are
particularly reluctant to make big new capital investments after
enduring several years when the trend toward casual dress hurt
sales, which industry experts estimate were about $6.5 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Micell says its equipment cleans more quickly and reduces
operating costs in so many ways that the extra cost is recouped
within three years, assuming pricing matching higher-end cleaners.
But many in the industry remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited the first shop in Wilmington, N.C., and didn't see
any evidence that it's more productive,'' said William Seitz,
executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association
International, a New York trade group. Other cleaners say they were
convinced that the process was more productive and, because it
operates at room temperature, gentler on clothes, but not that it
could clean as well as perc.

WEATHERING THE STORM

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  SIMI VALLEY _ The Wood Ranch Golf Club's layout, with an
assist from Mother Nature, gave the LPGA fits during last weekend's
Los Angeles Women's Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Just six players finished under par in the three-round event,
played for the first time at the Simi Valley course.
</P>
<P>
   But the players' consensus on the quality of the course was
positive considering the miserable weather. Saturday's and Sunday's
rounds were played through steady rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough course. And when you throw in the wind and the
rain, it becomes even more difficult,'' said champion Laura Davies,
who finished 5-under par.
</P>
<P>
   At least two holes were deemed almost unplayable due to standing
water in the landing area. But that didn't prevent the leaders from
giving Wood Ranch a positive review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a great course and it would have been great to
play it a little later in the year, maybe in March or April,'' said
Carin Koch, one of three golfers to share second place behind
Davies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the time would make a difference, but the greens
held up really well considering. The whole course was well
maintained and I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Redman, another of the three runners-up, admitted the
bad weather kept the scores up. But even in the best of conditions,
the course wouldn't have made it an easy round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a pretty good golf course. The rough was tough; you
had to hit the ball straight, which I like. I think if they got the
fairways in a little bit better shape, it'd be great,'' Redman
said. ``You still have to hit the ball pretty straight here.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step is ensuring that the tour makes another stop at
Wood Ranch next year. The event was held at Oakmont Country Club in
Glendale for three years before Wood Ranch, the LPGA and tournament
promoter Group Dynamics Inc. struck a deal. The contract is for
three years, but each of the next two include an option to continue
the current setup for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do an evaluation whether or not to move forward for the
next two years,'' said Group Dynamics vice president Bob Collins,
who also served as the tournament's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's based on the (LPGA golfers), their contentedness for
the golf course. Also the LPGA's comfort level for the golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' group will meet with the LPGA, the city of Simi Valley
and Wood Ranch representatives to discuss the tournament's future
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Group Dynamics, an L.A.-based sports and
entertainment promotion company, has strived to develop a solid
working relationship with the city, Wood Ranch and its parent
company, American Golf Country Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament organizers had to round up more than 365 volunteers
who did various jobs on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key here is . . . building relationships and everyone
working together. That's what Simi Valley offers,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the city of Simi Valley. They want a big event.
They've got a big event. Now the key is for all of us to work
together to keep the event here so that it doesn't bounce around a
whole lot in the future.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Micell's decision to create the Hangers franchise concept to
market the technology is another complication. Micell figured
franchising and exclusive territories would help overcome cleaners'
qualms about the big investment in equipment. But many cleaners do
not believe the Hangers name is as valuable as the familiar names
that have often hung on their stores for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Bruce Barish, a third-generation owner of Ernest
Winzer Cleaners in the Bronx, say they are interested in the
technology but are leaning toward working with a competing dioxide
design from Global Technologies, an El Segundo, Calif., company
that has been progressing more slowly toward commercialization than
Micell. Global has licensed seven manufacturers to make machinery,
which it said will be widely available later this year with no
franchising strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   The market was muddied further by the sudden appearance last
year of Zoots, a Newton, Mass., enterprise founded by Thomas
Stemberg, the chairman and chief executive of Staples, and Todd
Krasnow, one of his top lieutenants. Zoots is counting on marketing
and expansion skills learned at Staples to help it quickly create a
nationwide cleaning company emphasizing drive-through service and
other conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnow, Zoots' chief executive, said that he wanted nothing to
do with perc but that petroleum cleaning systems met Zoots' quality
and environmental needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the marketing geniuses versus the technology
mavens,'' joked Sam Brickle, the 62-year-old Rhode Island
industrialist who bought the rights from Micell to develop the
Hangers concept in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Brickle, who owns the last major textile mills in the region's
once-thriving textile industry, knows plenty about competition. At
this stage of Hangers' development, such experience has become more
crucial to Hangers' chances of fulfilling its green-chemistry
promise than DeSimone's technical brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Brickle rejected Micell's original concept of locating its
machines in stores. His cleaning plant is in a former metal
recycling mill in an industrial park he owns. Some customers come
right to the plant, but most clothes arrive from the three Hangers
shops that have opened in recent months. The plan is to open three
more by summer and a total of up to 25 within a 20-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   Hangers of New England executives are also searching for
locations near Fairfield, Conn., Lowell, Mass., and Manchester,
N.H., to set up similar factories with satellite stores.
</P>
<P>
   Like many an investor in green-chemistry innovations, Brickle is
ending up more deeply involved than he originally envisioned. ``My
initial goal was to sell 1,000 franchises in New England,'' he
said, reflecting on his surprise at perc's continued hold on the
industry. ``Now it looks like we'll have to own a lot of them.''

   Michelle Kwan's victory in the women's competition on Saturday

BAIL IS SET AT $1 MILLION FOR LEWIS IN MURDER CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JON NORDHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A state judge ruled Monday night that All-Pro
linebacker Ray Lewis may be released on $1 million bail but must
remain at his home in Maryland except for court appearances here.
Lewis faces murder charges in connection with two stabbing deaths
after a Super Bowl party two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said it would probably take until Tuesday for
the bail arrangements to be made. Lewis, 24, a star of the
Baltimore Ravens, must remain in Fulton County Jail until then.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis buried his face in his hands at the announcement by Judge
Doris L. Downs of Superior Court and hugged his attorneys, his only
show of emotion after sitting through nearly seven hours of
testimony and argument.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens' owner, Art Modell, headed a group from the club who
came to Atlanta in support of Lewis. Modell, Ernest Byner, director
of player development, and Rod Woodson, a safety, all took the
stand along with a long line of other character witnesses to
portray Lewis as ferocious middle linebacker on the field but a
peacemaker off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a good citizen for the Baltimore Ravens,'' Modell
said. ``He's the first to respond to visit a hospital or a
children's home.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay defensive end Warren Sapp, his trademark long braided
hair falling on broad shoulders packed tightly in a dark business
suit, described his former teammate at the University of Miami as
easygoing and fun loving. ``I would entrust my kids with him, and
they are the most important parts of my life,'' he told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The bond hearing did not rest on Lewis' guilt or innocence, and
in fact the judge said that the state had determined ``not to
present the strength of its case today.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs said the state had failed to persuade her that Lewis posed
a danger to the community or would attempt to flee from
prosecution, the criteria for denying bail. She also said the
absence of a felony police record weighed in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, say he could not leave Maryland, his principal
residence, unless it was to appear in Georgia for proceedings in
his case. She also imposed a curfew for him to be home by 9 o'clock
every night and to completely abstain from consuming alcohol and
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what the curfew and the limits
imposed on his movements outside Maryland might do to his playing
career if his case was not resolved before next summer, when the
Ravens begin preseason games. Those close to the defense said that
if necessary, the court would be asked to adjust his bail
requirements to allow him to pursue his livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis became the National Football League's highest-paid
linebacker in 1998 when he signed a four-year contract worth more
than $26 million. Lewis, who is 6 foot 1 and 245 pounds, is
credited with 673 tackles in 60 pro games.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been held without bail since his arrest on Jan. 31,
the day of the stabbings. He and two companions were indicted last
week on murder and assault charges. Investigators said the three
were the principal figures in the attack on Richard Lollar, 24, and
Jacinth Baker, 21, who were stabbed during a fight outside an
Atlanta nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday one of the suspects, Joseph Sweeting of Miami,
turned himself in, a spokesman for the Atlanta police said. The
other suspect, Reginald Oakley of Baltimore, is still at large, the
police said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lewis and his party of 10 left the Cobalt Lounge in the Buckhead
section of Atlanta shortly before 4 a.m. What happened when some of
the men in Lewis' group tangled with a group of about a half-dozen
men while walking to his hired limousine remains in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers describe the scene as beginning with an exchange
of words that suddenly flared into an eruption of violence. They
argue that Lewis' only role was a short-lived attempt to drag his
companions away from the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the state's case apparently rests on the testimony of
the limousine driver, Duane Fassett of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When Ed Garland, the lead defense lawyer, tried Monday to get
Atlanta homicide detectives to divulge elements of interviews with
Fassett, the prosecution objected, saying hearsay evidence could
not be introduced at a bond hearing.

A MAN IS MORE THAN HALF A MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - His name was Ira Pomerantz.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when we didn't know who he was, which made it a
lot easier to talk and even (be honest) joke about his death and
the horrible things done to his body. But now we know.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Ira Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
   He was 60 years old and the father of grown daughters. He had
friends, a life, a past. He had hopes and dreams, though perhaps
fewer than when he was young. Then, one day in January, he
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, a deliv eryman described for Mesa po lice
how he watched a small, blond woman in a 1997 Jaguar pull up to a
trash bin behind the Bashas' supermarket at Mc Dowell and Power
roads. He said the woman hauled a large bundle from the car, lifted
it into the trash, then drove off.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a man's body, the torso. No arms or legs or head.
</P>
<P>
   In my business, we love these stories, and for good reason. We
love them because you love them.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day or so after the gruesome discovery, all the
television stations in town pro duced special logos that flashed
behind the news anchors when ever the story was discussed. ``Torso
Investigation,'' one said. And ``Torso Murder'' and ``Torso Case.''
</P>
<P>
   The new definition of TV news: A talking head discussing a
torso.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in the papers, even after the body had been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The woman behind the wheel of the Jaguar, a Scottsdale beauty
salon owner named Vale rie Pape, was arrested and eventually
charged with the murder of her husband, Ira Pomerantz. His body had
been cut apart, possibly with an elec tric saw.
</P>
<P>
   Pape said she found Pomer antz dead, lying in a pool of blood in
the kitchen of her Scottsdale home. Supposedly, a gun was nearby.
Pomerantz was shot in the back. Pape admitted tossing part of her
husband's body in the trash, but wouldn't say what happened to the
rest of him.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have described her as ``gentle,'' though it's difficult
to imagine such a person help ing to dismantle and dispose of human
being _ a person by the name of Ira Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long last name. It doesn't have the zip that ``torso''
does. ``Bullet found in torso case'' read one headline. And ``Torso
discovery horrifies, fas cinates Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   As if it's possible for a man to be less than the sum of his
parts.
</P>
<P>
   There was trouble in the cou ple's marriage, reporters learned.
There were accusa tions of violence, and struggling business
ventures. But there was at least one area of his life in which
Pomerantz had sup port. It came from his girls.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote a letter to a local newspaper that read in part:
``While we are in the process of mourning the loss of our father
and trying to understand his needless and brutal murder, we deeply
regret that the media has chosen to portray him in such a negative
and false light.''
</P>
<P>
   They went on to say, ``During the course of his (15 year mar
riage) to our mother he never abused her in any way and in our home
we were never ex posed to any abuse, whether physical or otherwise.
. . Throughout his life, he never failed those close to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know him. I don't know all of his faults or all of his
good qualities, only what I read in the papers and what his
daughters said about him.
</P>
<P>
   His name, however, was Ira Pomerantz. The next time some media
type calls him ``the torso,'' do his family a favor, do yourself a
favor, and remember what he really is _ the victim. &QL;

fewer than when he was young. Then, one day in January, he
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, a deliv eryman described for Mesa po lice
how he watched a small, blond woman in a 1997 Jaguar pull up to a
trash bin behind the Bashas' supermarket at Mc Dowell and Power
roads. He said the woman hauled a large bundle from the car, lifted
it into the trash, then drove off.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a man's body, the torso. No arms or legs or head.
</P>
<P>
   In my business, we love these stories, and for good reason. We
love them because you love them.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day or so after the gruesome discovery, all the
television stations in town pro duced special logos that flashed
behind the news anchors when ever the story was discussed. ``Torso
Investigation,'' one said. And ``Torso Murder'' and ``Torso Case.''
</P>
<P>
   The new definition of TV news: A talking head discussing a
torso.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in the papers, even after the body had been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The woman behind the wheel of the Jaguar, a Scottsdale beauty
salon owner named Vale rie Pape, was arrested and eventually
charged with the murder of her husband, Ira Pomerantz. His body had
been cut apart, possibly with an elec tric saw.
</P>
<P>
   Pape said she found Pomer antz dead, lying in a pool of blood in
the kitchen of her Scottsdale home. Supposedly, a gun was nearby.
Pomerantz was shot in the back. Pape admitted tossing part of her
husband's body in the trash, but wouldn't say what happened to the
rest of him.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have described her as ``gentle,'' though it's difficult
to imagine such a person help ing to dismantle and dispose of human
being _ a person by the name of Ira Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long last name. It doesn't have the zip that ``torso''
does. ``Bullet found in torso case'' read one headline. And ``Torso
discovery horrifies, fas cinates Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   As if it's possible for a man to be less than the sum of his
parts.
</P>
<P>
   There was trouble in the cou ple's marriage, reporters learned.
There were accusa tions of violence, and struggling business
ventures. But there was at least one area of his life in which
Pomerantz had sup port. It came from his girls.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote a letter to a local newspaper that read in part:
``While we are in the process of mourning the loss of our father
and trying to understand his needless and brutal murder, we deeply
regret that the media has chosen to portray him in such a negative
and false light.''
</P>
<P>
   They went on to say, ``During the course of his (15 year mar
riage) to our mother he never abused her in any way and in our home
we were never ex posed to any abuse, whether physical or otherwise.
. . Throughout his life, he never failed those close to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know him. I don't know all of his faults or all of his
good qualities, only what I read in the papers and what his
daughters said about him.
</P>
<P>
   His name, however, was Ira Pomerantz. The next time some media
type calls him ``the torso,'' do his family a favor, do yourself a
favor, and remember what he really is _ the victim. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reach Montini at Ed.Montini &LR; Arizona Republic.com or (602)
444-8978. &QL; 
 &QL; 
His name was Ira Pomerantz not ``The Torso.'' We should remember
that. &QL;

EUROPEANS MOVE TOWARD BACKING GERMAN TO LEAD IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The European Union appears set to back a German
Finance Ministry official to head the International Monetary Fund,
giving a boost to a candidate Clinton administration officials
privately argue is ill-suited for the job.
</P>
<P>
   European foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on
Monday, reached an informal consensus that Caio Koch-Weser, 55, a
longtime World Bank official who currently serves as a state
secretary in the German Finance Ministry, should succeed Michel
Camdessus as director of the monetary fund, German and European
Union officials said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The French, who had been viewed as cool to Koch-Weser, issued a
statement saying they would not block a European choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Brussels meeting was a success for Germany, which has sought
to foster a sense of inevitability about Koch-Weser's bid to take
over the IMF's leadership. Though European foreign ministers sent
signals Monday that they had rallied around the German choice, they
put off until at least Feb. 28 any official declaration that the
European Union would put its political muscle behind his candidacy.
That gives Germany two weeks to rally support for him around the
world without risking European loss of face if it is unable to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events is considered a setback for the Clinton
administration. It publicly remains neutral on Koch-Weser. But the
administration has made clear that it would prefer that Europe,
which has customarily named the head of the monetary fund, find
someone who is better known internationally and who has more
experience managing currencies and setting overall economic
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership change at the monetary fund comes at a sensitive
time. The fund, which is based in Washington, has more influences
than ever before over capitalist-oriented economies worldwide. From
Indonesia to Russia, the IMF not only provides billions of dollars
in aid and helps shape economic policies, but can also affect the
political fortunes of leaders who defy its lending conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Its operations are also under a microscope. The fund has been
criticized for mismanaging multibillion-dollar aid programs for
Russia and, most recently, Ukraine. Members of Congress have
expressed concern that money provided by the fund feeds corruption
in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has also pushed for changes at the
IMF. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has argued that the
fund should focus more on preventing or combating financial
emergencies and less on alleviating poverty, a task he says is
better handled by the World Bank. Koch-Weser, who spent 25 years at
the World Bank as a specialist in poverty relief, is not regarded
as having the right resume to carry out such changes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States and many developing countries are
watching from the sidelines as Europe fumbles its way toward
nominating a successor to Camdessus. While there is no groundswell
of support for Koch-Weser, he remains the only public European
candidate for the job after four months of debate. Germany's
steadfast campaign to put him in office appears to be wearing down
the French, who had earlier declined to offer any signal that they
would back Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
   He has also spoken out in his own cause, blaming an arcane
political process in Europe for harming his candidacy. In a recent
interview, Koch-Weser said his fluent English and leadership
experience at the World Bank made him a good choice to increase
political support for the monetary fund at a time when it is under
pressure to become more responsive to social and environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the fund needs is a chief executive who can get its
message across and increase support,'' he said. ``I do not think it
needs a technocrat who is more like a chief financial officer.''
</P>
<P>
   While the outcome is still uncertain, it seems increasingly
likely that the United States will have to choose between accepting
Koch-Weser or using its standing at the IMF to oppose him, perhaps
in alliance with some developing countries. Washington would have
to weigh the importance of finding what it considers an ideal
candidate for the post against the costs of straining relations
with European allies.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Monday that the United
States would in principle back a European choice for the job,
provided that person enjoyed broad support not just in Europe but
also in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   The signal from Brussels came the same day that Camdessus, the
Frenchman who led the monetary fund for 13 years, formally retired
as managing director. Stanley Fischer, the American who served as
the No. 2 officer at the fund, automatically became acting
director.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, 56, who has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, has long managed the daily operations of the fund and
shaped its huge financial bail-out packages for Asian and Latin
American countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not be worried at all about the health and the
efficiency of the IMF during this interim period,'' said Camdessus,
speaking at a conference in Bangkok, Thailand, during his final day
on the job.

NEWS CORP. STUDYING MERGER OF ITS SATELLITE UNITS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said Monday that it
was strongly considering consolidating all of its satellite-related
businesses into a single company that could provide Internet
service from space to nearly the entire globe.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. is expected to control the new company but could
offer a minority stake to the public, a person close to the
situation said. It might also seek investments from computer
software and hardware companies, and providers of entertainment and
information.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement issued Monday, the company said, ``It is
premature to speculate on the final format of this umbrella entity,
the makeup of its assets, the identity of its investors or whether
the entity will be a public company.''
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. hopes that its satellites, which already provide
television to Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, could be
used to provide high-speed data transmission as well. This would
place the satellites in competition with cable modems and digital
subscriber telephone lines, which are now starting to offer
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning off part of the satellite company to the public would
also be a way for News Corp. shareholders to realize a higher value
from the satellite holdings. The company has previously offered the
public a minority stake in Fox Entertainment, which represents the
News Corp.'s entertainment, cable and sports assets.
</P>
<P>
   Providing Internet access and other data services over satellite
is likely to become a competitive field. Hughes Electronics, the
General Motors Corp. subsidiary that owns the DirecTV satellite
television service, and rival Echostar Communications are each
planning such services, as are start-ups like Teledesic, a company
run by Craig O. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp.'s weak spot is the United States, where it does
not own satellite broadcasting operations. If it wanted to get into
the American market it might have to buy Hughes or Echostar, both
of which are very pricey because of rapid run-ups in their stock,
or one of the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   But the News Corp. hopes that by using its existing satellites
it can get a jump on the market, particularly outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. owns Star TV in Asia, a 40 percent stake in
British Sky Broadcasting, and minority stakes in Japan Sky
Broadcasting, Sky Latin America, Germany's Premiere, Italy's Stream
and Australia's Foxtel.
</P>
<P>
   All of those are expected to be included in the umbrella entity
along with the News Corp.'s 80 percent stake in NDS Group PLC, a
publicly traded pay-television technology company, and its 20
percent stake in TV Guide International, the company that will be
formed when Gemstar International Group completes its acquisition
of TV Guide. Plans for the new satellite company were first
reported in Monday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Peled, chief executive of NDS, once known as News Digital
Systems, said the company's satellites would first be used to
deliver popular Web pages at speeds of up to eight megabits per
second. Satellites can broadcast these pages to millions of users
at the same time at the same high speed, while cable modems slow
down as more people use the system. These pages could be stored on
a computer's hard disk for users to call up at their convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Early systems will not allow users to transmit to the satellite,
so consumers wanting to request a specific Web page or to send
electronic mail will still need a telephone line or cable modem.
Two-way communication with a satellite will come in a few years
with a new generation of satellites, Peled said.

ETRADE FILINGS WITH SEC OMITTED DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ETrade Group, the most visited investment site on the Internet,
has spent millions of advertising dollars to build its reputation
as a company that empowers individual investors. Along the way,
however, it has been slow to provide investors with some crucial
information about itself.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions in recent months, ETrade has excluded
information about its executives' pay packages from Securities and
Exchange Commission filings. The omissions are an apparent
violation of SEC rules, compensation experts and lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Di Chiro, an ETrade spokesman, said the company had a
strong record of disclosing information and had done nothing wrong.
One instance was ``an oversight,'' Di Chiro said, and the company
did not think it had erred in the second.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on ETrade's filings,
saying the commission did not publicly discuss specific matters.
</P>
<P>
   On the first occasion, ETrade belatedly released information on
the repricing of stock options granted to top managers. On the
second, it delayed for six months releasing the terms of a new
contract for its chief executive, Christos M. Cotsakos.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pay experts said, investors would have an unusually
hard time figuring out whether the executive pay packages would add
significantly to ETrade's losses or whether Cotsakos' contract
included a golden parachute big enough to make a future sale of the
company more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this,'' said Graef S. Crystal, an executive-pay expert
who first noticed the missing information, ``suggests these guys
are not putting the shareholders' interests before their own.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, Cotsakos agreed to a new contract. But the company
did not include details of it in its next quarterly SEC filing in
August, as the SEC requires. The company also failed to report the
contract's details in its next quarterly filing and in its annual
proxy. ``That's definitely a no-no,'' said Judith Fischer, the
publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy did mention that Cotsakos would receive a ``a special
enterprise value enhancement bonus'' if new management were to take
control of the company. But since the company did not attach a copy
of the contract to the proxy or to the earlier filings, investors
had no way to determine how big it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro said that listing Cotsakos' salary and acknowledging
the existence of the special bonus, even without discussing its
size, was sufficient for the proxy. ``The feeling here is that we
did disclose the major terms of that agreement,'' Di Chiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation lawyers, however, noted that in 601(b)(10) of
regulation S-K, the SEC specifically requires companies to attach a
copy of a new contract for top executives to the quarterly filing
after it is signed.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade has included a copy in its most recent filing, which it
sent to the SEC on Monday, and which will be available to the
public later this week, Di Chiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos, one of the highest-paid executives in the online
investment industry, made almost $10 million in the 12 months that
ended Sept. 30, including his salary, bonus and gains for exercised
stock options. He received option grants potentially worth tens of
millions of dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Cronrath Bamberger, an SEC spokeswoman, said that if the
commission determined that a company regularly left out required
information, it would consider taking action that could range from
a letter expressing concern to a fine. ``We take these filings very
seriously,'' Bamberger said. In the last two years, the SEC has
stepped up its enforcement against late filers, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The recent instances involving ETrade are particularly troubling
because of the kind of company it is, pay experts said. ETrade
deals with highly detailed SEC rules every day, and the company,
with $250 million in revenue in its last quarter, is one of the
more established Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the kind of company you'd expect to be missing
pertinent disclosures,'' said Patrick S. McGurn, a vice president
at Informational Shareholder Services, which advises institutional
investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first of the two instances, ETrade failed to include a
chart that listed the occasions in which it repriced its
executives' stock options over the last decade, as required by SEC
rules.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, ETrade repriced more than 14 million options,
many with a strike price of $6 to $7, at $4.25. At the time, the
stock was hovering around $4, having lost more than half its value
in just four months. It has grown to $21.50 since then.
</P>
<P>
   Repricing is controversial because it allows executives to
profit from options even after they have failed to reach earlier
goals. But nobody debates whether the SEC requires a company to
publish the details of its repricings from the last decade, and
ETrade's November 29 proxy did not include a repricing table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a black-letter rule,'' McGurn said. ``When you reprice,
you do the 10-year look-back table. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after publishing its proxy, the company released the
table as an addendum, correcting what Di Chiro called an oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many investors are likely to miss the information when
they research the company. Investors who rely on the actual proxy _
printing it from the SEC's online database without noticing the
addendum, for example _ will not have the table.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate-governance experts say they are concerned that
ETrade's slow disclosures are part of a general attitude among
dot-com executives that many widely accepted management practices
are not crucial. Technology companies, for example, are among the
most generous to their executives, even when they miss financial
targets. And many, including ETrade, have relatively small boards
with a high proportion of directors who have ties to management,
McGurn said.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro said that ETrade had an effective board and that the
company adhered to all SEC rules. ``It's very serious business
around here,'' he said.

GIULIANI GOES NORTH TO CRITICIZE CLINTONS ON HEATING-OIL PRICES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Soothing Republicans who complained that he had
not campaigned enough upstate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made a
hastily arranged trip here Monday to criticize Hillary Rodham
Clinton and President Clinton for their handling of rising
heating-oil prices, a pressing issue in northern New York state.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Saturday, Giuliani's aides said he had no plans
to travel north of New York City this week. But that was before
news reports quoted upstate Republican officials who insisted that
he must spend more time in the region to defeat Mrs. Clinton in the
race for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor contended that his visit, to speak to a private
meeting of Republican county chairmen and other party officials,
was aimed only at publicizing the problem of heating-oil prices and
at pressuring the Clinton administration to address it.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had called the state party chairman, Bill Powers,
during the weekend. ``I asked Bill if I could come talk to them for
a few minutes,'' he said, ``and then the fact is we knew that if we
did that, we would be able to draw a few of these cameras so that
we could get this message out.''
</P>
<P>
   But some party leaders said the visit was meant to give Giuliani
needed exposure in a region where Clinton has campaigned
extensively. They said they were placated by his appearance and by
indications that the mayor planned to get upstate more often.
``This gets him on the evening news, which is what we need,'' said
one county chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani repeated his call for the president to release oil from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to drive down the cost of home
heating oil. Oil-producing countries have cut back production,
driving up the price of gasoline and heating oil. Prices have risen
fastest in the Northeast, with suppliers' low inventories on
reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has refused to release oil from the
federal reserves, saying it should be saved for true emergencies.
But this month, the administration authorized $130 million in
federal aid to low-income people to help with their heating bills.
The largest piece of that, $34 million, went to New York.

CITY COUNCIL SAYS CIRCUS ANIMALS WELCOME IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KERY MURAKAMI  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After an emotional debate that brought tears to animal
rights activists, the Seattle City Council decided Monday that the
circus would return, and with it, elephants, bears and tigers.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-4 vote, Council members narrowly voted down a proposal to
ban ``exotic animals'' from performing in Key Arena and at other
city-owned venues.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had all the elements of a political circus: thousands
of e-mails; stories of rampaging elephants, and threats by Feld
Entertainment, which owns Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey
Circus.
</P>
<P>
   If council approved the ban, Feld Entertainment said, Seattle
would never again see the Greatest Show on Earth and other events,
such as Disney on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, council members said it came down to one question:
Is it right for humans to make animals travel around the country,
instead of allowing them to live in the wild?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe animals should be used for our
entertainment,'' said Councilwoman Judy Nicastro, a co-sponsor of
the ban. ``I love the circus. I love the clowns and the trapeze
artists. I want them to come. I don't want the animals to come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Before casting the deciding vote against the ban, Councilman
Peter Steinbrueck said: ``How we treat animals is a reflection on
our humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was uncomfortable with doing away the circus and
didn't think the general public had reached a consensus on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ban is a slippery slope,'' he said. ``There ought to be good
justification for it. It ought to be something the public
understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jan Drago said losing the circus would have meant
losing about half the family-style events planned this year for the
Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Although Drago was convinced there was a problem, she pointed
out that there had been no accidents involving circus animals here.
Others countered that circus elephants would one day cause trouble
in here.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, proponents believed a city that prides
itself on being environmentally conscious should take a
philosophical stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart that Seattle is not taking the lead,''
Nicastro said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Steinbrueck and Drago, council members Margaret Pageler,
Richard McIver and Jim Compton voted against the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Council members Nicastro, Heidi Wills, Nick Licata and Richard
Conlin voted for the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was a bruising one for some council members. Members
of the progressive Green Party, of which Steinbrueck is a member,
heavily supported the ban, and were upset that Steinbrueck voted
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason I joined the Green Party was that they were
very environmentally and socially aware,'' said Diane Venberg, a
Green Party member and coordinator of the ban campaign for the
Progressive Animal Welfare Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed he does not share those philosophies,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wills, who was seen as an establishment candidate during last
year's elections, surprised progressives for pushing the ban. But
she upset other council members when she questioned Councilman
Compton's ethics two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Compton had promised to give Wills a fifth and deciding vote to
pass the ban. But when he reconsidered, Wills said publicly that a
council member is only as good as his word, implying that his was
not so good.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Wills said, ``I acknowledge I brought the hardball
tactics of the county to City Hall. But I'm not a
go-along-to-get-along-kind-of-gal. I'm here to advocate for the
public, not to protect the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote came the same day that city supervisors in San
Francisco postponed a vote on whether to outlaw calf roping and
steer wrestling. That ordinance would bar all events that are
inhumane to animals and would require that a qualified veterinarian
be present at all rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists had hoped a ban by Seattle would set off
a domino effect that would leave traditional circuses with nowhere
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Feld Entertainment worried a victory in Seattle would
``embolden'' animal rights activists to try the ban elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people got beyond the emotional rhetoric and looked at
the facts, they realized that this ordinance was driven by
ideology,'' said Joan Galvin, vice president of Feld Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Venberg, of PAWS, said she did not know what the
group would do next.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Mayor Paul Schell, who originally proposed the
ban, said he, too, was disappointed with the Council's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to believe a ban would have been the right thing.
Nevertheless, I think the debate we've had over the past several
weeks has been good and raised people's awareness of the issue of
how we care for animals.''

EX-ATTICA INMATES RECOUNT SHATTERED LIVES AND DREAMS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Gary Haynes, Attica survivor, waited almost 30
years for this day.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a weathered suit with his mother, Betty, at his side,
Haynes showed up at the federal district courthouse here almost an
hour early Monday morning. He wanted to talk about how the guards
had beaten him and burned his chest with cigarettes. He wanted to
tell people about the kidney transplant that he says was a result
of the beating _ as well as the broken ankle, the broken feet, the
broken hip and the thwarted dreams that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance shortly after 10:30, when he rose from the
gallery, walked to the lectern and addressed Judge Michael A.
Telesca, his voice quivering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way in the world that what each of us went through
can have a monetary value,'' said Haynes, who served three years
for check forgery and is now a frail and scruffy 53. ``Is it worth
$1? Is it worth $10 million? It's been 28 years and it's time to
end. It's time to end.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Haynes became the first of 14 former inmates to offer
their opinions at a unusual hearing about last month's prisoners'
rights settlement, in which New York state agreed to pay a total of
$8 million to inmates who were tortured by guards and state
troopers after the 1971 Attica prison uprising. Forty-three people
were killed and more than 80 wounded in the four-day siege and its
suppression, the bloodiest prison uprising in the country's
history.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception, the former inmates said Monday that the
settlement, while not as generous as they would have liked, was an
acceptable way to close a painful chapter in their lives. As a
result, Telesca is expected to approve the agreement, perhaps as
early as Tuesday, and begin the formidable job of dividing the
money among the inmates, based on the injury each suffered in the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the former inmates who came out in the day's snow
and ice to speak up or just lend support to those who did, Monday's
hearing was the first time they were back in a courtroom since
being sentenced to prison, 30 years ago or more.
</P>
<P>
   The sister of one former inmate, Ernestine Felder Keeton, began
to sob, uncontrollably, while talking about her younger brother,
Gregory, who had been serving time in Attica for robbery. He died
of cancer six years ago at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard a whole bunch of people speak at one time,'' she
said. ``I thought Gregory was making some of this up. My brother
would run through the house screaming or hiding under the bed,
thinking that someone would be after him. My kids thought we lived
in the prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing was all the more unusual as an unexpected
reunion, since many of the former inmates had not seen each other
since the siege three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1971, inmates at the Attica Correctional Facility,
about 30 miles east of Buffalo, seized control of parts of the
prison and took many of the guards hostage as a way of protesting
poor medical care, unsanitary conditions and the lack of other
basic services. When negotiations stalled, Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller ordered the state police to retake Prison Yard D.
Troopers used helicopters, dropped tear gas and fired
indiscriminately at a crowd of more than 1,200 inmates in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   After the troopers had regained control, law enforcement
authorities and prison guards committed brutal acts of reprisal,
forcing inmates to crawl naked over broken glass and denying basic
medical care to the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, lawyers representing 1,281 inmates filed a
$2.8 billion class-action lawsuit against prison and state
officials. But it took 18 years before the suit came to trial, and
five more to reach the damages phase _ delays that the inmates'
lawyers and a federal judge later said were the fault of a lower
court judge and the state.
</P>
<P>
   In January, though, at the urging of Telesca, the parties agreed
to the proposed settlement, which provides $8 million for inmates
and $4 million in lawyers' fees and does not require the defendants
to admit liability or wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of just how sensitive the Attica case remains,
Telesca felt compelled to clarify several matters Monday morning.
He said that although he sympathized with calls from a growing
number of people to offer additional benefits to the relatives of
the 11 guards who were killed, he emphasized that the settlement,
by law, could deal only with the inmates' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Telesca also said that only those inmates who were injured
during the siege would be eligible for the settlement. They will
have until July 7 to fill out a questionnaire, then will be
interviewed individually, if need be, by the judge, to determine
how much money each should receive.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates' lawyers, some of whom have worked on the case for
all their careers, expect that perhaps 500 former and current
inmates, most of whom are middle-aged or elderly now, will file
claims, and that the $8 million should be divided up by year's end.

EDITORIAL: ALBANY'S SNOOZING LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Now that a federal court has blocked attempts to keep Sen. John
McCain off the ballot in New York's March 7 presidential primary,
the state's top lawmakers need to turn their attention to permanent
reform of New York's insane presidential ballot rules. So far only
one Albany leadership figure, the State Senate's Democratic
minority leader, Martin Connor, has shown any interest in this
vital project. The real powers in the capital _ Gov. George Pataki;
Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader; and Sheldon Silver, the
Assembly speaker _ are demonstrating a collective failure of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Connor introduced a measure that would lift New York
into the ranks of such recognized democracies as Connecticut and
California. Under Connor's legislation, Senate Bill 6482, the
executive director of the State Board of Elections would put on the
ballot all ``nationally known and recognized candidates'' who wish
to appear. Delegates would be apportioned based on the popular vote
for the candidates in each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Connor has gotten things rolling in the right
direction, Pataki has a special obligation to help repair New
York's reputation. Along with State Republican Party apparatchiks,
he tried to rig the primary for Gov. George W. Bush _
notwithstanding the court's rejection of a similar attempt to limit
the primary ballot for former Sen. Bob Dole in 1996. But Pataki
seems becalmed when it comes to the subject of changing the state's
unfair election laws. His press office says that having failed to
fix the state's presidential primary system during six years in
office, the governor feels he can wait an additional four years
until he has to address the issue. It's odd that Pataki, who labors
so hard to look progressive on other issues, wants to look like a
machine pol on this one.
</P>
<P>
   Also puzzling is Sheldon Silver's refusal of the mantle of
progressive leadership. As the Legislature's most powerful
Democrat, he should lead on voting rights and ballot access. But
instead of joining with Connor, Silver is hunkered down like
Pataki. The speaker sent word through his press secretary that he
``doesn't want to rush into anything.'' How long, one wonders, does
Silver need to ponder a proposition that was pretty well settled by
the American Revolution? Hey, let people vote!
</P>
<P>
   As for Bruno, he reacted to Connor's bill by going into partisan
attack mode, allowing his spokesman to say that the majority leader
does not take his lead from Senate Democrats. He also said that
Connor, an election lawyer, would be a more credible spokesman for
ballot reform if he gave up representing private clients in fights
over petitions and other ballot matters.
</P>
<P>
   The point about Connor's outside legal practice is well taken.
But it does not detract from the obvious merit of his proposal to
put New York's battalions of ballot-blocking lawyers out of work.
If Bruno is unhappy about following Connor's leadership on this
issue, he has the votes to take over the crusade. The current
Pataki-Silver-Bruno strategy of immobilization cannot repair the
state's democracy.

A STERLING EXAMPLE OF INCOMPETENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers, who typically reach
midseason form on the opening day of training camp, have mushed
into the NBA's official intermission at a gaudy 11-38.
</P>
<P>
   It's high time to make peace with the consequences:
</P>
<P>
   __ Chris Ford is a goner.
</P>
<P>
   __ Derek Anderson looks like a goner.
</P>
<P>
   __ Maurice Taylor sounds like a goner.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rookie Lamar Odom is in a funk.
</P>
<P>
   So let's gang up and blame owner Donald T. Sterling. He put his
foot down (several times) to secure Ford's hiring in January of
1999. He took the low (payroll) road when his personnel experts
wanted to hire a playing veteran or two as spotters for their
certifiable young hotshots.
</P>
<P>
   But before placing all of the responsibility for this stinker on
Sterling's doorstep, let's first take a few swings at his
co-conspirators. It's possible to suggest Sterling is getting what
he's paying for, but it might be hard to believe the man hasn't
been slightly ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   The sideline leadership has been the equivalent of putting a
Universal Studios tour guide in charge of open-heart surgery. The
on-court execution has been torture on witnesses. The fraternity
spirit of training camp has morphed into a ball-hogging bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   For irony, let's hark back to October, 1999 . . . Week 1 at Camp
Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have Clipper Syndrome,'' Taylor said between sworn
oaths to leave via free agency because Sterling didn't offer to
extend his contract to the tune of $70.9 million over six years.
``Most of us haven't been here that long.''
</P>
<P>
   With 20 defeats in their last 22 games, it might be time to
notify the next of kin: Clipper Syndrome is heavy upon the land.
Looks terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Let's grade the symptoms:
</P>
<P>
   __ Power forward: We start with Taylor, who's quick to say he's
having a career year. Fans are quick to notice the lack of
offensive flow when ``Mo'' gets the ball. Taylor is averaging a
team-leading and career-high 17.5 points per game, but his board
work (6.6, also a career best) ranks last among the league's
noteworthy power forwards in rebounds-per-minute. __ Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   __ Small forward: Odom has freaky skills at 6-foot-10 but lacks
the emotional skill at age 20 to avoid looking miserable while the
beating goes on. He averages 16.6 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.7
assists nice numbers that have been harpooned by an 8.6 scoring
average over six games this month. Odom is a scrapper when it's
time to play, but his midrange game requires the after-hours work
he has yet to put in. __ Grade: B-minus
</P>
<P>
   __ Center: If judged as the No. 1 pick in the 1998 NBA Draft,
Michael Olowokandi (9.6 points, 8.5 rebounds, 45 percent from the
field) could be considered a bust. If defined by his progress
through just six seasons in semi-organized basketball, he would be
rated inconsistent. If Olowokandi ever learns to defend without
inviting referees to pick on him, and play with more passion than
confusion, he'll be a solid NBA post man for many years. __ Grade:
D-plus.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shooting guard: Free-agent-to-be Anderson (16.8 points)
publicly insists he'll consider returning to the Clippers. For this
notion to even approach reality, Sterling must be convinced to pay
about $50 million for seven years. Meanwhile, Anderson's interest
in sharing the ball has decreased in (perhaps) coincidental
proportion to the increase in losses. __ Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   __ Point guard: Injury-cursed Eric Murdock is a wily veteran in
Wile E. Coyote's body. Troy Hudson is a shooting guard (38 percent
from the field, 30 percent on 3-pointers) in a point guard's body.
As a playmaker, Hudson's report card should read ``Pass? Fail.'' __
Grade: F-plus
</P>
<P>
   __ Bench: Rating this contribution seems unfair, because
injuries have eliminated the Clippers from achieving any near-depth
experience. Strongman Brian Skinner has missed 23 games (ankle),
and bad health for the starters Taylor (9 games, foot/flu/hand),
Anderson (11 games, concussion/ankle) and Murdock (10 games, knee,
ankle) has wrecked the bench continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth man Tyrone Nesby earned a three-year contract by doing his
own stunts (example: defense) last season as an undrafted rookie.
This season, ``Nez'' seems to think he's ex-Clipper Lamond Murray.
The latter, who now plays for Cleveland, doesn't even play like
Lamond Murray anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Closs and Charles Jones survived camp against the wishes
of Ford, who subsequently required desperate situations to actually
put either of them in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Piatkowski has missed 62 percent of his field-goal
attempts. Anthony Avent is that nice guy who plays defense at
practice. __ Grade: D-minus.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaching: Ford's trusted assistant, Jim Todd, now has the
console, backed by ex-Celtics star Dennis Johnson, who used to be
Ford's trusted assistant in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Todd is a splendid person who is adored by his players but
probably not enough for them actually to pass the ball and play
convincing defense for an entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson could be head-coaching material but doesn't seem like
the type to step in front of Todd to prove he fits this profile.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Rex Kalamian is a tireless worker, hip to NBA
X's and O's and might be the best shooter in the organization. __
Grade: F (for Ford and fired)
</P>
<P>
   __ Ownership: Sterling is a model of consistency. __ Grade:
Incomplete.

UNTANGLING COMPLEX SCHEMES IN DEATH OF SOCIALITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mother and son accused of murdering an Upper East
Side millionaire devised a scheme to steal her town house with so
many details that they were eventually tripped up by the complexity
of the scheme, prosecutors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan by the mother and son, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, to
steal Irene Silverman's $10 million home and then kill her included
the use of 30 false names, three fake offers of Caribbean
vacations, and a well-used stolen credit card, the lead prosecutor,
Connie Fernandez, said in her opening statement in the Kimeses'
murder trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their arrogance and greed overcame their common sense,'' said
Fernandez, an assistant Manhattan district attorney. ``They left a
trail of bread crumbs, so to speak, for police to follow, from
California to Las Vegas, from Las Vegas to Florida, from Florida to
New York City and to Irene Silverman's home.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Kimeses made their way through Manhattan, Fernandez said,
they tried to trick people into helping them seize control of
Silverman's East 65th Street mansion. They tried to persuade two
bankers to alter a check, two notaries public to certify a forged
deed, one of Silverman's employees to reveal a Social Security
number, and another person to give up a parking space, Fernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, a widowed socialite, was 82 when she was last seen by
an assistant on July 5, 1998, a day after she told friends that she
planned to evict Kenneth Kimes from a $6,000-a-month apartment in
the town house that he had rented under a false name, Fernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the assistant left Silverman alone in her
room, the prosecutor added, the Kimeses killed her, put her body in
a duffel bag and disposed of it in an effort to buy enough time to
finish gaining control of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe she is dead,'' Fernandez said. ``We believe they
murdered her and that they did it to get her out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's body has never been found. But prosecutors said
dozens of spiral-bound notebooks filled with writings by the
Kimeses provided the outline and evidence of their scheme to steal
the mansion. The notebooks, the prosecution said, contain a list of
information the Kimeses needed about Silverman, detailed schedules
of her domestic staff and notes about New York's complex real
estate laws.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kimes, 24, grew pale as he listened to the prosecutors'
opening argument, in stark contrast to his demeanor a few hours
earlier, when he was laughing with his lawyer. Sante Kimes, 65, who
has given up her dyed black hair, wide-brimmed hats and dark
glasses for gray hair, a pantsuit and half-glass spectacles, looked
equally sober, and at one point halted her almost incessant note
taking, the same habit that prosecutors contend will seal her fate.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is to give its opening statement Tuesday. An
84-count indictment accuses the Kimeses of second-degree murder,
robbery, conspiracy, fraud, weapons possession, larceny and
eavesdropping, among other charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice Rena K. Uviller, who is presiding over the case, has
issued an order prohibiting the lawyers from discussing specifics
of the case. But Mel A. Sachs, Kenneth Kimes' lawyer, said: ``This
case should be based on the evidence and the lack of evidence. The
jury should consider the quality, not the quantity, of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez recited for jurors the first names of at least a dozen
of the 125 prosecution witnesses they are to hear from. Among the
most important may be the assistant, identified only as Aracellis,
who last saw Silverman and who Fernandez said took three suspicious
calls at Silverman's home on the day of the socialite's
disappearance _ two from Kenneth Kimes and one from a person
apparently disguising his or her voice.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said the Kimeses had made those calls to learn where
Aracellis was and what she knew, and to try to persuade her to
leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will also rely on the testimony of Stanley
Patterson, who they say was summoned to New York by Sante Kimes to
take over the town house, fire the staff, change the locks and
evict the tenants. But Patterson was an informant for the FBI and
tipped off investigators. After he and Sante Kimes met,
investigators arrested the Kimeses on a Utah warrant accusing them
of buying a car with a bad check.
</P>
<P>
   Inside that car, Fernandez said, investigators found a gun,
ammunition, syringes, a powerful sedative, disguises, a page of
stolen Social Security numbers and some of the Kimeses' notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Because Silverman's body has not been found, the evidence from
the car, along with the fake deed, will be crucial. But despite the
lack of a body, Fernandez told jurors, the prosecution would have
no trouble proving that Silverman was murdered and did not simply
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would also show that Silverman would never
have sold her house. ``She was a sharp businesswoman,'' Fernandez
said. ``She knew what she wanted and she knew what she didn't.''

MAN ARRESTED WITH MISSILE GUIDANCE GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The federal authorities here have arrested a man
they say was trying to leave the country with military technology
used in missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   In an 18-page affidavit filed Monday in federal court here,
officials said the man, Jeffrey Jhyfang Lo, had told undercover
agents that the device, an infrared thermal imaging camera, was to
be used by the Chinese government on missile and reconnaissance
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Lo was taken into custody by U.S. Customs officials late
Saturday at Los Angeles International Airport as he was about to
board a China Airlines flight to Wuhan, China.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found the camera and two lenses in his luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit filed Monday said that Lo had bought the camera
from an undercover FBI agent working in a defense contracting
company in Santa Barbara, Calif., paying $5,000 in cash and
$137,000 in a cashier's check.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the case was not immediately clear, and Thom
Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office here, said the
technology might have a legitimate commercial application outside
its military use. Prosecutors were still researching the legalities
of exporting the device, Mrozek said.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, Lo is said to have requested that a
representative of Chinese State Shipbuilding Corp. be allowed to
visit the defense contracting company to negotiate the purchase of
38 additional cameras. The corporation has been identified in the
Cox Report, an assessment of China's efforts to obtain American
technology, as one of China's largest institutions dedicated to the
application of technology to China's military. The company's
headquarters is in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is described by law-enforcement authorities as
equipment used to track missiles and in satellite reconnaissance.
The cameras produce images like those of American missiles hitting
Iraqi targets that were made public during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Export of the camera requires registration with the State
Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls.

EDITORIAL: THE TRUTH ABOUT CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a powerful nudge from President Clinton, the secrecy
that has too long shrouded Washington's role in the 1973 political
convulsions in Chile is lifting. The picture painted by newly
disclosed passages from State Department papers is profoundly
disturbing. It is now clear that the American government knew far
more about the disappearance and murder of two American citizens in
Chile than it acknowledged at the time. Indeed, American
intelligence and military officials may have encouraged Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's security forces to round them up even though it
was clear that the two men, like thousands of Chileans arrested
during the same period, were likely to be mistreated, if not
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about clandestine American activities in the Cold War
has been difficult to unearth and painful to confront. In the name
of opposing Communism, Washington sometimes ignored its own
democratic principles and condoned the kind of brutal conduct it
publicly deplored. The case of the two Americans murdered in Chile
seems to belong in this category.
</P>
<P>
   For 26 years, American officials have steadfastly denied any
role in the unsolved murders of the two young men in September
1973. Charles Horman, 31, a filmmaker and writer, and his
colleague, Frank Teruggi, 24, were arrested and killed as
supporters of General Pinochet overthrew the Socialist government
of Salvador Allende. Horman and Teruggi applauded Allende's
Socialist experiments. They worked for a newsletter that reprinted
articles from American newspapers critical of American policy
toward Chile. Their deaths were dramatized _ and American
complicity strongly implied _ in the 1982 movie ``Missing,'' made
by Constantin Costa-Gavras.
</P>
<P>
   The recently declassified State Department documents show that
its own investigators concluded almost immediately after the
murders that Pinochet's new government had killed the two men. The
investigators inferred, moreover, that the Chileans would not have
done so without some sign of assent from American intelligence
officials.
</P>
<P>
   This damning information was not made public when portions of
the same documents were selectively declassified in 1980. The State
Department cited national security and executive privilege
considerations in exempting the passages from disclosure under the
Freedom of Information Act. The reasoning was deceptive, and an
abuse of the law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has pressed for full disclosure of Cold
War secrets, directed federal agencies to search their files for
information on human rights abuses and terrorism in Chile,
beginning with the period from 1968 to 1978. Clinton acted after
the arrest of Pinochet in London in 1998 on human rights charges
filed by a Spanish Judge. It is now time for the CIA and the
Pentagon to follow Clinton's order, and the example of openness set
by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

ALASKA DEFENDS MECHANICS' DECISION NOT TO REPLACE PART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alaska Airlines said its mechanics did exactly what
they were supposed to two years ago when they decided not to
replace a key part of the stabilizer control system on the plane
that crashed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The part _ a large nut that runs up and down a jackscrew to move
the stabilizer wing atop the tail _ was initially believed to be in
need of replacement. But it was left in place after it was tested
several times and determined to be well within the wear limits set
by Boeing, Alaska Airlines officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the multiple re-checks of the jackscrew and gimbal nut
assembly found it to be within specifications, no action was
necessary under Boeing's maintenance manual, which is approved by
the FAA,'' Alaska said in a statement on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Questions are being raised about Alaska's maintenance work after
the National Transportation Safety Board disclosed Sunday night
that mechanics at the airline's heavy maintenance facility in
Oakland, Calif., decided in 1997 to replace the nut, then changed
their minds the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect a badly worn jackscrew assembly led to the
Jan. 31 crash of Alaska Flight 261. All 88 people on the jet died.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's 40-foot horizontal stabilizer, which controls the
airplane's tendency to pitch up and down in flight, is known to
have jammed 12 minutes before the crash, sending the plane into an
initial dive of more than a mile from its cruising altitude of
31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots regained control of the jet and flew for another nine
minutes before a second and much more violent dive _ still
unexplained _ sent the plane plunging into the ocean from 18,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   During a heavy maintenance check on the plane on Sept. 29, 1997,
mechanics performed a test to determine the looseness of the
8-inch-deep nut. This is known as an ``end play'' check. The nut is
kept still and mechanics see how far the jackscrew can wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   The initial examination of the jackscrew and nut assembly
indicated that the endplay of the jackscrew was .040 of an inch,
within limits prescribed by Boeing, Alaska officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing instructs mechanics to ``Check that endplay limits are
between .003 and .040 inch. Readings in excess of above are cause
for replacement of acme jackscrew and nut.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's instructions also state that the measurement should be
repeated several times to ensure consistent results, Alaska said.
So mechanics the next day re-tested the nut and found the endplay
was .033. Five more checks showed the nut was within standards,
Alaska said.
</P>
<P>
   An airline spokesman said the nut and jackscrew assembly would
have been checked for wear again in about 30 months.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's statement does not explain why mechanics initially
decided to replace the nut before doing additional tests.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation consultant C.O. Miller, a former NTSB senior
investigator, said Monday he has questions about why mechanics
changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always suspicious of paperwork,'' he said. ``You can get a
much different understanding of what happened once you talk with
the mechanics ... and investigators will certainly be doing just
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators, among other things, will want to know if
replacing the nut would have delayed returning the plane to
service.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators reportedly are exploring a theory that the
nut was so badly worn before the crash that it was able to slip
freely up and down the jackscrew, which works much like an electric
garage door opener.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer was jammed in its full up position, which was
pushing the nose of the plane down with such force that it likely
took the efforts of both pilots pulling on their control columns to
keep the plane's nose up.
</P>
<P>
   If the stabilizer suddenly deflected further, past mechanical
stops because the nut slipped up the jackscrew, that might explain
the plane's violent fatal dive, aviation experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from the FAA, airlines Friday began a visual
inspection of the jackscrew assembly in about 1,100 planes _ the
entire U.S. fleet of MD-80s, MD-90s, their predecessor, the DC-9,
and a newer derivative, the Boeing 717 (formerly the MD-95). The
deadline to complete those inspections was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency also gave airlines 30 days to measure wear in
the jackscrew assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, U.S. had airlines reported 23 planes with
``positive findings,'' ranging from metallic grit in the jackscrew
grease, which may be a sign of normal wear, to shavings, which are
not, said FAA spokesman Less Dorr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to speculate on what the results mean because
there is no pattern, at least none that has been found,'' Dorr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines performed the test for wear at the same time
mechanics made the visual inspection.
</P>
<P>
   At least two planes, one at Delta and one at AirTran, failed the
test that measured the nut and jackscrew assembly for wear.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrews were replaced in a number of planes after the
inspections, Dorr said. They are now in the hands of either the FAA
or the safety board and all will be examined.
</P>
<P>
   No problems have been found in 29 C-9 aircraft operated by the
Navy and Marine Corps, said Navy spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth
Zimmermann. The C-9 is the military version of the DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   Dorr gave this breakdown of what has so far been reported to the
FAA by the airlines:
</P>
<P>
   _ Airborne Express, 75 planes: Two jackscrews needing
lubrication.
</P>
<P>
   _ AirTran, 44 planes: Two had grit in the jackscrew grease, one
failed the wear check. All three jackscrews replaced. All were
DC-9s, and none of AirTrans' nine new Boeing 717s had problems, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alaska Airlines, 34 planes: Eight were found to have metal
shavings on or around the jackscrew. Four jackscrews replaced,
others being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   _ American Airlines, 284 planes: One jackscrew lacked lubricant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Continental Airlines, 69 planes: One plane had grit in the
jackscrew grease. The part was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delta Air Lines, 136 planes: Four problems found, including
the one that failed the wear test. That plane's jackscrew assembly
was replaced. Two planes had grit in the assembly. One had metal
shavings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hawaiian Airlines, 15 planes: Two had shavings in the grease.
Both jackscrews replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest Airlines, 172 planes: One found with grit in the
grease. The jackscrew was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ TWA, 131 planes. One plane with with metal shavings. The
jackscrew was replaced.

COMMENTARY: SHIFTING POLITICS OF THE CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republicans began this election cycle with a conciliatory
tone on race, hoping to attract support from members of the black
middle class, many of whom fit the GOP profile but were put off by
the race-baiting and Willie Hortonizing that dominated Republican
politics during the 1980s. George W. Bush seemed to be reaching out
to black voters early on, when he took his message of inclusion and
``compassionate conservatism'' into African-American communities
that had rarely seen Republican candidates in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans have reverted to old tactics in South
Carolina, where the two leading presidential candidates have hedged
their bets for the Feb. 19 primary by supporting the right of South
Carolinians to fly the Confederate battle flag over the State
Capitol, despite the flag's association with segregation and the Ku
Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   This compromise with bigotry has proved convenient for the
candidates at this moment. But it could also stimulate the black
vote across the Deep South in the general election, threatening the
Republican grip on Congress and aiding the Democratic attempt to
keep control of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the traditional states'-rights approach in South
Carolina, arguing from the start that the issue of whether to keep
the flag rested with South Carolinians themselves. But Sen. John
McCain took one side and then the other, saying at first that the
flag was ``offensive'' and a ``symbol of racism and slavery,'' then
reversing himself, saying that it was defensible to fly the flag
over the capitol because it symbolized Southern honor in battle. In
truth, the Confederate battle flag as we know it today has little
to do with the glories of the Civil War and everything to do with
the backlash against civil rights that eventually made the flag a
symbol of choice among neo-Nazis, skinheads and other bigots.
</P>
<P>
   In the years immediately following the Civil War, the
Confederate battle flag was not an omnipresent symbol in the South.
But around the time of Jefferson Davis' death in 1889 there was a
blossoming of ``lost cause'' nostalgia, and the flag emerged as an
icon of defiance and racism.
</P>
<P>
   The flag returned to popularity in the 1890s just as the former
Confederacy was stripping blacks of the rights to vote and hold
political office, which they had briefly enjoyed just after the
Civil War. The flag had begun its transformation from an emblem of
a dead cause to a symbol of resistance to Reconstruction and civil
rights and, later, to an emblem associated with night riders and
vigilante terrorists. By the mid-20th century the battle flag had
been fully appropriated by the Klan and other extremists, who
displayed it at cross-burnings and lynchings and to show resistance
to black demands for civil rights and equal treatment under the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Apologists in South Carolina say that the flag was hoisted over
the capitol for the centennial of the Civil War, then mistakenly
left flying. In truth, the flag went up in 1962, a full year after
the centennial. State officials were in a dispute with the Kennedy
administration, which had urged the integration of the Charleston,
S.C., hotel where a centennial convention was being held. When
South Carolina refused to admit black delegates to the hotel, the
convention was moved to a nearby military base.
</P>
<P>
   The flag's appearance a year later was an implicit endorsement
of segregation _ and the premise that black citizens were unworthy
of sharing public accommodations with whites. South Carolina's
present governor, Jim Hodges, tacitly acknowledged this negative
symbolism in this year's State of the State Message, when he
implored the legislature to remove the flag, reminding it that
``the entire nation is watching and listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous presidential campaigns, the flag issue in South
Carolina came and went quickly with little fanfare or lasting
impact. This year's dust-up brought a demonstration by civil rights
activists that included nearly 50,000 people, followed by the
threat of an economic boycott against the state. In a development
that should shame both Bush and McCain, a group of former state
legislators who were serving while the flag went up recanted the
decision and urged the current legislature to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   The flag will eventually come down, making South Carolina the
final state to put it away. By failing to take a strong position
now, the GOP has missed an easy opportunity to distance itself from
offensive racial politics and to build the beginnings of a bridge
to the black electorate. In the quest to wring every possible white
vote out of South Carolina, Bush and McCain have identified their
party yet again with forces that have poisoned our national
politics for more than 100 years.

BUSH ADVISER, YEARS AGO, HELPED DRAFT A PUSH POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add sentence to final graf re McCain campaign.)  
(lb) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has expressed outrage
at the accusation from the McCain camp that his campaign is
involved in the controversial political technique known as push
polling, in which workers posing as pollsters spread negative
charges about a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has threatened to fire any campaign staff member involved
with push polls.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996 in Texas, however, Karl Rove, Bush's longtime
political adviser and the chief architect of his presidential
campaign, helped draft a push poll, financed by the tobacco
industry, that was used in an effort to thwart a planned state
lawsuit against the tobacco companies. At the time, Rove was both a
top consultant to Bush and a $3,000-a-month consultant to Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the 1996 push poll was the attorney general of
Texas, Dan Morales, a Democrat. At the time, Morales was preparing
to file a lawsuit against several tobacco companies to seek
reimbursement for billions of dollars that the state had spent on
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Morales, who is no longer attorney
general, said the pollsters had used negative and false information
about his record in an effort to sway the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the survey shows that it included more than a dozen
negative statements about Morales' record as attorney general.
Morales says the poll distorted his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said that the results, which showed that most Texans
rated a tobacco lawsuit as a low priority, were shared with him by
a Philip Morris lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to use the results of this poll to intimidate me
into not filing the lawsuit,'' Morales said. ``I was not surprised
by the effort. But it was somewhat disconcerting to see the dual
role that Rove was playing, as chief Philip Morris lobbyist for
Texas while he was the chief political consultant to the governor
of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Morales filed the lawsuit against the tobacco
companies. And in January 1998, the industry settled the lawsuit
with the state of Texas for $15 billion, a figure that was
eventually increased to $17.3 billion, including $2.3 billion in
fees to the five lawyers and firms for the plaintiffs. Bush took no
position on the merits of the lawsuit, but after the settlement he
called the fees awarded to plaintiffs' attorneys ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said:
``Mr. Rove's role was only to review a fifth draft of a survey that
had been written by someone else and to suggest that a copy be
shared with the attorney general. That was the extent of his
role.''
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition conducted in 1997, Rove acknowledged that he had
offered suggestions about the poll's questions and demographics and
recommended that a copy of the results be provided to Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Rove was a consultant to Philip Morris from 1991 to December
1996. He said he ended his representation of Philip Morris in
December 1996, in part to avoid bringing controversy to Bush. But
from January 1995 to December 1996, the two jobs overlapped.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of push polling erupted in South Carolina last week as
a bitterly divisive issue between the McCain and Bush campaigns. It
began when a distraught woman told Sen. John McCain that her
teen-age son had taken a call from a pollster who portrayed McCain
as a ``cheat and a liar and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush angrily denied that the call came from one of his pollsters
and has released the scripts used by some of them to prove that his
campaign is not spreading falsehoods about McCain. Some Bush
operatives have privately pointed fingers at McCain's advisers for
past client work that involved push polls.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Rove said that after the poll was conducted,
he delivered a copy to Joe Allbaugh, an executive assistant to Bush
and now his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said that Allbaugh did not give the document to Bush but
instead ``put it in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco push poll was conducted by Public Opinion
Strategies, an Alexandria, Va., firm. Neil Newhouse, a partner at
the firm, did not return calls Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morales said that in the push poll that Rove helped draft, his
positions on an array of issues, including gun control and
affirmative action, were mischaracterized. And he said respondents
had been influenced by the false information. ``They said
conservative groups rated me as a left-leaning, liberal Democrat,
which is simply not true,'' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Opinion Strategies summarized its findings this way:
``The lawsuit is opposed by a strong majority of Texans, and they
express skepticism over the motives of the attorney general on the
issue. Dan Morales is in good shape politically, but he has some
areas of softness, and others of outright vulnerability. The lack
of support for the lawsuit _ especially since it is being filed by
private lawyers who stand to gain after contributing to the
attorney general's campaign _ is a clear vulnerability for the
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales did not seek re-election in 1998.
</P>

FIRST SUIT FILED IN ALASKA AIR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LEWIS KAMB and JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Second-guesses started even as investigators began pulling
debris and bodies from the Pacific's cool waters to piece together
the final moments of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   The flight crew was aware of mechanical problems in the
aircraft's stabilizer. They knew, too, that their airplane was
within landing range of several airports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they chose to continue flying toward their next scheduled
stop, San Francisco, even as they discussed the stabilizer problem
for at least a half hour with Alaska personnel on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, aviation experts, bolstered by hindsight,
quietly and reluctantly started questioning the crew's decision to
trouble-shoot rather than touch down.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pilot would ever jeopardize his passengers just to make a
flight schedule,'' said Bill Waldock, associate administrator of
the Center for Aerospace Safety and Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, though, it probably would have been better to
put the plane down sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Monday the quiet ponderings gave way to loud allegations of
negligence as a Chicago-based lawyer, representing the family of a
marketing executive lost in 261's fatal dive, filed what is
believed to be the first lawsuit stemming from the Jan. 31 crash.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers and in a telephone interview, aviation litigator
Robert Clifford contended the ill-fated jetliner was in range of at
least nine commercial or military airports where its pilot could
have landed and potentially averted disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clifford said, the flight crew grappled for several
minutes to control and correct the faltering aircraft _ a decision
that proved fatal for 88 people when the plane plummeted into the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, hell, why didn't they land in San Diego?'' Clifford
asked Monday. ``They were in an emergency situation and instead of
landing they were trouble-shooting in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board, Alaska Airlines officials declined comment on the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska spokesman Lou Cancelmi said details of the plane's flight
plan, which included contingencies for landing at alternative sites
in case of emergency, were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know if there are nine different airports in
that area or not, but because of the investigation, we can't really
comment on that right now,'' Cancelmi said.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83's stabilizer problems apparently began not long after
the plane took off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. It was in the air
some two hours and forty minutes before it crashed, and aviation
experts say the pilots must have been aware of problems because
they flew manually for most of the trip, rather than use the
autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is moved or trimmed to keep the plane's nose from
pitching up or down. When a plane is properly trimmed, the pilots
don't need to push or pull on the control columns to keep the plane
stable.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder indicates the stabilizer was
never trimmed in the nose-up position during the cruise portion of
the flight, which experts say would have been highly unusual. On a
typical commercial flight, as many as 75 or more trim changes are
made to keep a plane stable.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was well past Los Angeles when the balky stabilizer
suddenly jammed and the plane dove about 7,000 feet from its
cruising altitude before the crew could regain control.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the pilots had been talking with Alaska personnel on
the ground about the stabilizer problem for at least 19 minutes,
based on a review of the 31-minutes of tape on the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   A jammed stabilizer is rare but not unheard of _ pilots are
trained to land with the plane in that condition.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts and airline pilots are reluctant to
second-guess the experienced crew of Flight 261. They point out
that Capt. Ted Thompson and First Officer William Tansky would have
had no way of knowing that a stabilizer problem they thought they
could manage would suddenly turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   But as the investigation into the cause of the crash continues
to unfold, some experts have questioned whether the pilots should
have spent as much time as they did attempting to troubleshoot the
problem, rather than simply land as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how serious a problem did the crew think they
had?'' Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   Very serious, according to lawyer Clifford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply should have landed at the first signs of
trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, names Alaska
Airlines and aircraft manufacturers McDonnell Douglas and Boeing as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Brought on behalf of Julie Friedmann, 42, of Round Lake Beach,
Ill., wife of Allen M. Friedmann, 48, who perished in the crash,
the lawsuit seeks more than $75,000 in damages for herself and her
husband's three children, Brett, 20; Rachel, 17, and Jonah, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from claims that the airline's flight crew should
immediately have landed the plane at the first sign of trouble, the
nine-page lawsuit alleges that McDonnell Douglas, which
manufactured the plane, and Boeing, which later bought McDonnell
Douglas and its assets, are negligent for improperly assembling and
servicing the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford said Monday that he represents family members of four
other Fight 261 victims who also intend to sue. The firms that made
the plane's parts also will likely be named as defendants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clifford, Dan Gellert, a retired Eastern Airlines pilot who
lives in Sequim, contends the crew should have landed sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were already by Los Angeles and still playing with the
trim system,'' he said. ``They should have landed the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, two Alaska Airlines pilots interviewed for this story
said it is wrong to second-guess Thompson and Tansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't possibly know what kinds of problems they were trying
to deal with,'' one said. Neither wanted their names used.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of stabilizer problems and the decision-making
response of the flight crew will be the focus of a lot of attention
in this investigation,'' said Waldock, who has assisted various
agencies in crash investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question that will need to be answered is `when do you
deal with a problem in the air and when do you decide just to go
ahead and land the plane as soon as possible?' ''

HOSTILE CHORUS PUNCTUATES TESTIMONY IN DIALLO TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The hooting started around the time Sean Carroll
said he had become a police officer because he was raised to help
people. For the busload of people who had come from New York City
to the overflow courtroom in the Albany County courthouse, where
the trial can be seen daily on closed-circuit television, that
answer was only one of many that strained credulity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liar,'' one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When does he get his Academy Award?'' a man asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told better lies to my mother,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   When Carroll choked up as he was asked about the fatal shooting
of his friend Officer Kevin Gillespie, the room rocked with
disdain. ``Unh unnhhh,'' people called out. A few hissed.
</P>
<P>
   When Carroll said he had seen Diallo ``slink back'' into the
vestibule, there were grunts of outrage. When Carroll said he and
Officer Edward McMellon had clearly identified themselves as
police, there were guffaws of skepticism. And when Carroll said
Diallo ``just didn't want to listen,'' a chorus of heys and ohhhs
rose up in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quiet,'' court officers barked, not for the first time. ``If
you can't control yourself, you're going to have to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Court officers said they were under orders to run the overflow
room like a regular courtroom. But one said: ``You try to be a
little understanding. You have to understand that people are going
to get emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the overflow room was the Rev. Calvin Butts. He
said he was struck by Carroll's ``sense of arrogance,'' and that he
doubted several aspects of the officer's testimony, particularly
when he said he could not tell from down the street that Diallo was
black.
</P>
<P>
   Also there was Abdul El-Amin, 59, who had come from Manhattan on
his day off from his security job. ``Policemen have been getting
away with murder for years,'' El-Amin said. Then he turned back to
the screen, where Don Levin was beginning his cross-examination of
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, prosecutors,'' El-Amin said, ``earn your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Diallo's shooting, Police Department officials and
Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer who was hired through the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association and now represents McMellon, said that the
officers were hunting for a serial rapist that night and thought
Diallo resembled ``in a generic way'' the sketch of the rapist.
</P>
<P>
   That account of the officers' assignment that night was repeated
countless times in news articles.
</P>
<P>
   But the story raised some eyebrows, both because people in the
neighborhood said they had not been warned of the rapist's
existence, and because the man arrested and accused of the rapes
two months later, Issaac Jones, 38, bore little facial resemblance
to Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Carroll did indeed bring up the rapist, saying that
the officers were regularly given new intelligence reports about
him and had a sketch of him with them that night. Before
encountering Diallo, he said, he and his fellow officers had
fruitlessly pursued a man at the Bronx River Houses who fit the
rapist's description.
</P>
<P>
   The rapist was supposed to be a male Hispanic or, more likely,
black, between 5 feet 5 inches and 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing
between 130 and 150 pounds. He used either a small black gun or a
small silver handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Upon seeing Diallo, Carroll said, he thought, ``He definitely
resembles the description of the rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was 5 feet 6 inches and weighed 150 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But on cross-examination, Carroll was shown a sketch of the
rapist that he was carrying the night Diallo was shot, and conceded
that it bore ``minimal resemblance'' to Diallo. He also conceded
that the last rape by the suspect in the 43rd Precinct had been in
March 1998, almost a year before the shooting. (Prosecutors said
afterward that it was actually January '98.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he suggested that from down the street, the
officers could not determine that Diallo was black. And he said he
had a ``hunch'' that Diallo was a lookout for a push-in robber.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll did point out that there were several composite sketches
of the rapist produced by the Police Department. But one that has
been widely circulated, because it does slightly resemble Diallo's
face, is dated Feb. 14, 1999, 10 days after the shooting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether the four officers were the proxies for or victims of
their department's policies is an issue that both the prosecution
and the defense have danced around in the trial. All were members
of the Street Crime Unit, and as Carroll said Monday, in the 1990s
the unit's attention turned to getting illegal guns off the street.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the unit's work then became stopping and frisking young
men, most of whom were blacks and Hispanics. Sometimes, but not
always, it was because a bulge in their clothes or furtive
movements suggested they might be carrying guns. Although the unit
was given a lot of the credit for reducing violent crime in New
York City, much of the outcry after Diallo's death focused on the
way innocent people had been caught up in those searches.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Levin, who was cross-examining the officers, tried to
capitalize on that backlash, repeatedly asking the officers about
``stop-and-frisks'' in a tone that sounded as if he were talking
about people who rob Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   He got Carroll and McMellon to concede that most of the people
they thought had guns turned out to have been carrying ``innocuous
objects, like wallets or beepers.'' Diallo was found to have only a
wallet and a beeper after he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   And Levin tried to get them to say that only about 10 percent of
all the stops they make result in arrests. But both officers would
concede only that they did not arrest most of those they frisked.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also focused on a stop they made earlier in the evening
for which they failed to file paperwork. He said that meant there
would have been no accountability if they had violated the rights
of the person they had stopped. And he implied that perhaps the
officers had performed other stop-and-frisks that night for which
they also had filed no reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting here under oath I don't remember any other
stop-and-frisk,'' McMellon said. ``It was a very trying night for
us.''

KANSAS CITY SAYS GOODBYE TO DERRICK THOMAS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Moments past noon Monday at Arrowhead
Stadium, a sleek B-2 stealth bomber glided overhead, slipping
across the sky like a huge, flat and thin shiny silver coin. Below,
in a gold coffin in one of the end zones, lay the body of Derrick
Thomas, No. 58, the great Kansas City Chiefs linebacker who died of
a blood clot last Tuesday, 16 days after an auto accident had left
him paralyzed from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Chiefs fans sitting in the stands applauded the
majestic tribute to a man whose father was an Air Force pilot who
never returned from Vietnam. On the field, several members of the
Chiefs organization awaited the arrival of Thomas' family from one
of the stadium tunnels. Edith Morgan, his mother, led a group of
more than 20 family members toward the tent that covered the
coffin. She was rolled forward in a wheelchair, too weak to walk,
too numb to speak. The group formed a half circle around the
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of Thomas' brothers, 20-year-old Jay Morgan, walked
toward the middle of the field, his eyes locked on the big screen
high above that projected Thomas in his Chiefs uniform, smiling,
seemingly peering down on them all. Morgan squatted squarely in the
center of the field with his head in his hands and remained there
until his relatives embraced him and coaxed him to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the reality of all of this, it was too much,'' Morgan
said later, explaining his own special midfield tribute. ``I was
just sitting there thinking: `I'm right where my brother played.
This is it.' I talked to Derrick twice while he was in the
hospital, including the day before he died. We talked about me
moving from tight end to defensive end at my college, Jones Junior
College, in Laurel, Miss. Derrick was happy about that and my
grades. I just told him we needed him to get well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded me that the key to winning football at my position
was that the lowest man wins. `Get low and you can blow them off
the ball,' he said. That's what he did all of the time. I was in
class when my teammates came and got me and told me that he had
died. The whole family now, we just keep telling each other that
God doesn't make mistakes and to just believe.''
</P>
<P>
   On this Valentine's Day, when more than 20,000 came to the
stadium to view Thomas in an open coffin in a procession that
lasted all day, everyone tried persuading others to just believe.
To believe that Thomas' life _ cut short at age 33 _ was a life
worth celebrating as much as mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``So young, but he lived a good life,'' said Lamar Hunt, the
Chiefs' owner, who stood on the field and tried comforting the
Thomas family. ``I've seen messages from Denver fans and Raiders
fans, our biggest rivals, who said they still hate the Chiefs but
spoke with so much respect and sympathy. I was at the AFC
championship game when I got the news that Derrick had been in the
accident. And then for those few days he seemed to be in good
spirits and there was hope that he would one day walk again. And
then this. It is harder because it was totally unexpected. This
outpouring of affection here today is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could remember a professional football player having such
a tribute, on the field, the coffin open for fans, who waited in
long lines that descended the stadium steps for a glimpse of their
hero. A private service at a local church was scheduled for the
evening and another service on Tuesday morning at Kemper Arena was
planned. Attendees were to include former Chiefs Joe Montana and
Marcus Allen, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Hank Williams
Jr., who planned a musical tribute.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, a day that began with dark and cloudy skies but
ended in bright sunshine, was especially for the people of Kansas
City. It was for the Chiefs' cavalry of fans who had watched Thomas
arrive here from the University of Alabama in 1989 and play 11
seasons, nine of them as a Pro Bowl player.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Brown, 43, of nearby Lee Summit, Mo., said he took the day
off from his delivery job to pay his respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here Tuesday night, Wednesday, Friday and today,'' said
Brown, who wore a red Chiefs jacket, a white Chiefs cap and a
yellow button that featured a red No. 58. Everyone entering the
stadium Monday received one of those buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respected Derrick as a man, a young man who did great work
on the field and great charity here off of it,'' Brown said. ``He
was taken away from us so early. He brought so much excitement
here. When I looked at him in that casket, I tell you, it looked
like to me he was smiling. If anyone looks at those tributes to
Derrick out in front of the stadium, that will tell them everything
they need to know about what Kansas City thinks of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on a 20-yard stretch of lawn under a tent in front of
Arrowhead, there is now a shrine left by Chiefs fans _ balloons and
flowers, posters and pictures, stuffed animals and footballs,
banners and newspaper clippings, T-shirts and hats, poems and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Dan and Kelly Boyd took their 2-year-old son, Dan Jr. ``We
wanted our son to see this, even if he doesn't always remember it,
because this is a part of our history,'' Kelly Boyd said. ``I felt
OK until I actually saw Derrick. Seeing his body, I was moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Boyd said: ``I did not know Derrick Thomas. But I watched
him for the last 11 years play Chiefs football, and seeing him on
TV in our living room meant he was like a part of my family. My son
is going to grow up and play football. I hope he becomes a player
and a man like Derrick Thomas.''

WOMAN WHO LOST HOME TO $58 BILL WILL GET IT BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ A Rockland County woman who lost her town
house to foreclosure because of a missed $58 tax payment and a
whole lot of red tape will get it back under an agreement reached
Monday with the county government and the man who bought the
foreclosed house.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Mireille Leroy, 38, of Spring Valley, had never been
late with a mortgage payment and first learned that her $114,000
home had been foreclosed upon and sold at auction when she was
served with an eviction notice by the new owner on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Her mortgage holder was responsible for paying her taxes and had
done so, except for one $58 installment that the county Tax
Department had not notified it about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very relieved and thankful,'' Leroy said in a statement.
``No one should ever have to go through what I went through here. I
wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan negotiated by Ryan S. Karben, a Rockland county
legislator and chairman of the Tax Delinquency Committee, the
county will seek to have the state Supreme Court void the
foreclosure. Then the county will reimburse Carlo Jean Pierre, the
man who bought the tidy brown-shingled town house for $60,000 at a
county auction as an investment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Norwest Mortgage, the bank that held the mortgage
on the property and was responsible for paying Leroy's property
taxes out of an escrow fund, will pay Jean Pierre $15,000 for the
mistake. Community groups will also chip in to pay the roughly
$2,000 in legal bills accumulated by Leroy, a single mother and
registered nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Karben has also proposed legislation, which is expected to be
called ``Mireille's Law,'' that would require a county worker to
visit all homes threatened with foreclosure for tax delinquency.
``This is a testament to the neighborly spirit of Rockland
County,'' Karben said.

TONY BETTENHAUSEN, 48, YOUNGEST BROTHER IN AUTO RACING FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Lee Bettenhausen, a member of a prominent auto racing
family who owned a racing team and once drove Indy Cars, died
Monday in a plane crash on a farm near Leesburg, Ky. He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, which occurred midday about 30 miles from Lexington,
Ky., also killed Bettenhausen's wife, Shirley, the daughter of the
longtime Indy Car driver Jim McElreath; Russ Roberts, a partner in
Bettenhausen's racing team; and Larry Rangel, a businessman from
Indiana, according to Brad Stevens, a spokesman for the
Indianapolis-based Bettenhausen Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off from Tri-City Airport in Blountville, Tenn.,
and was on the way to Indianapolis, the Federal Aviation
Administration said. Bettenhausen was returning home from
Homestead, Fla., where he had been involved in testing for the
Championship Auto Racing Teams circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a twin-engine Beech Baron belonging to
Bettenhausen, according to a report by the Speedvision cable
television network. It was not immediately clear whether he was
flying the plane, but he had a pilot's license, according to the
network. The cause of the crash was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Bettenhausen was the youngest of three racing brothers and the
son of Melvin Eugene (Tony) Bettenhausen, a two-time national
champion who was killed during a practice run for the Indianapolis
500 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Lee Bettenhausen drove Indy Cars from 1979 to 1993 and
raced 11 times in the Indy 500. He had 103 career starts in Indy
Cars with a best finish of second and was the U.S. Auto Club rookie
of the year in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He earned $2.4 million in his driving career, and his CART team
earned nearly $6 million in prize money with 13 different drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Bettenhausen began his career racing stock cars in 1969, joined
the Winston Cup circuit in 1974 and competed in the U.S. Auto Club
stock and midget divisions in 1975 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   His father raced at the Indianapolis 500 from 1946 to 1960. The
elder Tony Bettenhausen was killed while taking a practice run at
Indy as a favor to another driver, Paul Russo, who felt that
something was wrong with his car and asked if Bettenhausen could
discover the problem. While Bettenhausen was driving that car on
the main straightaway, a 5-cent pin in the steering system came
loose. The car hit a wall, soared high in the air, crashed and
burned, killing Bettenhausen instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Lee Bettenhausen's brother Gary was a well-known race car
driver. Another brother, Merle, lost his right arm in a wreck in
July 1972 at Michigan International Speedway, racing in the
Michigan 200.

RICHARD MCCORMICK, THEOLOGIAN, DIES AT 77
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard A. McCormick, for many years the dominant
American voice in Roman Catholic moral theology, especially on the
daunting questions of medical ethics that have emerged in recent
times, died on Saturday. He was 77 and lived at the Colombiere
Center in Clarkston, Mich., a residence of the Society of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, said the Rev. Richard McBrien, a close
friend and colleague at the University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, who was the John A. O'Brien professor of Christian
ethics at Notre Dame until last year, influenced the public and
several generations of Catholic theologians with his magisterial
grasp of the fine distinctions and painstaking arguments that
Catholic moral theology developed over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated the relevance of this tradition to biomedical
problems like in vitro fertilization, surrogate motherhood,
abortion, euthanasia, gene therapy, access to medical care and
patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   While vigorously representing Catholic moral teachings in public
debates, where he was viewed as a conservative on abortion and
euthanasia, McCormick questioned some of the tradition's absolute
norms _ particularly in regard to contraception, sterilization and
other sexual and reproductive issues _ in ways that drew opposition
from some conservative Catholic theologians and Vatican officials.
</P>
<P>
   A section of Pope John Paul II's 1993 encyclical ``Veritatis
Splendor'' (``The Splendor of Truth'') rejected an approach to
moral reasoning known as ``proportionalism,'' with which McCormick
was associated. McCormick contended the document had misrepresented
proportionalists, none of whom would recognize themselves, he said,
in the encyclical's description.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the place of ``conscientious dissent'' in the
church, provided it followed an effort to assimilate official
teachings, a process he said ``must be prayerful, arduous,
reflective, informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the annual convention of the Catholic Theological
Society of America featured a debate about theological dissent
between McCormick and the Rev. Avery Dulles, a fellow Jesuit and an
elder statesman of American Catholic theology.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCormick had a minor stroke while traveling to
Lourdes, France, he postponed an operation on an occluded artery to
participate in the debate. When the surgery did take place, in late
June, it resulted in another stroke that left McCormick paralyzed
and unable to read or write but clear of mind and able to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesuit weekly, America, once described McCormick as almost
``genetically destined for a career in medical ethics.'' He was
born in Toledo, Ohio, in October 1922, the son of a physician who
served a term as president of the American Medical Association.
Ordained a priest in 1953, McCormick completed his doctoral studies
four years later in Rome. He had joined the Jesuit order in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an enormous influence on Catholic moral theology in the
whole world,'' said the Rev. Charles E. Curran, who co-edited 11
volumes of readings in moral theology with McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   That influence began with the ``Notes on Moral Theology,'' a
regular survey tracking publications in English, German, French,
Spanish and Italian, which McCormick wrote from 1965 to 1984 for
the scholarly journal Theological Studies. He described and
evaluated an enormous body of current thinking on issues that
included divorce and remarriage and nuclear deterrence, as well as
bioethical topics like experimentation on humans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, after 16 years of teaching moral theology to Jesuit
seminarians, he became the Rose F. Kennedy professor of Christian
ethics at the Kennedy Center for Bioethics at Georgetown
University. He joined the faculty at Notre Dame in 1986. He was a
member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and president
of the Catholic Theological Society of America in 1969-70.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his scholarly books and articles, McCormick wrote for a
general readership in Catholic journals like America and
Commonweal, on the op-ed pages of The New York Times and The
Washington Post, and even in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the few public theologians in the Catholic
church,'' McBrien said. ``He made himself available to the press
and television, he lectured before all kinds of audiences, he
mediated the conclusions of scholarship to a wider public.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, McCormick never tried to construct a major
theological synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a large-scale systems builder,'' said Daniel
Callahan, the co-founder and former president of the Hastings
Center, a research center on biomedical problems where McCormick
had been a fellow. ``Instead, he did a lot of very careful, very
specific articles pushing forward the frontiers of ethics in a
methodical way.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick was known for his unpretentiousness and his pastoral
instincts. Sidney Callahan, a clinical psychologist and author who
is married to Daniel Callahan, recalled being stunned by a lecture
the priest gave and telling him afterwards, ``You know, Dick,
you're such a nice guy that I forget how smart you are.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick is survived by three sisters, Carol Sala of Pepper
Pike, Ohio, and Kathleen Brooks and Mary Jo Anderson of Toledo.

FIRST SUIT FILED IN ALASKA AIR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LEWIS KAMB and JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Second-guesses started even as investigators began pulling
debris and bodies from the Pacific's cool waters to piece together
the final moments of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   The flight crew was aware of mechanical problems in the
aircraft's stabilizer. They knew, too, that their airplane was
within landing range of several airports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they chose to continue flying toward their next scheduled
stop, San Francisco, even as they discussed the stabilizer problem
for at least a half hour with Alaska personnel on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, aviation experts, bolstered by hindsight,
quietly and reluctantly started questioning the crew's decision to
trouble-shoot rather than touch down.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pilot would ever jeopardize his passengers just to make a
flight schedule,'' said Bill Waldock, associate administrator of
the Center for Aerospace Safety and Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, though, it probably would have been better to
put the plane down sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Monday the quiet ponderings gave way to loud allegations of
negligence as a Chicago-based lawyer, representing the family of a
marketing executive lost in 261's fatal dive, filed what is
believed to be the first lawsuit stemming from the Jan. 31 crash.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers and in a telephone interview, aviation litigator
Robert Clifford contended the ill-fated jetliner was in range of at
least nine commercial or military airports where its pilot could
have landed and potentially averted disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clifford said, the flight crew grappled for several
minutes to control and correct the faltering aircraft _ a decision
that proved fatal for 88 people when the plane plummeted into the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, hell, why didn't they land in San Diego?'' Clifford
asked Monday. ``They were in an emergency situation and instead of
landing they were trouble-shooting in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board, Alaska Airlines officials declined comment on the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska spokesman Lou Cancelmi said details of the plane's flight
plan, which included contingencies for landing at alternative sites
in case of emergency, were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know if there are nine different airports in
that area or not, but because of the investigation, we can't really
comment on that right now,'' Cancelmi said.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83's stabilizer problems apparently began not long after
the plane took off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. It was in the air
some two hours and forty minutes before it crashed, and aviation
experts say the pilots must have been aware of problems because
they flew manually for most of the trip, rather than use the
autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is moved or trimmed to keep the plane's nose from
pitching up or down. When a plane is properly trimmed, the pilots
don't need to push or pull on the control columns to keep the plane
stable.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder indicates the stabilizer was
never trimmed in the nose-up position during the cruise portion of
the flight, which experts say would have been highly unusual. On a
typical commercial flight, as many as 75 or more trim changes are
made to keep a plane stable.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was well past Los Angeles when the balky stabilizer
suddenly jammed and the plane dove about 7,000 feet from its
cruising altitude before the crew could regain control.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the pilots had been talking with Alaska personnel on
the ground about the stabilizer problem for at least 19 minutes,
based on a review of the 31-minutes of tape on the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   A jammed stabilizer is rare but not unheard of _ pilots are
trained to land with the plane in that condition.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts and airline pilots are reluctant to
second-guess the experienced crew of Flight 261. They point out
that Capt. Ted Thompson and First Officer William Tansky would have
had no way of knowing that a stabilizer problem they thought they
could manage would suddenly turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   But as the investigation into the cause of the crash continues
to unfold, some experts have questioned whether the pilots should
have spent as much time as they did attempting to troubleshoot the
problem, rather than simply land as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how serious a problem did the crew think they
had?'' Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   Very serious, according to lawyer Clifford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply should have landed at the first signs of
trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, names Alaska
Airlines and aircraft manufacturers McDonnell Douglas and Boeing as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Brought on behalf of Julie Friedmann, 42, of Round Lake Beach,
Ill., wife of Allen M. Friedmann, 48, who perished in the crash,
the lawsuit seeks more than $75,000 in damages for herself and her
husband's three children, Brett, 20; Rachel, 17, and Jonah, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from claims that the airline's flight crew should
immediately have landed the plane at the first sign of trouble, the
nine-page lawsuit alleges that McDonnell Douglas, which
manufactured the plane, and Boeing, which later bought McDonnell
Douglas and its assets, are negligent for improperly assembling and
servicing the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford said Monday that he represents family members of four
other Fight 261 victims who also intend to sue. The firms that made
the plane's parts also will likely be named as defendants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clifford, Dan Gellert, a retired Eastern Airlines pilot who
lives in Sequim, contends the crew should have landed sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were already by Los Angeles and still playing with the
trim system,'' he said. ``They should have landed the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, two Alaska Airlines pilots interviewed for this story
said it is wrong to second-guess Thompson and Tansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't possibly know what kinds of problems they were trying
to deal with,'' one said. Neither wanted their names used.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of stabilizer problems and the decision-making
response of the flight crew will be the focus of a lot of attention
in this investigation,'' said Waldock, who has assisted various
agencies in crash investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question that will need to be answered is `when do you
deal with a problem in the air and when do you decide just to go
ahead and land the plane as soon as possible?' ''
