   Only Sampras left &QL; 
to carry U.S. flag
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBEDON, England _ ``How does it feel,'' the sad-faced British
sportswriter asked Wednesday, ``to be in a country that's in
mourning?''
</P>
<P>
   Being a compassionate person, I expressed my proper condolences
for England's demise on a penalty shootout in the World Cup. But it
wouldn't be until much later in the day before I could honestly
feel the man's pain. When Venus Williams went down kicking and
screaming _ mostly the latter _ at Wimbledon, the massacre was
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterfinal round began with three American women still
competing for tennis' most prized title and ended with every one of
them out on their uh, ears. While I doubt the entire U.S.
population went into a big funk over this, a certain U.S.
television network with tailfeathers probably has as much empathy
with how down the English fans are today.
</P>
<P>
   As the headline in the Daily Mirror screamed, ``IT'S JUST TOO
CRUEL TO TAKE.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacock gang needn't break into sobs, though. At least
Pistol Pete Sampras lives to fire again, as opposed to our
yanked-out Yank lassies. Sampras' bid to establish himself as the
most accomplished player in the history of men's tennis continues.
His outslugging Mark Philippoussis left him two match victories shy
of his fifth Wimbledon title, which would then leave him trailing
only Roy Emerson in career Grand Slams won. But to claim his 11th,
tying him with Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg behind Emmo's 12, he must
go through Britain's Tim Henman on Friday. Yikes. I don't know how
the Brits will react if their Tim follows their Lions down the
tube, Sampras or no Sampras opposite him. They might do something
really drastic, like overthrow the monarchy or endorse the Euro.
Has an entire kingdom ever been put under a suicide watch?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to see here
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of overthrows, that's pretty much what happened among
the women. We could have had Monica Seles vs. Lindsay Davenport in
one of the semis today, sending an American _ albeit a naturalized
one in Seles' case _ to Centre Court on the Fourth of July.
Instead, we've got Natasha Zvereva vs. Nathalie Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   That's two players who define the term journeywoman.
</P>
<P>
   That's also TV ratings as in dead.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Jana Novotna, the queen of England's also-rans, and you
have 39 prior Wimbledons they've played fruitlessly, although
Novotna has made two finals, blowing both.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, who first came to Wimbledon in 1984 when the defending
champion, 17-year-old Martina Hingis, was 3, had never advanced
beyond the quarters in her first 42 Grand Slams. Guess 43's a
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva? Her last venture this deep into a major a decade ago as
a finalist in the French Open opposite Steffi Graf ended with her
incurring the most lopsided thrashing ever in a final Slam dance,
male or female, since the Open Era began.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the weather is supposed to stay dicey through the
weekend. Henman by his lonesome is left to salvage this most dreary
of fortnights for the Brits. But ditto Sampras for us in the
Colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, Williams and Seles all appeared on track for
breakthroughs. That none could even manage the semis is somewhat
astounding, particularly given the pedigrees of those who did _
save, of course, for Mighty Miss Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely story
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva possessed gaudy doubles credentials, but she began the
tournament a combined 0-21 against Graf and Seles in singles play.
John McEnroe said it reminded him of the late Vitas Gerulaitis, who
upon finally defeating Bjorn Borg after 17 consecutive losses to
the Swede, said: ``Listen, nobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 18 times
in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Zvereva is 2-21 against them, having taken out Seles after
bouncing Graf, a rare tournament double accomplished before only by
Zina Garrison here in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At least Tauziat, a Wimbledon quarterfinalist in 1992 and again
last year, is considered a grass-court diva of minor note despite
having roots deep in French clay. Asked if she thought she would
put a 6-3, 6-3 pounding on a woman, Davenport, ranked No. 2 in the
world, Tauziat appeared miffed by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``On grass, yes,'' Tauziat replied coldly.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna obviously held a huge experience advantage over
Williams, but Venus is such a promising talent that her reputation
greatly exceeds her rsum.
</P>
<P>
   Any time now, we expect her to blow by everyone, Hingis
included, and take control of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, she couldn't even control her emotions.
Three line calls made her go crazy (she was right about one of
them) to the point that she began screeching at the chair umpire:
``I know it's out. She knows it's out. Everyone knows it's out. But
you don't know it's out.''
</P>
<P>
   We've never seen Williams behave thusly before. She sounded like
all of England _ and NBC _ must have felt.

FRUHWIRTH PACKS BIG PUNCH HEADING INTO WOMEN'S OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, Amy Fruhwirth would have been a long shot at best to
win the U.S. Women's Open on a treacherous course such as the one
being used this week for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwolf Run, with fairways and greens that weave their way
through the thick forests near Kohler, Wis., would have eaten her
alive.
</P>
<P>
   But Fruhwirth, who once upon a time was golf's version of Little
Red Riding Hood, is packing a new weapon these days that keeps the
big, bad wolf at bay. It's called a PING TiSI driver, and she never
leaves home without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made a huge difference in my game,'' said the 5-foot-2
Fruhwirth, a former Arizona State All-American who lives in
Scottsdale. ``Last year, I was averaging about 210 yards (off the
tee), whereas this year, I'm in the 220 to 230 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having to hit a 3-wood into the long par 4s, I'm
hitting a 7-wood. At other times, I'm getting to hit a 5-iron
instead of the 7-(wood). Everything is shorter with a lot more
loft. It's just really changed everything, because most of that
yardage with the driver is carry, not roll, something you have to
have when you're playing out here.''
</P>
<P>
   That partially explains why Fruhwirth, who has been on the LPGA
Tour for six years, finally broke through two weeks ago, making the
Friendly's Classic her first professional victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all unexpected,'' admitted Fruhwirth, 29, who always
has had a brilliant short game. ``I didn't think I'd ever win out
here because I'd been hoping it would happen for so long, and when
it didn't . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration set in. Despite ``good years'' in 1996 and '97, when
she finished 30th and 37th on the money list, this season had been
just so-so: one top-10 finish in Tucson and an 11th at the Dinah
Shore. In the previous six tournaments before her win, she made
only two cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting down on myself,'' said Fruhwirth, who many felt
didn't have the length off the tee as a pro to match her success in
college, when she won the 1991 U.S. Amateur and '92 U.S. Public
Links championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like I was snap-hooking everything and getting in
all kinds of trouble. Just subtle things kept leading to a lot of
bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally said, `Don't be so hard on yourself.' I was fully
prepared to write this season off and go on, and then just when I
least expected it . . . the unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 1998 has been a year to remember for Fruhwirth, and not
just because the $90,000 check she earned at the Friendly's nearly
tripled her biggest payday ever. She also got married in January to
Paul Hornung.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of changes,'' she said of the union to Hornung, who just
happens to work for Phoenix-based Karsten Manufacturing, makers of
that PING driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, it's more difficult being on the road than I
thought. I really miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's good news, she said. ``He's flying in (today), and
I'm really psyched to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fruhwirth said she'll need all the help she can get because
Blackwolf Run is extremely long (6,412 yards, par 71).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four par 4s that are difficult to reach in
two (strokes),'' she said. ``Plus, the greens are big and
undulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think that even-par will be a great score. Maybe
even the winning score.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for the new PING driver, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that I'm getting more distance, I'm also hitting
it very accurately,'' said Fruhwirth, who is leading the tour in
driving accuracy by hitting 82 percent of her fairways. ``The
combination of the new (titanium) head and the new (grafalloy)
shaft have been a perfect fit for for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fruhwirth said she originally had another shaft in the driver,
but that a switch has proved dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that most amateurs don't realize, how
important the shaft is,'' said ``Giggles,'' whose nickname comes
from a happy-go-lucky attitude that sometimes is plagued by
nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take 20 shafts and the same head, and just one of
those shafts might fit just right. It can make all the difference
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the new driver, plus her success in past U.S. Golf
Association-sponsored events, allow her to compete against the
likes of Open favorite Annika Sorenstam this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver will definitely help, but the Open is so different
(than the Amateur or Publinks) because of the format (stroke vs.
match play),'' she said. ``I'm going to have to be at the top of my
game and really chip and putt well.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Perhaps the ``other Open'' even helped her in a
roundabout way, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win is the best feeling in the world, even though it's a
relief more than anything,'' she said. ``At the same time, I've
been able to take (the victory) in stride because there wasn't
really a lot of attention focused on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the same weekend of the men's (U.S.) Open, so there
was no TV or real media attention on me winning. It kept me
grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until she gets home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's going to be fun,'' she said of her triumphant
return to the Valley. ``I guess there are a lot of cards waiting
for me, and a lot of people are real excited. That's probably when
the win is really going to hit me.'' &QL;

MERCURY GETS BIG LIFT FROM AGELESS GILLOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Gillom thought she'd forgotten what she learned all
those years ago in Abbeville, a town of 500 tucked into
northwestern Mississippi, an hour's drive from Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there was much she retained. Such as the values that
had been drilled into her by her mother, Ella Ree Gillom; her older
brothers, who replaced the father who died when she was 3; and the
extended congregation at the Providence United Methodist Church.
And the hearty smile and laugh that draw children to her like some
sort of Pied Piper.
</P>
<P>
   But what seemed to have escaped Gillom soon after she left
Abbeville for stardom 12 miles up the road at the University of
Mississippi in Oxford were the one-on-one basketball moves
practiced, hour after hour, on a dirt court in a pasture with her
nine siblings and especially her cousin, Terry Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, she enjoyed a successful four years at Ole Miss _
earning Southeastern Conference female Athlete of the Year in
1985-86 and ranking second to her sister, Peggie, in career
scoring. But those who enjoy watching Gillom play today _ flashing
across the lane like a 6-foot-3 land-to-air missile; executing a
picture-perfect baseline fade; feeling the pressure of her younger
and taller opposition, then spinning past it; spotting up for a
three-pointer _ might not have recognized her in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to do those moves all the time when I was little,'' she
recalled. ``We would get out there at least three or four hours a
day, just practicing on different moves, counting down the clock,
different things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I'd forgotten it when I was in college, but then
it's like it just all came back to me, those days when we used to
watch the NBA and just practice on the dirt court. It's like it's
all coming back to me late in life, which I can't understand
because I had it all the time, but I just didn't use it. Now it
seems like it's come back.''
</P>
<P>
   What the WNBA and Mercury are seeing is Gillom playing like a
34-year-old kid. A decade after she won an Olympic gold medal and
12 years after she and her Mercury coach, Cheryl Miller, were U.S.
teammates during the summer of 1986, she is averaging 15.9 points,
fifth best in the league through Tuesday. &QL; 
`I feel like I'm 24' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I'm 34. I feel like I'm 24,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me like I'm getting better with age, like the wine
deal. That's totally shocking to me. It's like I'm in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe after all these years I'm able to keep up
with that same performance. I think perseverance is the key word
here. I used to just go out and play. Now I think about what I need
to do before a game. I prepare myself better. The main thing I can
say is I've been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed never to have been seriously injured, unlike Miller, who
is only five months her senior but whose knees essentially gave out
after 1986, ending a Hall of Fame playing career.
</P>
<P>
   Miller jokingly blames her premature retirement as a player on
Gillom, retelling a story from their teammate days in Moscow that
nearly rocks the accused to the floor in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing on our (1986 World Championship) team was to try
to see who you could scare to death,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, it was truly Big Jen, she was a ``big'' girl. I
slipped under her bed, waiting for her to come in, and as soon as
she was halfway asleep jump out and scare her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sleeping on cots, so when she laid down, the cot came
all the way underneath, and she pinned me. Finally I started
moaning, and that's when she started screaming. That's exactly what
ended my career, Jen laying on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom said, ``I had no idea she was under there. All of a
sudden I saw this hand come from under my bed, and I just started
screaming and running. But I got her back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so we get the rest of the story, though it was not
volunteered by Miller.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Gillom organized a middle-of-the-night raid with the
co-conspirators, including 6-8 Anne Donovan, dressing in long
hooded raincoats and painting their faces white with facial cream.
``We had candles in our hands, surrounded Cheryl's bed and tapped
her on the foot,'' Gillom said. ``She just freaked out. I got her
really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller doesn't hold a grudge. She remains one of Gillom's
biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jen is the same today as she was 80 years ago,'' she said.
``Just soft-spoken, great personality, silent leader, quick to
encourage, quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the many players I'm so glad this league came for
when it did, because they did more than just put in their time.'' &QL; 
Praise from college coach &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her college coach, Van Chancellor, now directing the WNBA
champion Houston Comets, recalls a game against Louisiana Tech when
Gillom had 26 points and 16 rebounds but drew his ire for poor
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I thought about what a poor statement that was on my
part, I called her up to the front (of the bus) and apologized,''
Chancellor said. He asked her why she quietly took his harsh
comments. ``She said you were the coach and you were right, I
didn't guard anybody. I'm just telling you what a wonderful person
and easily coachable person she is.''
</P>
<P>
   After college, Italy became a first home of sorts for Gillom.
She spent two-thirds of the year there from 1987 to '96, making a
living and praying for her country to turn on to the women's game
before it was too late for her to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom and many of the 1986 U.S. teammates won a Pan American
Games gold medal in 1987 and the Olympic gold in '88. But mostly
they toiled in obscurity overseas, seeing the world but not being
seen by those who mattered most to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe going overseas helped me to get mentally tough,'' said
Gillom, who also played a season in Greece before the first year of
the WNBA and cashed in her All-WNBA second-team credentials for a
six-figure salary in Turkey during the most recent off-season. ``I
can see where that has been a factor in my career. All of the
issues I had to go through, it says a lot. It helps you to grow and
to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   When the WNBA made its first player allocations in January 1997,
the Mercury was assigned Australian point guard Michele Timms and
Gillom, a forward. Both have lived up to their cornerstone
expectations, leading Phoenix to the Western Conference title last
year and triggering a much deeper team to a 6-2 start this season
heading into today's 4 p.m. game in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing with Jen, especially when we get the two-man
game going really well together,'' Timms said. ``She never ceases
to amaze me how she can score that big bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially because Gillom has never been known as much of a
practice player.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes to practice, but she likes to practice by getting
out there on her own and doing what she wants to do,'' said Peggie
Gillom, who recruited Jennifer to follow her at the University of
Mississippi and helped to coach her there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had her, she was never good in practice, but my God,
when the lights come on, that's what counts for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Timms said, ``When she crosses the white line, she's
superwoman.'' &QL; 
Playing tougher defense &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gillom's statistics are slightly better in the first quarter of
this season than last year, especially rebounding (6.4 average) and
steals (1.75), where she's in the league's top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's playing defense this year,'' Timms said. ``I know the
goal in Jen's head is to be the MVP, and to do that she's got to
play at both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not individual honors that drive Gillom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never looked at myself as a star, and I still don't,'' she
said. ``That's what kept me humble, to continue to dream, to
continue to get better and better. A lot of people get satisfied
with themselves at a younger age. I've never been like that.'' &QL;

MACHINES TO SELL CARDINALS TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ZUCKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The Cardinals announced plans Wednesday to begin
distributing tickets through the ETM Entertainment Network, ending
their 10-year partnership with Dillard's ticket outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for all 10 home games this season will go on sale Monday
and can be purchased at ETM ticket machines located at selected
Safeway stores, over the phone or via ETM's website. The ETM ticket
machines operate like a bank automatic teller machine and
distribute tickets through self-service kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think fans are going to be excited about having ticket
outlets much closer to their homes,'' said Michael Bidwill,
Cardinals vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill said the advanced technology and convenience associated
with the ETM machines made the company a logical choice to take
over the ticket distribution. The machines utilize a touch screen
that allows fans to specify the game, seat location and price of
tickets they are interested in, and can complete the average
transaction in less thn a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Fans wishing to buy their tickets the old-fashioned way still
can do so by calling ETM at (888) 386-8497. Those connected to the
Internet can purchase tickets at www.etm.com on the World Wide Web.
Whether purchased over the phone or the Internet, all tickets can
be picked up via the ``will call'' feature of the ETM kiosks at the
fans' convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are also available at the Cardinals ticket office in
Tempe, 8701 S. Hardy Drive, and at Sun Devil Stadium on game days.
</P>
<P>
   There is no maximum number of tickets that can be purchased by
one person at the machines, but Bidwill said only eight may be
bought per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are expected to announce 1998 season ticket
figures by Monday, just as single-game tickets go on sale. The team
will once again offer a ``FlexPack'' ticket plan in which fans can
buy tickets for the same seats to three games. &QL;

SHEFFIELD PULLS ALL-STAR REVERSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One day and one impassioned meeting with
general manager Tom Lasorda later, Gary Sheffield agreed to
represent the Dodgers at Tuesday's All-Star Game in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield originally planned to spend the three-day break in
Tampa, Fla., with his family, whom he hasn't seen since spring
training. He was acquired May 15 in the Mike Piazza trade with
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But Lasorda spoke to Sheffield before Wednesday's 7-5 Dodgers
victory and convinced him that the club wanted him there _ for the
National League, and his own reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, ask the boss,'' said Sheffield, who was named to
his fourth All-Star team. ``We talked and I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lasorda's appeal to Sheffield was that this is the right
fielder's first year with the struggling club. Sheffield is in the
first season of a six-year, $66 million contract that includes $5
million to compensate for tax differences between Florida and
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you what I told him,'' Lasorda said.
``If I wanted you to know what I said, I would have left the door
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda provided one concession for Sheffield, who was selected
by Jim Leyland, his former Marlins manager. Sheffield will fly in
the day of the game and not have to attend Monday's workout, which
is All-Star policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers called the National League and the request was
approved. Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. also will not attend the
workout.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Sheffield returns to Los Angeles but will not
have to participate in Wednesday's workout at Dodger Stadium. The
season resumes Thursday at home against the division-leading San
Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   One for two: Lasorda wasn't quite so successful convincing Eric
Young to go on the disabled list after the second baseman strained
his right thigh muscle for the third time in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said Tuesday he was placing Young on the DL and calling
up minor-league infielder Joey Cora. Trainers said Wednesday
Young's condition had improved, and Young was not pleased with
Lasorda's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the NL leader with 32 stolen bases, will miss five games,
then use the three-game All-Star break to rest the leg. Young has
missed a total of 10 starts at second, including six straight from
June 18-24.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi understands: Unlike Sheffield, Raul Mondesi wanted to
the go to the All-Star Game. He leads the team with 18 homers and
is batting .390 (14 for 36) in his last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who made the NL All-Star team in 1995, will spend the
break in his native Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great time, but that's OK,'' he said. ``To me, I am an
All-Star. That's the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hit: Matt Luke started in left and had a double in two
at-bats. But he was ejected in the fourth for arguing with
home-plate umpire Rich Garcia after getting thrown out at the
plate. Replays showed Luke was not tagged by Rangers catcher Ivan
Rodriguez.

ANGLERS HEAD FOR HILLS  
 ENJOY COOL JULY 4, BUT DON'T EXPECT GREAT FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   FOREST LAKES, ARIZ. _ The days have become uncomfortably warm at
times on the Mogollon Rim, but when the sun disappears, all is well
again. A sleeping bag feels good as temperatures fall.
</P>
<P>
   And even during the hottest part of the day, the pines provide
shade and comfort as you sit against one and devour a sack lunch.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of blistering heat in the desert, highways to
the mountains will be glutted with vehicles by this afternoon as
Valley residents rush to escape the pizza oven and refresh
themselves over the long July Fourth weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them will spend at least some time fishing for trout.
It's unfortunate that during the heat of summer, when most people
do their trout fishing, results are the poorest.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Arizona Game and Fish Department planned to
attempt to improve fishing by stocking the state's mountain lakes
just before the holiday. Two of the state's most popular fishing
lakes _ Woods Canyon and Willow Springs near here _ were marked for
frequent visits by hatchery trucks carrying trout. Both were to
receive double stockings.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Sorensen, head of hatcheries for Game and Fish, said the
pH factor, which measures the balance of acid to base, is starting
to rise rapidly in the mountain lakes. When the two are perfectly
balanced, the pH reading is 7. If the count is below 7, the acidity
is rising. That almost never happens in Arizona lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never see acidic water here unless there's a mine spill or
something like that,'' Sorensen said. ``What happens is that the
level of base content rises. I think Arizona is all calcium (a base
material).''
</P>
<P>
   That means the pH level rises, and when it does, fish start to
become lethargic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it reaches 9.2 to 9.5, we start to some problems,''
Sorensen said. Somewhere above that, fish will begin to die. At
shallow, weedy lakes such as Sierra Blanca northeast of Big Lake,
the pH reading is rising quickly, he said, but it hasn't risen
substantially at most area lakes.
</P>
<P>
   When monsoon rains arrive, they will bring acid from the air
into the lakes and ease the problem somewhat. ``But it would have
to be a heavy, localized storm cell to make much difference,''
Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
   But because of substantial precipitation during the winter and
spring, lakes should be in a little better condition than they
normally are at this time of year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stream fishing should be better than usual, too. There is more
water running, and pH factors generally are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, the East and West forks of the Black River would be
getting up there by this time of year,'' Sorensen said. ``But we've
had no trouble at all so far this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Weedy lakes suffer the most. The rise in pH is a byproduct of
plant photosynthesis _ a chemical process that plants use when
exposed to light.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why fishing is at its best in the early morning at this
time of year,'' Sorensen said. ``During the night, the
(photosynthesis) stops, and so the water is in the best shape for
fishing in early morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said most lakes on the Mogollon Rim are in good shape. Big
Lake, probably the deepest of the mountain lakes, seldom is
affected much. Trout just go deeper there.
</P>
<P>
   This could be pretty good weekend in the mountains for anglers.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, campfire and smoking restrictions were imposed in
parts of all six National Forests in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the affected areas, smoking, campfires and charcoal are
banned except for developed campgrounds. Until monsoon rains
arrive, fire danger will continue to increase. &QL;

WARNER SADDLES UP `WILD WILD WEST' REMAKE FOR SUMMER '99 RELEASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Warner Bros. has made it official, staking its
claim to next year's Fourth of July weekend with ``Wild Wild West''
as a way of telling rivals to stay away from the lucrative date.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement that Will Smith's next comic adventure
movie will open during the Independence Day weekend ``is the
studio's way of saying, we're so confident that everyone else
should beware and not release their big films at the same time,''
said Paul Dergarabedian, head of tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smart move if they can back it up,'' he added. ``Making
the announcement now creates some good early buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence Day weekend is the prime release date for
Hollywood's big-budget projects, or at least has been in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence Day'' and ``Men in Black'' -- both coincidentally
starring Smith -- posted five-day openings during the 1996 and 1997
July Fourth weekends, respectively, that topped $84 million.
Disney, which claimed this weekend well over a year ago, opened
``Armageddon'' at 20 theaters late Tuesday and took in an
impressive $115,448, then moved it into 3,070 more sites Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Production on ``Wild Wild West'' began in May under ``Men in
Black'' director Barry Sonnenfeld with co-stars Kevin Kline,
Kenneth Branagh and Salma Hayek. It's based on the offbeat TV
series, which ran from 1966-69 and starred Robert Conrad as
debonair government agent James West during the presidency of
Ulysses S. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The script calls for Arliss Loveless, played by Branagh, to plot
a government overthrow with the aid of a massive walking weapon
called The Tarantula.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, said Warner's rivals may still mount a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's got Will Smith, I don't think the idea grabs
you the same way as (`Independence Day')'' he said, adding that
other contenders for the slot include Universal's ``edTV,'' a
comedy similar to ``The Truman Show,'' and Sony's ``Joan of Arc,''
with Milla Jovovich.

THIS ISN'T A TRUE ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO - Excuse me, but Devon White isn't worthy. Neither is
anyone else in a Diamondbacks uniform. And if the Florida Marlins
had a legitimate All-Star, he would've been pawned off months ago.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, but baseball whiffed again Wednesday. It rewarded
mediocrity. It selected a former scab. It ignored a phenomenon. It
made the All-Star Game a joke.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're not laughing, you're in the middle of a big yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Here's all you need to know: Kerry Wood is not going to the
showcase event. Rick Reed, a former replacement player pitching for
the New York Mets, is the second from his team to make the guest
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went?'' the Chicago Cubs' Mark Grace asked, jaw dropping.
``Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   The logic is baffling, and Marlins Manager Jim Leyland and
National League President Len Coleman squandered a golden
opportunity. All Wood did Wednesday was strike out 13 Diamondbacks,
raise his record to 8-3 and further a legacy that has helped
resuscitate the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Visionaries would've seized the moment, promoted the most
dominating pitcher in the game, a 20-year-old who leads the league
in strikeout ratio and opponent batting average. They would
recognize that, aside from Mark McGwire, he probably leads the
league in curious spectators drawn to the ticket window. They would
flaunt his staggering talent and hand him the ball, especially
since Wood won't pitch again until after the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better thing for baseball than take the kid and start
him?'' Grace said. ``He's the guy people want to see. Kerry Wood in
Colorado against the best hitters in the American League would've
been a great story for baseball. I know the ratings would've been
very high, and it would've been a great marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, visionaries wouldn't have invited Albert Belle to
Cleveland last year, where he refused to take part in workouts,
wouldn't lend his face to the team picture and basically disgraced
the event. And they certainly wouldn't have embraced a work
stoppage that almost killed the game.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, they don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come from miles around to see Kerry pitch,'' Grace
said. ``Kerry has turned baseball upside down. He is special, a
captivating player who can dominate like nobody in the game today.
He's more deserving than just about anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is a silly rule that states every team must
have a representative. It is counterproductive, backwards and
responsible for the selection of White, a nice player enjoying a
nice season and nothing more. It is responsible for Fernando Vina,
an average sort who has been caught stealing 10 times in 21
attempts, whose only fling with infamy remains the forearm he took
from Belle. It is responsible for Ugueth Urbina, Edgar Renteria and
Rolando Arrojo.
</P>
<P>
   Gentleman, this is not Little League, where tender psyches must
be protected and every uniform must be on display. All the while,
Grace and the St. Louis Cardinals' Brian Jordan will sit home with
averages hovering around .350.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I went because one of us crummy Cubs had to go,''
Grace said. ``The only disappointment is, I thought for sure I
could help the National League in the home run hitting contest. So
I guess they'll miss out on the fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is criticism over the merits of a popularity
contest, the All-Star vote should belong to the fans. Each league
names its reserves to correct any glaring mistakes, which is fine
in theory. Except the quota system only makes the problem worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened, it would've been an honor. But it didn't,''
Wood said. ``Maybe next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is one year too late. This is supposed to be a marquee
event for the fans, and more than anything, the suits should give
you whom you want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood or Andy Ashby?
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they held signs in the bleachers in Chicago for
every strikeout. And while they reached double digits for the fifth
time in 15 starts, a few K's were left over when Wood called it a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Hang 'em anyway. For Leyland, Coleman and a game that could use
a crash course in marketing. &QL;

 &HT;    HR in 9th rescues Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ Russ Springer was initiated into Atlanta's
Order of the Torch Wednesday night. Due only to Chipper Jones and a
ninth-inning bolt from the blue, the newest Brave found himself
with his first win too. Wilted, but valid.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Springer had blown away a one-run lead (and John
Smoltz's win) in a two-run eighth, Jones lined a low-flying two-run
homer to right off Tampa Bay closer Roberto Hernandez with Walt
Weiss on base to give the Braves a 6-5 victory over the Devil Rays.
Hernandez hadn't given up a run in 22 appearances, Jones hadn't hit
a homer before this night in 13 days and the Braves had come from
behind in the ninth only once before all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you don't get a chance to do that very often,''
said Jones, playing before a large group of family friends from his
hometown of DeLand, Fla., two hours away. ``When you do it, it's
special.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Jones' second of the night and his 20th this
season, giving him two two-HR games this year and six in his
career. Kerry Ligtenberg then finished the game for his eighth
save, ending it on a double-play by Wade Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   Springer came in to guard a 4-3 lead for Smoltz (six innings,
five hits) but he coughed up two runs on a pair of singles by John
Flaherty and Dave Martinez, a Gerald Williams throwing error and
Rich Butler sacrifice fly for a 5-4 Tampa Bay advantage. The blown
save was the bullpen's ninth in 27 opportunities and its third in
the last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good win for the team,'' said Springer, now 5-3 but
chagrined by the win. ``Obviously if you go in there and you give
up the lead like I did, the next thing is damage control, to try to
keep it close and give your team a chance in the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   That chance was not vast. Hernandez, who entered the game with
17 saves, had yielded just one homer all year and no runs in his
previous 24 1/3 innings pitched. Weiss singled to open the inning
before Keith Lockhart struck out to bring up Jones, who had hit a
monstrous solo over nearly 420 feet in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the guy throws hard and you just try to get the head
(of the bat) out and hope that one falls,'' said Jones, who
connected on a 1-1 fastball on the outer half of the plate. ``I
think I hit it 370 and a half (over the 370-foot mark). It was a
line drive that had a little top spin on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Braves' fourth straight and restored their
division lead over the Mets to 9 1/2 games, as large as it has been
this year.

D-BACKS' WHITE MAKES NL ALL-STAR TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
 LL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Devon White is 35, but he has played like a young colt
for the Diamondbacks this season, tracking down virtually
everything hit to him in center field and supplying punch with the
bat.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he was recognized for his efforts by being named
the first player to represent the club on the National League
All-Star team for the game Tuesday at Coors Field in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the third All-Star appearance for White, first in the
NL. He played for the American League in 1989 while with the
California (now Anaheim) Angels and in 1993 while with the Toronto
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting White, who did not start Wednesday's game
against the Chicago Cubs but came up with an RBI infield single as
a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning, is hitting .290 with 12 homers,
45 RBIs and 10 stolen bases. He has hit primarily from the left
side (241 at-bats) with a .273 average, 11 homers and 38 RBIs. From
the right side (80 at-bats), he is hitting .338 with one homer and
seven RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy. I'm healthy and I think I've been playing good
ball,'' White said. ``You always think about it in the back of your
mind, but I've always been the type to wait for things to happen.
It will be good to see some of the guys I haven't seen in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the man who selected him, Jim Leyland, who managed
White with the World Series champion Florida Marlins last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Travis Lee, who also is having a solid season, just as
easily could have been selected to represent the Diamondbacks,
White said. Lee will travel to Denver to participate in the rookie
skills challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tossup,'' White said. ``He's played very well on the
field and been a good example off the field. Maybe it's because
I've paid my dues, I don't know. I just feel pretty good about the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said: ``He's the right guy
to go from our club. We're awful proud of him. He started slow, but
he got it going and has been consistent ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has been in the NL (this is his third season), which
league does White think is superior?
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I thought the American was best, but now I think
the National is the best because it is a pitching and defense
league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game annually adds fuel to the ``Which is best?''
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players always get together and joke around before the
game, but when the game starts, it gets serious. The players take a
lot of pride in that,'' White said. &QL;

A CLUTTERED ROOM HIDES DARK SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With NY-CHILD-ABUSE)   (sw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The daughters' room is nestled inside a cramped
second-floor walk-up in Brooklyn, behind a metal door and past
great bales of clothes, toys and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   On the walls and in photo albums, the girls, now 13 and 14,
smile back from pictures. Sometimes they are hugging their father,
Daniel Robacker, and mother, Theresa Fremgen, and other times they
are with a family friend, Curtis Elam James. But the pictures belie
a dark secret, the police say.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the adults, along with Ms. Fremgen's two brothers,
Ezra and Vincent Fremgen, are suspected of sexually abusing the
couple's teen-age girls and two other 8-year-old boys, the police
say. All five are in custody and awaiting arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Only the children's grandmother, Helen Robacker, remains at her
son's Bushwick home, where the family has lived for eight years.
Hard of hearing and faint of sight, she spent Wednesday in a chair
in her living room, taking calls from reporters and looking up at
the family portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's no troublemaker because I raised him right, just like
my six other kids,'' the 75-year-old woman said as two dogs and a
cat roamed around the small three-room apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is going to be thrown out. This is just phony
baloney. He don't do things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In her son's bedroom, boxes of clothes, toys and bills are piled
high on top of a mattress. Sleeves for pornographic videos rest
near the door, juxtaposed against a father-of-the-year award
hanging on the wall. A sleeve for another pornographic video sits
by the doorjamb of his daughters' room, next to a stuffed bear with
``I love you'' written on its chest. And under the multitude of
photograph albums in the kitchen, two magazines devoted to swinging
peak out for anyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   In the daughters' room, three cages, all filled with hamsters,
sat on the dresser, which overflowed with teen magazines. On a
wall, small stuffed animals were hung up by string.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Morris, a homemaker who was sent to the apartment by
child welfare officials over the last eight months to help take
care of the household, said that she never felt right about the
children. On occasion, she chided Robacker, who is on disability,
about leaving his pornographic videos out for the girls to see and
also told him not to curse so much in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children just came back from the city because of neglect
in that house and I gave them my number to call if they wanted to
talk,'' she said. ``But I don't know what happens after 4 o'clock
because that's when I leave. It's sad, just so sad. The girls never
called.''
</P>
<P>
   Both girls have been placed with the city's Department of
Children's Services.

ROOKIE UPENDS D-BACKS  
 WOOD FRUSTRATES ARIZONA WITH 13 K'S

<P>
   CHICAGO _ KKKKKKKKKKKKKerry Wood did it again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time, the rookie right-hander for the Chicago
Cubs struck out 13 Diamondbacks on the way to a victory. He
scattered three hits through eight innings and watched his bullpen
survive a shaky ninth as the Cubs held on for a 6-4 win over
Arizona at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks fell to 29-55, while the Cubs improved to
44-39. The teams meet again today in the finale of the three-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood was outstanding,'' said Diamondbacks Manager Buck
Showalter, whose team was victimized by Wood's 13 strikeouts in
seven innings on May 11 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who turned 21 a week ago, had a fastball that topped out
at 98 mph Wednesday. But it was his breaking ball that kept the
Diamondbacks off-balance and allowed him to raise his record to
8-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you gear up for that fastball, try and cheat a little bit
so you can get to it, it makes it difficult to pull the trigger,''
Showalter said. ``It just comes on a different plane at a different
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks first baseman Travis Lee, who is Wood's primary
rival for the National League Rookie of the Year Award, struck out
twice against him in Phoenix and three times on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was zoned up for the fastball, and I didn't swing at any
high stuff, but he threw me plenty of breaking pitches,'' Lee said.
``He threw me three different kinds of sliders. There was a
12-to-6, where the hand comes over the top like at 12 o'clock and
the pitch starts out like a fastball, then comes down. There was a
back-door slider that froze me and a Frisbee slider, with some
weird spin that I had never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley's high sky and breezy conditions were a factor in the
Cubs scoring their first run in the second inning off right-hander
Amaury Telemaco (2-3), who was waived by the Cubs on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez led off the inning with a shallow high fly to
the opposite field in left. Diamondbacks shortstop Tony Batista,
filling in for Jay Bell (stiff back), and left fielder Yamil
Benitez converged on the ball, but it dropped and caromed off
Batista's leg into foul territory. Rodriguez wound up at second
with a double and later scored on a sacrifice fly by Tyler Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks tied it, 1-1, in the top of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Wood hit catcher Kelly Stinnett to lead off the inning, and
Telemaco grounded into a fielder's choice. Andy Fox bounced a
single over the head of first baseman Mark Grace and Telemaco took
off for third, surprising Cubs strong-armed right fielder Sammy
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   As he neared third, Telemaco attempted to slide, but his foot
slipped, and he tumbled to the ground awkwardly, finally rolling
safely into the bag. He later scored on Batista's grounder that
third baseman Manny Alexander booted for an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it on the replay and that was one of the ugliest slides
I've ever seen,'' Telemaco said. ``It was actually kind of scary
the way I fell. But things worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Things worked out at least for the moment, but not in the bottom
of the third.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Telemaco (2-3) hit Mickey Morandini in the foot,
and Sosa brought Morandini home with a rocket off the ivy-covered
brick wall in center for a double. Sosa, who set a major league
record with 20 home runs in June and was selected to the NL
All-Star team on Wednesday, had another run-scoring double in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Grace hit an RBI single in the fifth, and a throwing error by
Benitez allowed another run to score to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's David Dellucci tripled to lead off the seventh and
scored on Karim Garcia's sacrifice fly to make it 4-2, but Chicago
increased its lead to 6-2 in its half of the seventh on Sosa's
second double and another RBI single by Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Terry Adams replaced Wood in the ninth, and Cubs
closer Rod Beck replaced Adams. Arizona scored twice, on a grounder
by Brent Brede that went for an error by Grace, and an infield hit
by pinch-hitter Devon White. But Beck got Lee on a fielder's-choice
grounder to pick up his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Telemaco was up in the strike zone with many of
his pitches, ``but he still kept us in the game.'' &QL;

BIG CHANGES IN WINGS FOR ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles, who have not been afraid to spend money
since  &UR; Peter Angelos bought the club in 1993, may be on the verge
of dealing several of their high-salary free agents-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping badly and barely ahead of the expansion Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, Angelos is finally admitting that sweeping changes may be on
the way for what amounts to one of the most stagnant and least
versatile clubs in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of players on the block are second baseman
 &UR; Roberto Alomar _ who is playing as if he has lost interest but you
can bet would play like the All-Star he is after he is traded
(possibly to Atlanta), and first baseman  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro, who
could add some punch to a contending club lacking at first base,
perhaps San Diego or Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a little too early to think about that, but the
time is rapidly approaching,'' Angelos said. ``Will we make moves
to obtain younger players for the future? If it improves our team
in the long term, of course we will. Why not? But we will also
continue to spend what it takes to put a competitive team on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Pat Gillick, who built Toronto into one of the
finest organizations and has been with the Orioles the past three
years, is probably on his way out after this season, the last year
of his three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone,'' one Orioles official said. ``He's told us he's
going to retire. He doesn't like the attitudes throughout baseball,
and he doesn't like some of the attitudes in our clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal Manager  &UR; Felipe Alou offered a biting assessment of the
Orioles after the Expos swept their three-game series last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really didn't see much heart out there,'' Alou said, ``but
we'll take three wins against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore entered play Wednesday 22{ games behind the
division-leading New York Yankees, who are showing no signs of
slowing down. The real dagger through the heart for the Orioles is
their trailing second-place Boston, the wild-card leader, by 12{
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this agonizing and hand-wringing over what's happening is
unnecessary,'' Angelos said. ``Some of the players are out there
not hustling. But they're only human. It's simple: Look at our
pitching. It gets discouraging after a while.'' &QL; 
Trouble in Tampa Bay? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strong rumors continue to persist that Devil Rays Managing
General Partner  &UR; Vince Naimoli is fighting off attempts from
several minority owners who are upset with the loose-lipped point
man of the expansion club.
</P>
<P>
   There has even been talk that some of the minority owners tried
to push Naimoli out of the limelight. Two of them apparently told
Naimoli they were not pleased with some of his recent comments,
several of which have infuriated fans, business leaders and area
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Naimoli apparently has taken the threat seriously enough that he
no longer refers to Tampa Bay's average attendance of 30,000 as
``disappointing.'' &QL; 
Keep looking for cassettes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia pitcher  &UR; Ken Ryan, rehabilitating an injury,
recently had his truck broken into while it sat at Philadelphia
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The thief (or thieves) rummaged through his glove compartment
and actually left behind a  &UR; Cal
 &UR; Ripken autographed baseball, which could be worth $200. ``Maybe
they couldn't read,'' Ryan joked. &QL; 
Hit redial again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove took himself to task for
leaving in pitcher  &UR; Bartolo Colon too long during a start last
week. Colon, who is emerging as an elite pitcher in the AL, wound
up throwing 139 pitches over eight innings in what turned out to be
an 11-0 rout over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove explained that he thought Colon had thrown only 90
pitches after seven innings, not the actual 110. Hargrove had set a
120-pitch limit for Colon. One possible explanation for Hargrove's
mix-up with pitch counts could be attributed to his tendency to get
caught up with trying be the official scorer for Indians games.
</P>
<P>
   A few games earlier, Hargrove called the press box eight times
to complain to the official scorer about a decision in the fifth
inning on a grounder by  &UR; Sandy Alomar that was booted by St. Louis
shortstop  &UR; David Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Official scorer  &UR; Rick Rembielak, the head baseball coach at Kent
University, stood his ground and refused to change the call. &QL;

   FLA-FIRES (Miami) _ Florida officials evacuated more than 15,000
in the Ormond Beach area late on Wednesday as dozens of wild fires
whipped by high winds started up in the afternoon and burned dozens
of homes and commercial buildings. Officials said commercial areas
here and Daytona Beach are threatened, and late reports said 30
homes and several cars were destroyed in Brevard County to the
south near Mims. The fire and smoke forced the closing of all major
roads leading into Ormond Beach, a city of about 35,000 people, and
forced the closing of I-95 to Jacksonville.

   THE EVERLASTING STORY OF NORY. By Nicholson Baker. (Random

</P>
<P>
   FLYING LEAP: Stories. By Judy Budnitz. (Picador USA, $20.) A

</P>
<P>

Alou named reserve for NL
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell forced to deal with another All-Star Game snub
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Even though the Astros are playing perhaps the best baseball in
their history and are sitting on a plush cushion atop the National
League Central, their clubhouse was not joyful Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star selections were out, and only two of the National
League's 30 were Astros. Second baseman Craig Biggio was in the
starting lineup via fan election, and left fielder Moises Alou was
added as a reserve by his former manager, Jim Leyland of the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Alou had ``mixed feelings'' about the honor. He had been looking
forward to a rare trip home to the Dominican Republic. Instead, he
will go to Denver next week ``and have fun and see some of my
ex-teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked for more comment about his reunion with former
Marlins, Alou brought the interview session to a close. ``I'm not a
Marlin anymore,'' he said. ``I don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his Astros teammates, he was disappointed at the
size of Houston's delegation to Tuesday's 69th All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be more All-Stars with our record,'' Alou said.
``We're not in first place just because of me and Craig.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astro with the strongest argument is probably right fielder
Derek Bell, who lost out to Dante Bichette of Colorado and Gary
Sheffield of Los Angeles. The three have similar offensive
statistics, but Bell, batting .331 with 11 home runs and 60 RBIs,
is having a better year defensively than the other two.
</P>
<P>
   It's still possible Bell could be chosen, since Colorado
outfielder Larry Walker, who was voted into the starting lineup by
the fans, is on the disabled list with an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker suggested Bell, closer
Billy Wagner and center fielder Carl Everett were having
All-Star-caliber seasons, but he added, ``I look at the National
League team, and I could not fault any of the selections.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell felt snubbed for the second time. He felt he could have
been selected in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come out every game and play hard, but unfortunately I was
snubbed again,'' he said. ``But I know I'm an All-Star in the
Houston community, and that's more important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said an All-Star invitation ``would have been nice,'' but
he did not expect it.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about Sheffield, who is the only Dodger on the
team, Hunsicker said, ``I guess you could make an argument that was
somewhat of a sentimental vote. But Sheffield is having a solid
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield played for Leyland last year, causing suspicions of
bias. But Astros manager Larry Dierker said, ``You've got to pick
your own guys if it's close. It's natural to want to help out a
friend, especially when there's an All-Star bonus involved.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bichette, who benefits from the power-boosting altitude
of Denver, he may have been chosen to appease the local fans. No
doubt Leyland would face an inquisition in Colorado if he had
omitted Bichette, who is batting .336.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker, ``Every manager wants to go to the World Series,
but the price you pay is you have to pick the All-Star reserves the
next year, in which case you can make some enemies. They shouldn't
make the manager do that. Maybe all the managers should vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation with Leyland, Dierker recommended Alou,
Bell and Wagner, adding that Everett and pitcher Mike Hampton would
deserve consideration if they had appeared in more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, there's at least 10 guys who deserve to be on the
team who aren't on it,'' Dierker said, ``and there are usually a
couple of guys on the team who shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is you get some who have been on the All-Star
team 15 times, and they don't care whether they're on it or not.
But the fans vote them in, even when they're not having their best
year. And you get a Devon White (of Arizona) or a Fernando Vina (of
Milwaukee) who has to go because every team has to have a
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou said the All-Star roster should be increased to 40 or
``they should change that rule about picking one player from each
team. It shouldn't be a given that every team has an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunsicker said, ``If you expand the roster, you somewhat
dilute the value of being on the team. It's never gonna be a fair
process.''
</P>
<P>
   It's especially unfair to the National League, which has 16
teams and cannot be as choosy as the American League with its 14
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hunsicker wasn't knocking Leyland, he said, ``There's
nothing fair about the fans' selections; it's who can stuff the
most ballots. It's a difficult process at best.''
</P>
<P>
   And it always causes disappointment.

FEDS SMASH DRUG-MONEY RING AT CHECK-CASHING SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Federal agents smashed a major drug-money
laundering ring with the arrests of nine people, including four
suburban Reseda residents who allegedly helped funnel $3.2 million
through a chain of check-cashing businesses, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a federal indictment, FBI agents raided Supermail
International offices in Reseda, North Hollywood and the company's
Sacramento headquarters, seizing documents and other evidence, said
Tim McNally, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field
office.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nine arrested Wednesday were the company's three top
officers, who police say not only condoned the illegal transfers
but advised undercover agents on how to launder illicit funds, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who ran this business knew drug money was coming in
and they did not resist it,'' McNally said. ``They basically took a
legitimate financial service and corrupted it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-year investigation, code-named ``Operation Mule Train,''
was sparked by a tip from Los Angeles narcotics officers, who
repeatedly saw drug-ring couriers going to Supermail's store in the
6700 block of Reseda Boulevard, McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI then sent undercover agents posing as drug traffickers
into the business. According to the indictment, the store's manager
knowingly agreed to launder drug money for a cash fee.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of subsequent transactions, store employees converted
what they believed to be drug money to cashier's checks or wired
the money to a bank account in Miami, which was in fact an FBI
account, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reseda store was the hotbed of the money-laundering
conspiracy, FBI Special Agent Leslie Gardner stated in the search
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Other Supermail stores were enlisted as the undercover agents
presented larger sums of money, McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the agents were introduced to the company's
corporate managers, including Christine Annette Umbertino, 42, the
chief executive officer, and her brother, Albert Joseph Umbertino,
39, the company's president. Both were arrested Monday at their
homes in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   McNally said the Umbertinos authorized their employees to accept
the drug money and even accepted it themselves. They are also
accused of advising the undercover agents on different ways to
launder money, including buying Supermail stock, which is traded on
the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when you have people who conspire within a
company and merely fail to file currency transaction reports,''
McNally said. ``It's another when you have executive leadership
that has knowledge as well as provides advice on how to conduct
illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Umbertinos were named in the indictment, as was Supermail's
senior vice president, Mercedes Veiga, 45, of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested in Reseda were Rogelio Merlose Jordan, 34, a
former manager of the Reseda store; Salvador Jose Sanchez, 34, the
Reseda store's manager until May 1998; Alberto Dominguez Acosta,
59; and Adelina Acosta.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth Reseda resident named in the indictment, Fernando
Malagon, 27, is in custody in Mexico, according to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   In all, agents funneled $3.2 million through the company before
taking the case to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, McNally
said. A 67-page indictment was returned June 11 and unsealed
Wednesday, along with the search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department narcotics investigation that
preceded Operation Mule Train is separately credited with the
arrests of 333 people on various drug charges; the seizure of 1,000
pounds of cocaine and 1,293 pounds of marijuana, among other drugs;
204 firearms; and $2.3 million in cash, officials said.

CLINTON PRAISES CHINESE BID TO CLEAN UP AIR, WATER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Updated material included) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILIN, China _ President Clinton flew to this famous nature
spot Thursday to play enviro-tourist and review Chinese attempts to
stem decades of ecological degradation.
</P>
<P>
   The scenic stop contrasted with Clinton's two full days in
bustling Shanghai, the country's commercial capital, where the
president was surrounded by skyscrapers, hard-charging
entrepreneurs and a stock market at the heart of China's growing
economy. But the message for both locales was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe China has a huge opportunity to avoid some of the
terrible mistakes we made,'' Clinton told environmentalists in this
provincial town, which some Chinese believe is the most beautiful
of their vast nation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton told U.S. and Chinese business leaders in
Shanghai:
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go forward, we must ensure that economic development
does not lead to environmental catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the issue in an interview with Central Chinese
Television, the national government-owned network, which is to air
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to grow the economy and replenish the
environment,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sino-American ecological initiatives include the Environmental
Protection Agency working with the Chinese on a nationwide air
quality monitoring project.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton predicted that in 10 years people will say the
environmental cooperation is ``one of the biggest things they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his eight-hour visit to the Guilin region, in
south-central China, by discussing environmental issues with U.S.
and local specialists.
</P>
<P>
   James Steinberg, Clinton's deputy national security adviser,
said the Chinese have ``a growing sense of citizens being able to
be active'' in issues such as environment quality without fear of
reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   An industrialist was also scheduled on the program, a Guilin
brewer whom Steinberg credited with sound environmental techniques,
including wastewater disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned an afternoon boat ride down the Li River to
wonder at stone formations that have been the favorites of Chinese
painters and poets for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Li, like other major Chinese rivers, for years was
treated as an open sewer. Some of the hills along the president's
route were stripped of trees by villagers desperate for firewood.
</P>
<P>
   The river has been the focus recently of a cleanup program, and
some local residents now turn animal and farm waste into bio-gas
for cooking and fuel so they do not need to denude nearby forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a real sea-change in attitude,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   After his boat ride, Clinton was to fly on to Hong Kong, the
final stop of his nine-day tour of China, for meetings with
political leaders. The former British colony reverted to Chinese
rule a year ago this week. Clinton was to make a bit of history by
being the first foreign leader to fly into Hong Kong's new
international airport, Chek Lap Kok, three days before its official
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned a trip-closing news conference Friday before a
17-hour flight back to Washington, which includes a refueling stop
in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, Clinton ticked off the alarming data that frame
China's environmental challenges, including the fact that
respiratory illness from air pollution is the nation's biggest
health problem. Steinberg said China has five of the 10
most-polluted cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every major body of water is polluted,'' Clinton said. ``The
water table is dropping all over the country. China is about to
assume the unfortunate distinction of replacing the United States
as the largest emitter &UR;  &LR; of greenhouse gases that are dangerously
warming our planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, however, that sound environmental policy and
slower economic growth did not necessarily go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have example after example after example of countries whose
economies are doing well as they adopt more sensible environmental
and energy practices,'' Clinton said. ``And energy companies in the
United States are making a significant share of their profits
through conservation and the implementation of technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollution may also have played a part in Clinton's sometimes
raspy voice after five days in Beijing and Shanghai, where there is
almost always a haze in the air caused at least in part by
industrial and automotive exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6 million Chinese travel annually to Guilin to take
the Li cruise, famous for the limestone outcroppings known as
``karsts.'' The formations jut up to 600 feet above fruit orchards
and rice fields and bear such evocative names as ``Painted Hill of
Nine Horses'' and ``The Frog Crossing the River.''

ANALYSIS: DECISION IS STINGING REBUKE FOR STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite; deletes original 5th graf; inserts a
graf about Susan McDougal after original 8th graf; no other
changes)  (With STARR-HUBBELL) 
(mk) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
has taken a lot of grief lately from Democrats in Congress,
President Clinton's lawyers and friends and some journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday he faced criticism from a far more troublesome
source, in a carefully but harshly worded judicial opinion that
dismissed Starr's tax case against a former Justice Department
official, Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Robertson of the U.S. District Court here hit Starr
on two fronts, saying he did not correctly understand his purview
and was overly zealous in his pursuit of Hubbell. Robertson called
the counsel's pursuit of Hubbell a ``quintessential fishing
expedition,'' and last week called some of Starr's constitutional
views ``scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which Starr's office said he would appeal, was a
stinging rebuke for the independent counsel. It came after other
recent setbacks, including the release from prison of Susan
McDougal, another central figure in Starr's Whitewater
investigation; the Supreme Court's refusal to grant emergency
consideration of Starr's efforts to force the testimony of Secret
Service employees and a White House aide, Bruce Lindsey; and the
Supreme Court's decision that Starr could not pierce the
attorney-client privilege between Vincent Foster Jr., the White
House lawyer who committed suicide, and his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's decision was directed more personally at Starr
than the other court decisions. Indeed, it is the first time a
court has passed judgment on the independent counsel's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Its effect may also be, in some ways, even more vexing for Starr
than the other rulings. In losing this skirmish, Starr has lost,
for the time being anyway, his ability to use the tax charges as a
way to pressure Hubbell into cooperating with the larger Whitewater
investigation. The independent counsel has long believed that
Hubbell has knowledge of misdeeds by the president and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell is a longtime friend to the Clintons, dating to their
days in Little Rock, Ark.; he is also a former law partner of Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the pressure has similarly been eased for Mrs. McDougal,
who has refused to answer questions before Starr's Arkansas grand
jury and was sent to jail by Starr to force her testimony, her
knowledge of the Clintons' interests is not as wide-ranging as
Hubbell's. Mrs. McDougal, a former business associate of the
Clintons from Arkansas, was freed from prison last month for health
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Given the protracted, seesaw nature of the four-year legal
combat between Starr and the president, it would be perilous to
view any single development in the complex web of the independent
counsel's investigation as decisive. And Robertson, though he wrote
a careful opinion, was challenging some contrary findings by other
judges, and is, after all, only a district judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you have to look at this kind of investigation is like
a trial where both sides have their ups and downs,'' said Theodore
Boutrous Jr., a litigator at the Washington law firm of Gibson,
Dunn &AMP; Crutcher. Boutrous, who was a member of former President
Reagan's legal team in the Iran-Contra investigation, added, ``It's
impossible to draw sweeping conclusions from what happens on a
particular day.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's decision was the talk of the city's law firms and
political circles, already abuzz over an article in the magazine
Brill's Content that accused Starr's office of unethical leaks to
reporters. The judge's opinion dismissing the tax case against
Hubbell gave Starr's doubters significant and fresh material.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hubbell had already served 17 months in prison after
pleading guilty to fraud in an earlier case brought by Starr
involving Hubbell's former law firm, some viewed the indictment of
Hubbell and his wife on tax charges last April as overly harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just days after Starr filed the tax charges against the
Hubbells, he had Mrs. McDougal indicted on three counts of criminal
contempt and obstruction of justice for failing to answer questions
from his grand jury. Like Hubbell, Mrs. McDougal had already been
severely punished, having completed an 18-month jail term for civil
contempt on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   Given that both actions came as the Arkansas Whitewater grand
jury was running out of time and steam, both supporters and critics
saw Starr's moves against both Hubbell and Mrs. McDougal as efforts
to increase the pressure on them to provide embarrassing
information about the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both instances he seems to be wielding the hammer of Thor
to swat at mosquitoes,'' said Richard Ben-Veniste, a Washington
lawyer who has represented prominent Democrats and was a Watergate
prosecutor and Senate minority counsel. ``Judge Robertson's action
will give further credence to the critics of Starr that he has been
overly aggressive in pursuing individuals who would not otherwise
be prosecuted, simply to be able to get some information from them
that he can use against President and Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Ginsberg, a litigator at Patton, Boggs &AMP; Blow,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what prosecutors do,'' Ginsberg said. ``Hubbell was a
key source of information who was reluctant to talk. It was a
pressure point that Starr was applying.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic act of defiance, Hubbell and his wife appeared
outside their home on the day of the indictment as Hubbell
declared, ``The independent counsel can indict my dog, they can
indict my cat, but I'm not going to lie about the president.'' Mrs.
McDougal also used strong language after her indictment on May 4,
saying, ``It is true that no man is above the law, but neither
should any man be asked to break the law in order to buy his
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   If one of Starr's points in pursuing Hubbell and Mrs. McDougal
was to win a war of wills against them, he appears to have lost.
Hubbell, declaring himself ``grateful'' for Wednesday's decision,
is out of Starr's sights for the time being. And Mrs. McDougal,
enjoying freedom after another federal judge granted her release
last month on health grounds, faces trial on the contempt charges
in the fall. But she has repeatedly said she will not tell Starr
anything.

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BALLAD OF FRANKIE SILVER. By Sharyn McCrumb. (Dutton,
$23.95.) A case of 19th-century frontier justice and the modern-day
execution of a killer are interwoven in this Appalachian mountain
tale of love, loyalty and murder. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLIND DESCENT. By Nevada Barr. (Putnam, $22.95.) On a
hair-raising mission into a ``monster man-eating cave'' in Carlsbad
Caverns, a National Park Service ranger discovers that a member of

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIT MAN. By Lawrence Block. (Morrow, $22.) A killer named Keller
reacts to a midcareer crisis by becoming involved in the lives of
his intended targets, in a series of murderous adventures that are
both funny and full of rue. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MOOR. By Laurie R. King. (St. Martin's, $23.95.) The cheeky
premise of this artful historical mystery -- that Sherlock Holmes
has taken a young, brainy wife -- sends the sleuthing pair to
Dartmoor to investigate sightings of a huge, ghostly beast. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NIGHT DOGS. By Kent Anderson. (Bantam, $22.95.) A street cop in
Portland, Ore., works himself into a hellish state of mind as he
pounds his wretched beat in 1975, reliving his own nightmares as a
Green Beret in Vietnam. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``N'' IS FOR NOOSE. By Sue Grafton. (Holt, $25.) The cocky
shamus Kinsey Millhone is ignored, insulted and otherwise put in

<P>
   WINGS OF FIRE. By Ian Rutledge. (St. Martin's, $23.95.) The wild
scenery and dark legends of the Cornish countryside provide the

<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE FICTION &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CIRCUIT OF HEAVEN. By Dennis Danvers. (Eos/Avon, $14.) ``Romeo
and Juliet in Cyberspace'' might be the subtitle of this moving
love story, in which technological barriers threaten to separate an
appealing pair of ``star-cross'd lovers'' as painfully as the more
traditional barriers of class and clan. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FLESH AND GOLD. By Phyllis Gotlieb. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95.)
Set mostly in a far-future brothel that caters to the desires of
``15 kinds of humanity,'' this labyrinthine novel by a
distinguished Canadian poet takes an almost perverse pleasure in
affirming the universality of human lust and greed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PACIFIC EMPIRE. By G. Miki Hayden. (JoNa Books, Box 336,
Bedford, Ind. 47421, paper, $12.95.) A ``what if'' novel in which
the Japanese defeat the United States in World War II. By focusing
on individuals instead of geopolitics, Hayden immerses the reader
in a world that feels no less real for being counterfactual. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX CAFE. By Gwyneth Jones. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95.)
Suffering is the bond that brings humans and aliens together in
this deeply affecting novel, which concludes a trilogy that began
with ``White Queen.'' Instead of neatly wrapping up all loose ends,
Jones invites the reader to accept the mystery at the core of all
intimate relationships. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG. By Connie Willis. (Spectra/Bantam,
$23.95.) This delightful addition to Willis's series of time-travel
tales (which includes the poignant ``Fire Watch'' and the tragic
``Doomsday Book'') is a cheery romp through Victorian England on
the trail of a monstrosity called the ``bishop's bird stump.'' &QL;

   TOKYO _ Aiming to dampen Japanese citizens' enthusiasm for war,
the U.S. military aired disheartening radio programs in Japanese
shortly before World War II ended.
</P>
<P>
   Taketoshi Yamamoto, a Hitotsubashi University professor of
psychology, spent two years studying espionage activities and
propaganda carried out by Japan and the United States during the
World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered scripts and documents related to the radio
broadcasts at the National Archive and Records Administration of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yamamoto, a total of 124 episodes of a program
called ''The Citizens' Voice'' were aired between April and August
of 1945. The programs were broadcast from Saipan after the American
military seized the island.
</P>
<P>
   Under the surveillance of the Office of Strategic Services
(OSS), the former body of the Central Intelligence Agency, groups
of Japanese-Americans were gathered in studios outside of New York
and Washington to produce the program.
</P>
<P>
   The OSS also brought in three Japanese prisoners of war to
describe the situation in Japan so that the program's contents
would not contradict actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts were written in Japanese under the guidance of
authorities, translated into English for checking by the U.S.
military, and then recorded in a studio in San Francisco. Two weeks
worth of programs were then flown to Saipan for broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The first broadcast was aired at 7 p.m. on April 23 local time.
</P>
<P>
   According to the scripts, a ``patriotic Japanese'' named Oishi
denounced Hideki Tojo, the prime minister at the time, and the
Japanese military, saying they were jeopardizing the nation. He
called out for citizens to unite and salvage the country with their
own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Letters sent from a woman to her husband at war were read aloud
and popular music, prohibited by the Japanese military, was played
during the 30-minute program.
</P>
<P>
   During times of war, nations have been known to broadcast
programs in the enemy's language. At first, broadcasts were aired
by shortwave to reach lands several thousands of kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of War Information began airing ``Voice of America''
from February 1942. At around the same time, Japan Broadcasting
Corp. (NHK) began airing an English-language program on shortwave.
</P>
<P>
   Female announcers, taking the name of Tokyo Rose, conveyed
messages in English to American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But programs like ``VOA'' were only available to
government-related officials in Japan since the government banned
its citizens from listening to foreign broadcasts and from
possessing shortwave radios.
</P>
<P>
   Medium-wave broadcasting, on the other hand, was widely
available to citizens so that they could receive air-raid warnings.
About 7 million radios existed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, the U.S. military planned to air ``The
Citizens' Voice'' through medium-wave broadcasting, but the program
could not reach Japanese shores from the American mainland. But the
U.S. occupation of Saipan in July 1944 enabled the military to
begin broadcasting ``VOA'' on medium wave. The programs began in
December 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The following April, using the same wavelength as NHK's, the
military began broadcasting ``The Citizen's Voice.'' Within the
military, the covert program was called ``black radio'' in contrast
to ``white radio,'' which referred to the public broadcasting
program ``OI.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Akiko Takeyama, former professor of media history
at Showa Women's University, NHK documents reveal that NHK tried to
sabotage the broadcast by airing disturbing noises such as the
sound of people talking.
</P>
<P>
   Interference was sent out through radio stations nationwide, but
residents in some areas on the Pacific coast were able to tune in
to the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Norio Tamura, Tokyo Keizai University professor of
communications, said the secret programs were an excellent military
strategy, ``because they were aired through the only waves Japanese
citizens were allowed access to.'' &QL;

UZI SPREE IN BAR HURTS NO ONE BUT GUNMAN

<P>
   LANCASTER, Calif. &UR;  &LR; -- A trailer park resident in a dispute with
the park's manager shot up a neighboring bar with an Uzi submachine
gun before being subdued by patrons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Anderson entered the Del Sur Gardens Bar, 9020 W. Ave.
J, shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday, ordered a drink and got into an
argument with the park manager. He left, but soon returned armed
and wearing a camouflage jacket, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked in and told everyone to leave but (the park
manager),'' bartender Lori Nard said. ``Then he fired two shots
into the air and no one moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson fired the weapon in a circular motion into the bar's
ceiling before Danny Farrell, 37, jumped up next to him, grabbed
the front end of the Uzi and pulled the gunman onto a pool table as
he continued to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Other patrons helped subdue Anderson until deputies arrived. He
was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and was being held at
the Lancaster sheriff's station in lieu of $500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Bar representatives said Anderson was angry with the trailer
park's manager, who he thought had been gossiping about him.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is about 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

RANGERS LOSE THE HANDLE, AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

By JOHHNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It appeared to be another harmless ground
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing hitter puts ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore retires hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Happens every time. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore did not field the ninth-inning ground ball off the bat
of Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Jim Eisenreich cleanly,
and the National League visitors parlayed the extra out into three
unearned runs en route to a 7-5 victory last night at The Ballpark
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat marked the Rangers' fourth in succession, and poor
defensive play contributed significantly in two of those.
</P>
<P>
   That does not please Rangers manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what: I'm frustrated, and I'm tired of explaining
it,'' Oates said. ``Let them explain it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the ninth inning with a one-run advantage
and an All-Star on the mound. Rangers closer John Wetteland (2-1)
retired pinch hitter Roger Cedeno on strikes before surrendering a
one-out single to second baseman Wilton Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland induced a ground ball from Eisenreich, and McLemore
strayed to his left for what appeared to be the inning's second
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do too much _ not necessarily getting a double
play, but trying to keep the tying run from scoring position,''
McLemore said. ``I know better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore wanted to retire Guerrero at second base, yet he
retired no one by failing to field the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he booted it to me,'' Oates replied when asked
to assess the play. ``I've seen Mac make that play and get the
force at second many, many times. I'm not sure if he had a shot or
not. In hindsight, I'd rather see him get the out at first. Strike
out \RRaul\S Mondesi, and we're in here celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, whom Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove selected for the
American League All-Star team earlier in the afternoon, retired
Mondesi on strikes with a 2-2 fastball up in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Gary Sheffield to the plate, and Wetteland quickly
threw two strikes past the right fielder. Sheffield, though, lined
Pitch No. 3 into center field for a game-tying single. Dodgers
first baseman Eric Karros then delivered a two-run double that
scored Eisenreich and Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   The out McLemore gave away proved costly and strapped the
Rangers with their first defeat in 43 games when leading after
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to nail the game down regardless,'' said
Wetteland, who failed to convert a save opportunity for only the
third time in 25 opportunities. ``I was ineffective in doing that
tonight. The record shows that I was one pitch away from getting
the job done, but I didn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Rangers' defense. The ninth-inning problems
spoiled the home debut of Todd Van Poppel, who would have been the
winn

wretched first half of the season with a 2-5 won-loss record,
almost no saves and an earned run average above 7.00. Name the
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Heathcliff Slocumb? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Charlton? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   But not in 1998 as an Oriole, or 1997 as a Mariner _ in 1995, as
a Philadelphia Phillie.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of '95, Charlton was so lousy that a moribund
team like the Phillies waived him in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate Mariners, on the verge of moving out of Seattle,
picked him up. Three months later, Charlton more than any single
Mariner had turned around a franchise, brought it a division title
and initiated the momentum that is creating America's most
expensive ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The point? Charlton's two stellar months in '95 are about the
last time anything unexpectedly good happened to Mariner pitching.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, the breathtaking inability to find,
keep or improve pitching is why the Mariners find themselves so
distant from Anaheim they mustnext draft the Hubble telescope.
</P>
<P>
   In the accounting of the Mariner decay in Tuesday's P-I, one
statistic leaped out: In the past four seasons, including this one,
the Mariners have used 54 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of teams have short stays for pitchers during emergencies.
The Mariner churn is relentless, profound and annual.
</P>
<P>
   In '95, the Mariners used 24 pitchers, including 16 who won at
least one game. In '96, they had 20 pitchers, 18 of whom won at
least once. Last year, 16 of the 24 won games. This year, they have
settled down to 15 pitchers, nine with victories. They've also
settled into last place.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another teaser: Based on number of starts, name the No. 4
starter in the Mariner rotation in each of the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, you'll never get it without multiple media guides.
Salomon Torres had 13 starts in '95. Bob Wells had 16 in '96. Last
season Bob Wolcott had 18.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Wolcott are gone, and after a horrendous spring
training Wells would have been gone except the Mariners had no one
else. So he and his 5.52 ERA sit in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Nos. 2 and 3 starters for the first two years of
contention also are gone (Chris Bosio and Tim Belcher in '95,
Sterling Hitchcock and Wolcott in '96), and as with Torres, the
Mariners have nothing in exchange for them on the major league
roster.
</P>
<P>
   No club can flourish with this kind of flailing in the game's
most important element. Rather than flourish, the Mariners were
blessed with long-overdue good fortune that in 1998 has vaporized.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Mariners won 90 games. In '96 they won 85. In the
strike-shortened season of '95, they would have projected to a
full-season total of 87. Good seasons, but nothing indicative of
greatness. Aside from a 19-8 September in '95 and a 20-7 June in
'97, the Mariners have been average over the previous three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This average team was elevated in '95 by three forces: a weak
division led by the collapse of the Angels, career-best years by
several hitters, and a good bullpen. None of that is happening this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In '95, Charlton pitched 47 innings in 30 appearances and had a
1.51 ERA. Also in the 'pen was Jeff Nelson (78 innings in 62
appearances, 2.17 ERA) and Bill Risley (in 60 innings in 45 games,
3.13 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson and Risley were traded, Charlton returned to his
Phillie form and the 'pen began to circle the drain.
</P>
<P>
   The blame game for this pitching debacle is universal: Ownership
has made penny-wise and pound-foolish decisions with the budget and
has sometimes interfered in baseball decisions, talent has been
squandered in unproductive trades by Woody Woodward, and manager
Lou Piniella has little tolerance for pitchers in general and
almost no capacity to develop youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Four pitching coaches in Piniella's six years, combined with
respectable success by pitchers after they have left Seattle (see
Mike Jackson, Belcher, Nelson, Andy Benes, Omar Olivares,
Hitchcock, Risley, Derek Lowe) offers evidence that Piniella and
the organization don't know what they want, and can't keep it even
if they find it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem also goes beyond the current leadership to the
historic baseball dilemma in Seattle and many markets of unstable
ownerships and unbalanced industry economics. The club has invested
relatively little in its system foundation because of the almost
annual desperation to win big, sell tickets and get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a lot about what is spent on the major league
level,'' Woodward said Tuesday. ``But teams like Atlanta, Toronto
and others have done a very effective job throughout their
organizations in spending money to build their systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The current owners invested in a homer-happy lineup that has put
fans in the seats, a stadium in the ground and a temporary curtain
over the club's fundamental weaknesses. But with so many regulars
having sub-par offensive and defensive seasons, the curtain is gone
and the Mariners are exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The question of this season is not, ``How did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, ``What took so long to return to normal?''

THOUSANDS FLEE AS WILDFIRES SURGE IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page) (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ More than 18,000 people were evacuated in northeast
Florida late on Wednesday as wildfires whipped by high winds burned
dozens of homes and businesses bringing a threat that had affected
mostly rural areas to the midst of population centers.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations were taking place in the counties of Volusia,
Brevard, and Flagler, with 15,000 residents forced out of their
homes in the city of Ormond Beach north of Daytona Beach in Volusia
County alone.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuations are the largest since fires began on Memorial
Day, burning more than 250,000 acres in northern Florida,
temporarily closing highways and causing sporadic evacuations of
hundreds of residents. The fires around the state have caused $190
million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials said commercial areas in Ormond Beach and
Daytona Beach are threatened. Thirty homes and several cars were
reported to have been destroyed in Brevard County, to the south of
Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The fire and smoke forced the closing of all major roads leading
into Ormond Beach, a city of about 35,000 people, and forced the
closing of Interstate 95 from Titusville to Jacksonville, about 125
miles. Other roads were also closed, including State Road 40.
</P>
<P>
   State emergency management officials said 112 new fires started
on Wednesday when late afternoon winds, clocked at 15 miles per
hour, scattered sparks over several miles in the affected counties,
starting about 4:30 p.m. Dozens of firefighters, many of them
exhausted from days of battling brush fires, were unable to keep up
with the new blazes, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Volusia County officials called for assistance on Wednesday
night from nearby Orlando and other communities to send available
firemen and police.
</P>
<P>
   Residents forced to leave have been put up in six shelters and
others drove to neighboring cities in Florida. No injuries or
deaths were reported.
</P>
<P>
   But Volusia County hospitals reported treating 150 people for
respiratory problems, asthma and heart ailments in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles is scheduled to visit the area Thursday
morning. Last week he ordered a ban on individual use of fireworks
this Fourth of July because of the extreme drought conditions
caused by meager rain and relentless heat, the driest the state has
been in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has declared the state a disaster area and
nearly $35 million in federal money has been spent fighting
hundreds of wildfires that have sprung up mostly in rural areas of
northern and central Florida since May. More than 80,000 acres have
been destroyed in Volusia County _ about 10 percent of the county _
in the last two weeks.

FOR GIANTS' REED, SON SHINES BRIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ There are worse trials in life than pitching at Coors
Field and Candlestick Point night in and night out. Former
Chatsworth High standout Steve Reed, who has called both places
home during a seven-year major-league career, used to immerse
himself in children's charities, the better to remember that the
altitude of Denver and the gales that whip through the San
Francisco Bay are nothing next to some other adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The reliever remains a regular visitor to children's hospital
wards. Lately, knock on wood, it hasn't been to look in on his own
flesh and blood. The second son of Reed and his wife Terry was born
in September of 1996 with Achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism that
afflicts roughly 1 out of every 25,000 babies born in the United
States. Over the past 21 months Logan Reed has made more trips to
the emergency room than his dad has to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The Reeds' youngest child had trouble breathing for the longest
time, the result of an underdeveloped rib cage that limited how
much his lungs were able to expand. In the first year of Logan
Reed's life, Steve's days were one continuous loop, from the
ballpark to the hospital to home.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the rest of his day, pitching was a relief. Reed was
exhausted most of the time but his statistics were nothing to yawn
at. In 1997, he was one of only two pitchers on the Rockies staff
who managed more innings pitched than hits allowed. He finished
with a 4.04 ERA in 63 appearances which, while not as impressive as
his statistics each of the three previous years, wasn't half bad
considering 31 of his 62 innings came in the cinder box of
oxygen-deprived Coors Field, where hitters routinely catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   To Reed's surprise, the Rockies let him become a free agent over
the winter rather than offer him arbitration at some $1.8 million.
To someone whose life already was fraught with complications, the
prospect of having to either uproot Logan from his doctors or
extricate himself from his wife and two children for half the year
was daunting indeed to Reed.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that shortly after Reed's agents put out feelers, they
found themselves fielding four concrete offers. Having options was
a godsend to Reed, who said, ``Without a doubt, my son's situation
was one of the most important considerations in where I went.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasted little time making a decision, signing with the
Giants, with whom he had started his major-league career in 1992,
four days into his free agency. Being only an hour's plane ride
from his parents in Chatsworth was a plus, as was the easy
availability of top-notch medical care. Reed also felt an affinity
for manager Dusty Baker.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, the Dodgers never called.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny what happens when you let yourself lean into life's
blind curves instead of stubbornly trying to straighten the road.
The move, which at first seemed an onerous proposition, has proved
providential. Logan has responded wonderfully to the climate in the
Bay Area, to the point where he now requires his tank of liquid
oxygen only at night instead of being dependent on it at all times.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mutant gene that causes dwarfism, Reed never would
have wished it upon his son but now can honestly say it has been a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's changed our lives in the most amazing ways,'' Reed said
Wednesday before the Giants' interleague game against the Angels.
``He has brought us closer together as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan's presence has driven home to Reed what really matters and
it's not striking out the clean-up hitter in the ninth to preserve
a win, not even if it's the seventh game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I thought I was a pretty good guy,'' Reed said.
``I was involved in charities and I spent time at the children's
hospitals and I thought my eyes were opened to what really is
important. Then Logan was born and my priorities changed. Baseball
takes a back seat somewhat. I'm not going to live and die over the
game. In the grand scheme of things, I know that hanging a few
sliders, even though it bothers me, is not a life-and-death thing.
I don't bring it home with me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, too, how the minute you stop bleeding over the
results, there doesn't seem to be much cause for hemorrhaging. Reed
went into Wednesday's game with a 1.93 ERA over 42 innings in 38
games. Set-up men generally get little support when the time comes
to fill out the All-Star rosters. But you won't find Reed reeling
from his exclusion from Tuesday's midseason classic at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, it's a blessing that he's getting a few days off
when he is, during the Little People of America Conference in
Woodland Hills. All the best doctors in the field of dwarfism will
be there, and so, too, will Reed, his wife and their sons. Baker,
sympathetic to Reed's situation, has given the pitcher permission
to miss the Giants' exhibition game in Fresno two days after the
All-Star game to take care of this vital piece of family business.
</P>
<P>
   When Baker broke into the majors, in Atlanta in 1968, the
traveling secretary was a dwarf. He was one of the finest men Baker
has known. One day, Baker will tell Reed all about how the late
Donald Davidson enriched the lives of everyone he met.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was reminded of Davidson the other day when he saw Reed's
4-year-old son Dylan and Logan at the ballpark. ``A lovable little
man,'' is how Baker described Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Reed prefers ``a little miracle.'' &QL;

POLICE OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE COVER-UP IN CHOKING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHARLE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six days after former Police Officer Francis Livoti
was convicted in federal court of violating the civil rights of a
Bronx man who died in his custody, the Police Department announced
on Wednesday night that it had placed his former partner and
another officer on modified duty.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken as the department investigates allegations
that the two officers had perjured themselves and colluded to cover
up for Livoti.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. William Monahan, 34, and Police Officer Mario Erotokritou,
32, were both present on Dec. 22, 1994, when Anthony Baez was taken
into custody by Livoti after his football hit Livoti's police
cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Baez died after a confrontation with the officers outside his
family's home in the University Heights section of the Bronx that
night. At Livoti's criminal trial in 1996, the officers testified
that Livoti never used a chokehold on Baez.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government said it had testimony from a police
officer that other officers had concocted a cover story to protect
Livoti, saying that a black man had choked Baez to death before
running off.
</P>
<P>
   A Bronx judge eventually acquitted Livoti of criminally
negligent homicidee, but not before the judge called the testimony
of Livoti's fellow officers ``a nest of perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir had said that the department
would wait until the federal civil rights had concluded before
considering action against any of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this investigation very seriously,'' Safir said on
Wednesday night. ``This investigation will go forward wherever it
leads.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``in the best interest of the department'' that
Monahan and Erotoktiou be placed on modified duty while the
investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan and Erotokritou will have their guns and badges taken
away and will be assigned to administrative tasks until the
investigation is completed, the commissioner said. He would not say
why another officer who testified, Officer Anthony Farnan, was left
on patrol duty.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, who was specifically asked to supervise Livoti at the
46th Precinct because of the high number of civilian complaints
that had been brought against Livoti, is a seven-year veteran of
the force.
</P>
<P>
   Erotokritou has been with the department for eight years. &QL;

YANKEES BEAT PHILLIES, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scoreboard message begged the fans to make some
noise in the fifth inning on Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, but
the electronic plea was unnecessary. The decibel level had started
to increase when Tino Martinez sauntered to the plate with the
bases loaded. Martinez had homered off Philadelphia's Matt Beech
three innings earlier, so everyone affiliated with the Yankees was
hoping he could go deep again.
</P>
<P>
   The noise might have unnerved the 26-year-old Beech. He tossed
one, two, three balls out of the strike zone and the din got
louder. Finally, the Phillies left-hander threw a strike. But when
Beech uncorked another hittable pitch, Martinez rapped it sharply
between first and second base for a two-run single. The hit was
more effective than the scoreboard at eliciting a raucous response.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's timely and well-placed grounder turned a one-run lead
into a three-run margin that David Wells and the Yankees made stand
up for a 5-2 victory over Philadelphia. Wells celebrated being
appointed to the All-Star team earlier in the day by pitching seven
stellar innings and improving to 11-2. Martinez celebrated coming
through in the sort of spot that he has not thrived in often enough
to his liking this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't set any numbers goals,'' Martinez said. ``I want
consistency. I want to be consistent from week to week and month to
month. I want to hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has found consistency. The Yankee left-hander gave up one
earned run and seven hits, and extended his streak without a walk
to 36 innings, though he did not have an effective curveball. Since
Wells is on schedule to pitch next Tuesday, is on the elite team in
the major leagues and has a perfect game on his resume, he will
most likely start the All-Star Game for the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled to make the team, but I couldn't show any
emotion today,'' said Wells, who used his split-finger fastball and
sinker in place of the curve. ``I had a job to do. This game is
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was not among the five Yankees named to the All-Star
team on Wednesday, but he was valuable on Wednesday night with a
homer, a single and four runs batted in. He entered the game with
only 18 hits in his last 101 times at bat since being drilled in
the back by a pitch from Armando Benitez of the Orioles six weeks
ago. But on Wednesday night, Martinez exhibited the kind of bat
speed and compact stroke that makes him such a lethal hitter. He
leads the Yankees with 12 homers and 61 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed one like this, hitting the ball hard and getting
four rbi's,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ``I think he'll be able to
sleep better than he's been able to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez was reminded that his statistics translate to 25
homers and 128 rbi for a full season, he said: ``That's not bad. I
wouldn't say I'm struggling. It's consistency I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Beech had stymied left-handed hitters this season, limiting them
to a .167 average while not yielding a homer in 42 straight at-bats
before last night. That changed in the second inning. After Beech
walked Tim Raines, Martinez blasted a shot over the right-field
fence to put the Yankees in front, 2-0. It was Martinez's second
homer in the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Raines singled home a run to make it 3-2 in the fifth before
Martinez's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Wells retired 10 of the first 11 Phillies he faced, but Scott
Rolen disrupted his rhythm by hitting a 3-2 pitch into the
center-field bleachers in the fourth. The ball traveled 422 feet
and made Rolen only the 13th player to knock a ball into the black
part of the bleachers since the Stadium was renovated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies tied it, 2-2, on two singles, Chad Curtis' error in
center field and a grounder. But Wells struck out Mark Lewis to
strand the go-ahead run at third and never faced another situation
as perilous.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the Indians at Jacobs Field, the Braves at Turner
Field, the Mets at Shea Stadium or the Phillies at Yankee Stadium,
the selfless Yankees keep winning at a historic pace. They are
57-20 and sprinting, not hobbling, to the All-Star Game break. It
does not take a scoreboard message to show that is worth cheering
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would be this good,'' Torre said. ``The record,
that's another story. The record is incredible.''

DODGERS' RALLY BEATS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For the first three months of the season, the
Dodgers walked away from a game like Wednesday night's with a loss
and a sense there were plenty to follow.
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't win in the ninth inning with two outs and two
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed after Gary Sheffield fell behind Texas All-Star
closer John Wetteland, who had just blown away Raul Mondesi on
three fastballs. Sheffield also saw Wetteland's heat, but drilled
it into center field to tie a game the Dodgers would win 7-5 when
Eric Karros followed with a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Karros got the game-winning RBI, but this was Sheffield's
victory and one the Dodgers hope is the start of something big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see where it leads,'' Karros said. ``Maybe nothing
happens, maybe we get on a winning streak. Maybe it will help us
with our wild-card chances.''
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the Dodgers have won two straight to
begin the final trip before the All-Star break. They also know that
the Rangers were 42-0 heading into the ninth inning with a lead and
they were 1-38 when trailing after eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has been waiting to catch a little luck,'' Sheffield
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Dodgers 12{ games behind the NL
West-leading San Diego Padres, who beat Oakland 8-4 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, the club's lone representative at next Tuesday's
All-Star Game in Denver, knows the Dodgers caught a break when
Rangers second Mark McLemore booted Jim Eisenreich's grounder to
second with Wilton Guerrero on first.
</P>
<P>
   There was no chance for a double play, but McLemore could have
kept the potential tying run out of scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Mac make that play and get the force at second many
many times,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``I'm not sure if he
had a shot. In hindsight, I'd rather see him get the out at first,
strike out Mondesi and we're in there celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's strikeout should have ended the game, but there was
Sheffield with one final shot.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland started him off with a breaking ball, then came back
with a fastball for strike two. The third pitch was up in
Sheffield's eyes and he whacked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what he did to Mondy and I wanted to be ready,'' said
Sheffield, now batting .333 in 40 games as a Dodger. ``On the first
pitch, I was surprised to see a slider. I thought he tried to be
aggressive and was just able to make contact.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wetteland, the former Dodger who now is one of the game's
premier closers, it was the second blown save in his last six
appearances. The Rangers now have dropped four straight and 13 of
the last 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one pitch away from getting the job done,'' Wetteland
said. ``I didn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory went to Scott Radinsky (3-4), who pitched a
scoreless eighth inning. Antonio Osuna walked Tom Goodwin with one
out, but picked him off. He then struck out Roberto Kelly to end
the game and earned his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   It was Goodwin, who gave the Rangers a 5-4 lead in the sixth
inning when he scored from third on a double steal with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 4-0 lead against Rangers right-hander Todd
Van Poppel and Mondesi was responsible for most of it.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a two-run homer in the first, then tripled home a run in
the third and scored on a sacrifice fly. It was his 18th homer of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers starter Dennis Reyes gave it back in the bottom of
the third when he allowed a RBI double to Kelly, a run-scoring
single by McLemore and an RBI double by Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McMichael took over for Reyes to start the sixth and
allowed three base hits with two outs, including an RBI single by
Kelly that tied the game at four.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Reyes was optioned to Class-A San Bernardino so
he can continue to pitch during the upcoming All-Star break. He
will pitch Tuesday for the Stampede, then make his next Dodgers
start Sunday against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Triple-A catcher Paul LoDuca, who was called up for two days
when the team was in Denver, takes Reyes' place on the roster.

SABERHAGEN STIFLES EXPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The numbers indicate that Bret Saberhagen wasn't quite
good enough to make this year's American League All-Star team. But
after Wednesday night, maybe that isn't the case any longer.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 24,923 at Fenway Park could vouch for him after
Wednesday night's 6-1 Red Sox victory over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   The win was more about the power pitching of Saberhagen than the
ineptness of the Expos, who lost to the Red Sox for a second
straight night. Saberhagen (10-5) allowed just three hits in seven
innings, striking out five and walking none. The victory ties him
with Pedro Martinez for the club high.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's fastball was lively and he threw 27 changeups, 20
for strikes. Mix in an occasional curveball and his stuff was as
good as you'll see in next Tuesday's All-Star Game. Saberhagen
hadn't won 10 or more games since 1994, when he went 14-4 with the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody asked me if I'd have 10 wins by the All-Star
break,'' said Saberhagen, ``I would have shook my head and told
them, `I can only hope so.' It's been a struggle at times. I've
been one way or another and there hasn't been much in between. But
it was good tonight after the first inning, so I'm very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Expos went down 1-2-3 to open the game, not many
people knew of Saberhagen's concerns. He came out throwing 78
mile-per-hour fastballs and was concerned that something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But he got away with it. In the second inning, he kicked it into
second gear. At the end of his stint, coach Bill Moloney was
clocking Saberhagen at 90-plus m.p.h. Because of his history of
shoulder problems, Saberhagen is on a pitch count. He had thrown 93
through seven innings and that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first inning, I was very cranky on the top of my
shoulder,'' said Saberhagen. ``Moloney had me throwing changeups on
the charts we keep. But after that first inning, I stayed within
myself and hit some spots. I felt a little bit better and my
velocity went up to 92 miles an hour, I guess. I mixed pitches well
and dropped down on a couple. It was fun out there doing a few
different things. (Pitching coach) Joe Kerrigan had a good scouting
report, and I stuck to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen retired 15 of the first 16 batters, allowing only a
fourth-inning single to F.P. Santangelo. In the sixth, he gave up a
home run to Shane Andrews, and in the seventh, Vladimir Guerrero
singled. That was it for Montreal as Saberhagen's ERA dipped from
5.10 to 4.78.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a great first half,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams.
``He's one of the key reasons we've won a lot of games. He competes
with a great work ethic and heart.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time Saberhagen had gone seven innings in
his 16 starts. He was picked up in the last two innings by newcomer
Dario Veras, who was recalled Wednesday from Pawtucket when Rich
Garces went on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really good tonight,'' said Kerrigan, who pointed out
that Saberhagen threw first-pitch strikes to 16 of his 23 batters.
``He had a little rust in the first inning. But after that he was
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's teammates gave him plenty of support, pounding out
12 hits, three by Reggie Jefferson. Nomar Garciaparra had two hits
in extending his hitting streak to 22 games, John Valentin had a
pair of doubles, and Mike Benjamin drove in a pair of runs in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it was a nice night for Saberhagen and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had three guys selected for the All-Star team. That's a
first for any team that I've played on,'' said Saberhagen. ``The
thing that made it more special for me is Flash (Tom Gordon). We've
gone through a lot together. It couldn't happen to a nicer guy. I
was more excited for him than I would if I had made it. He's done a
great job and it's good to see him going to his first All-Star
game.''
</P>
<P>
   With a week off until his next start, Saberhagen is still not
quite satisfied as he prepares to go for his 11th win in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still like to get deeper in the game,'' said Saberhagen.
``I'm still not adjusted to just throwing seven innings. It still
doesn't set well with me. I'd like to go eight or nine innings.
That's my goal for the second half ... a complete game. Hopefully
the shoulder will keep getting stronger.''

Alou, Berry, Bagwell 
lead rout of White Sox
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Moises Alou is not going to hit a home run every game, and the
Astros are not going to score in double figures all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But 3-for-3 isn't too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours after only one Astro was named among the
National League All-Star reserves, the Astros made a statement
Wednesday night with their third consecutive rout of an American
League club, a 10-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The way things have gone the last three games, the Astros might
want to petition a move into the AL. In winning 10 of 13
interleague games so far, they have outscored their opponents 99-40
and have scored 39 runs in their last three games against Cleveland
and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we score 10 runs a game, we will run away with the
division,'' Astros catcher Brad Ausmus said. ``Unfortunately for
us, that's not the way it works. The one through eight spots (in
the batting order) are feeling pretty good at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, selected to the NL All-Star team for the third time
earlier in the day, proved his worthiness by hitting his fourth
home run in three games and driving in four runs as the Astros won
their fourth straight game and extended their lead in the NL
Central to seven games. He hit a two-run double in the first inning
and added a two-run homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a good year, so hopefully things will continue
working for us,'' said Alou, who is 11-for-23 with 12 RBIs over the
last five games. ``It's a matter of staying healthy and lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros may have only two All-Stars _ second baseman Craig
Biggio was picked in fan voting _ but on Wednesday they showed they
are much more than a two-star club.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Berry tied his career high with four hits, including his
sixth home run in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his third homer in two days, a two-run shot in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, snubbed for an All-Star bid for the second time in
his career, went 2-for-5 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez had two hits and drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have four guys that play every day _ Alou, Bell,
Bagwell and Craig Biggio _ and the other guys have to share time,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``It's pretty hard to make the
All-Star team sharing time.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after erupting for 17 runs and 18 hits off Chicago, the
Astros kept up their offensive onslaught off White Sox starter Jim
Parque (2-2), who lasted only four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros built leads of 4-0 and 6-2 before the White Sox
pulled within two runs in the seventh on a solo home run by Charlie
O'Brien and a truly strange play.
</P>
<P>
   Astros reliever Doug Henry threw a wild pitch that bounced into
home-plate umpire Gerry Davis' front shirt pocket, allowing Ray
Durham to score from third while Ausmus searched around home plate
for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds of that?'' Ausmus said of the seventh-inning
play. ``I've seen balls go in people's shirts but never seen them
hit into a pocket. I had no idea where it went. When he said to me
that the run scores, I asked, `What am I supposed to do? Grab you
and throw you in front of the baserunner?'''
</P>
<P>
   Davis himself wasn't immediately aware where the ball hopped to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time anything like that's happened in my 23
years,'' he said. ``No, I didn't know the ball was in my pocket at
first. Then, Henry started yelling, `In his shirt! In his shirt!'
That's when I realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Astros once again made things relatively easy for
their starting pitcher as Pete Schourek (5-5) overcame a pair of
home runs by Chicago. He allowed four runs and eight hits in 6
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek's fifth victory matches his 1997 total. The lefthander
did not allow a Chicago run until the fifth, when pinch hitter Jeff
Abbott doubled and later scored on Mike Caruso's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle trimmed the Astros' lead to 4-2 in the sixth with a
426-foot home run into the rainbow-colored seats in the upper deck
of left field. It was only the 12th homer to reach the upper deck
of the Astrodome, although Mark McGwire accomplished the feat June
18.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros responded in the bottom half of the inning as Berry
hit a solo homer to left and Biggio added a sacrifice fly to push
the Astros' lead back to four runs. Berry also had three singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm back to normal,'' Berry said. ``I've been struggling
the last month and a half. I've been battling away, and I hope to
get a few games like this. And maybe I'll be able to contribute
like everybody thinks I can.''

REVOLUTION STUCK IN REVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After watching his team lose eight
consecutive Major League Soccer games, Revolution coach Thomas
Rongen outlined the things he wanted to see from his team in
Wednesday night's match against the Kansas City Wizards. In a terse
speech to his players at their pregame meal, Rongen used words like
``sacrifice'' and ``hard-nosed play'' and ``concentration'' and
``patience'' as the keys to a desperately-needed victory.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, after the Revolution dropped their ninth in a
row, a 1-0 loss to the Wizards before 5,304 at Arrowhead Stadium,
Rongen must have felt like talking to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure,'' said Rongen, his Dutch humor and sarcastic wit
still intact after the Revolution matched their own MLS record set
last year with nine consecutive losses. ``I have experience. I went
through this last year. It seems like I'm getting accustomed to
this. We've been here before, and we've seen the good side and the
bad side, and we just have to say, `Hey, listen, guys,
unfortunately this is nothing new to us.' We came out of this hole
last year and we've just got to do the same thing this year with a
team I think is remarkably a better team than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Revolution were vastly improved on defense over
their last two losses _ a 4-3 shootout setback against the Dallas
Burn; and a 5-3 loss to the NY/NJ MetroStars. For the better part
of the first 65 minutes, they heeded Rongen's words and submitted a
disciplined effort on defense and exhibited patience in possession
of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But after surrendering nine total goals in those last two
losses, a solitary goal in the 66th minute by Wizards midfielder
Predrag Radosavljevic _ Preki, for short _ was all it took to send
the Revolution (4-12) reeling toward their ninth consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   After hardly breaking a sweat with the US national team at the
World Cup in France, Preki logged a full 90 minutes in his first
game back with the Wizards and, despite being noticeably winded,
summoned enough legs to score the winning goal. After Revolution
goaltender Jeff Causey deflected a right cross by Paul Wright,
Preki swept in and outraced midfielder Ivan McKinley to the rebound
and chipped in a weak grounder from 6 yards out past Manny Motajo,
who had retreated into the net to try and make a desperation save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' said Preki, when it was suggested his
goal didn't rank as one of the prettiest of his MLS career. ``They
all count the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Causey, who ostensibly drew the start when Ian Feuer's wife went
into labor Wednesday, faced six shots on goal and made eight saves
in his first start since last Sept. 9 against the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't that far away from me and he just got a real quick
shot on it,'' Causey said of Wright's shot. ``I knew they had
runners coming through, and (Preki) was just playing breakaway.
Normally, that would be a good save, but he had runners in there.
They were able to follow up and clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was something Wizards goalkeeper Mike Ammann did not allow.
After Preki's score, Ammann, who recorded his fourth shutout of the
season after making six saves and faced nine shots on goal, made a
brilliant stop on a header by Joe-Max Moore in the 71st minute.
Then, with time winding down, Moore caught Ammann off-guard when he
redirected a goal-mouth cross, but Ammann made an off-balance stab
to deflect it over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in this game is very clear, guys,'' said
Rongen. ``We weren't putting our chances away and they get one-half
a chance and they do. That was the difference in the game. We got
five great opportunities, but we ran into a hot goalkeeper and
Ammann made some key saves that great goalkeepers make.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three point-blank shots from about 5-6 yards out,'' he
added, ``I mean, it was incredible. But that's the story for us
right now. We just don't get a break when we need one.''

MALIN LOOKS FOR RESPECT FROM USTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA HADDAD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gene Malin has certainly carved out a nice niche
in life, roving from one private tennis court to another to tutor
young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Lately his occupation has made a turn toward _ dare we say _ the
conventional.
</P>
<P>
   Malin, who lives in West Hills, took over Glenridge Tennis Club,
an exclusive venue in Bel-Air. His days would be ideal if not for
the fact he now must be in charge of a pro shop, organize clinics
and do the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of friends who are disappointed in me,'' Malin
said, jokingly. ``I'm tied down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Malin's daily toil is blissful and low-key.
</P>
<P>
   But July is here, which means the peaceful routine will be
broken, Malin's pride will be tested and some reporter is liable to
ask him about some bitter memories.
</P>
<P>
   Malin on Monday will begin his bid for a fourth championship in
the U.S. Tennis Association National Hardcourt Championship for men
45-and-over at the Westlake Tennis &AMP; Swim Club in Westlake Village.
Malin, who turns 50 in October, is seeded fourth and has won three
of the past five titles.
</P>
<P>
   Seeded No.1 is Wesley Jackson of Albuquerque, N.M., who lost to
Malin two years ago in the final. And there are few people in the
draw that the 6-foot, 188-pound ex-ATP professional hasn't beat.
</P>
<P>
   But Malin takes the court with another opponent in mind: the
USTA. He has always felt unrecognized by his sport's governing body
in America.
</P>
<P>
   The bad feelings started nearly 15 years ago, when Malin led the
U.S. National Men's 35s team to victory in the Italian Cup and got
nothing more than a handshake. And they reached their peak in 1987,
when Malin coached India, led by good friend Vijay Amritraj, to the
final of the Davis Cup, where it lost to Stefan Edberg-led Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite interest from Gordon D. Jorgensen, then president of the
USTA, Malin's services were deemed unnecessary by the U.S. juniors
program.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Malin from enjoying a fine coaching career,
which continues. Among his top students were Kathy May, Stephanie
Rehe and Barbara Potter, all of whom reached the top 15 or better
at one time on the WTA Tour. May was No.8, Rehe 10 and Potter 15.
</P>
<P>
   But with his victories in the national 45s, Malin has developed
a new sore spot toward the USTA. After his first title in 1993,
Malin openly criticized the USTA for not allowing him to play in
high-profile senior tournaments against the likes of former stars
Jimmy Connors and Stan Smith. These were his old contemporaries on
the pro tour, on which he never got higher than 100 in the world
rankings but was able to beat former top-10s Dick Stockton and John
Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   Malin says he'll never see the justification of shutting out a
U.S. national 45s champion, just because people don't recognize his
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to feel that way until the day I die, I think,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who might be Malin's chief rival come Monday, is
clearly on Malin's side in this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be playing at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open,'' said
Jackson, who now runs a motel in Albuquerque after a brief stint on
the world tour. ``A couple years ago, I beat Stockton at the 45s
clays and he won the 45s at the U.S. Open that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say a Jackson or a Malin don't sell tickets like a Borg,
Connors or McEnroe, who are sipping martinis while we're out on the
practice court. The fans just want to see the best tennis possible.
And we want to play these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin, who stands to win a little more than $1,000 if he wins
the 45 hardcourts for the fourth time, has also complained to
Westlake Tennis &AMP; Swim Club owner Jack Darrah about the lack of
prize money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sympathetic to Gene, but he's barking up the wrong tree,''
Darrah said. ``He's always asking me about this, and I don't know
how to make him happy. The truth is, if we charged admission,
nobody would come.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin is likely to remain a powerful serve-and-volleying voice
crying out in the wilderness for compassion until the end of his
playing days. Which are likely to last for sometime. In the coming
weeks, Malin will also compete in the men's 50s national
tournament. And each time he wins, he hopes somebody with a pen and
notepad will be there to record his comments.

M'S OPEN JULY WITH A BANG; GRIFFEY'S 34TH LEADS HR BARRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To get from where they are to where they want to be,
it is going to take the Mariners time, effort, some luck and a
confidence-building stretch of games, a combination that has been
missing for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game is not going to do it,'' first baseman David Segui
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a few more like Wednesday night's powerful 9-5 victory over
the Colorado Rockies at the Kingdome, where Segui hit two home
runs, Ken Griffey Jr. slugged his league-leading 34th and starting
pitcher Ken Cloude ended a two-month winless drought, can only help
reverse an up-til-now dreadful season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have lost confidence in themselves and
forgotten how to win,'' Segui said. ``We have been waiting to lose
instead of doing the things to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Decent pitching. Clutch hitting. And defense.
</P>
<P>
   See how easy it is?
</P>
<P>
   Cloude won his first game since April 24. Segui looked like an
All-Star, although he wasn't selected to the team, Griffey put up
an All-Star performance with three doubles and a home run, and
designated hitter Edgar Martinez slugged a go-ahead homer in the
first inning, leaving the woes of an awful June (8-21) in the
rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to start a new month,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``Let's hope this month treats us better than the month of
June.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey led a 16-hit fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)His three doubles tied a club single-game record.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)He has homered in six of his past eight games, and his 56
extra-base hits lead the majors.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)His 34 homers is a personal career best prior to the
All-Star Game. Only Mark McGwire (37, this season) and Reggie
Jackson (37 in 1969) have hit more.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey had some help. The seven doubles matched a season
high and Segui's two-homer night was the fourth of his career _ and
third this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for us is to come out here and do it again,''
Segui said. ``So many times this year I thought we would (get on a
winning streak), but we came out flat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have won back-to-back games only once since May 29.
Their last three-game ``streak'' was May 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see how we do over a 10- to 15-game stretch,'' Segui
said. ``I don't think anybody in here has given up on the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui's second homer of the game came during an explosive fifth
inning when the Mariners expanded a one-run lead into a five-run
cushion at 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey pushed the rally button with a leadoff double. Martinez
came within a foot or two of hitting his second homer of the game,
but had to settle for a ground-rule double. A fan in right-center
reached between the railing and caught Martinez's drive before it
had a chance to carom off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   An alert first base umpire, Bill Miller, immediately ruled a
ground-rule double. Griffey scored anyway and soon so did Martinez,
on Segui's second homer.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle added another run in the inning as Russ Davis singled
and scored when Glenallen Hill drove a double into the gap in
left-center, also driving Rockies starter Mike Saipe from his
second big-league start.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander received a quick introduction to the majors'
most powerful lineup. After an unearned run gave him Saipe a 1-0
lead in the top of the first inning, Alex Rodriguez singled with
one out, advanced to second on an infield out.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez put Seattle in front with his 13th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's 34th _ a wicked line drive to right field _ came with
Rodriguez aboard in the third inning and, one out later, Segui hit
his first homer of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had seven hits Wednesday before the Rockies had
any, but the four-run lead Cloude carried into the fourth inning
began disappearing the same way it was produced.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado came back with its own power barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla, selected to the National League All-Star team
earlier in the day, pounded his 24th homer of the season into the
right field seats, giving the Rockies their second run and first
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude's lead dwindled to three runs and then one on Todd
Helton's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Helton's 12th of the season and the 17th Cloude has
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Cloude recovered and struck out four of the next five
batters he faced before running into more trouble in the sixth. The
Mariners bullpen, starting with left-hander Greg McCarthy, came to
the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see Ken Cloude win a ballgame,'' Piniella said.
``It has been awhile and we need to get him on a roll. He gave up
some runs but we scored more.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cloude (4-7): ``Hopefully, it's a sign of things to come.
It has been a long time.''

ANGELS LOSE TO GIANTS IN 10 INNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It's something the Angels say they have become used
to, but not necessarily something they are happy about.
</P>
<P>
   Before their 6-3, 10-inning loss to the San Francisco Giants
Wednesday night in front of 24,299 at Edison Field, the Angels
learned which of their players would be participating in next
week's All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   To them, however, what was noteworthy wasn't so much who was
named to the American League team _ first baseman/outfielder Darin
Erstad and pitcher Troy Percival _ but who was left off the team.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, center fielder Jim Edmonds and pitcher
Chuck Finley have been All-Stars in the past, but not this year.
What makes it wrong, the Angels say, is that the club's performance
so far this season is being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   To add injury to insult, Tim Salmon _ already hampered by a
partially torn ligament in his left foot _ was hit on the inside
part of his left knee by a line drive hit by teammate Justin
Baughman. Salmon, who was on third base but standing in foul
territory, was diagnosed with a contusion of the knee. He had the
knee drained after being replaced by a pinch runner.
</P>
<P>
   The two other division leaders in the American League _ the
Yankees and Indians _ have five players each going to the All-Star
game. The Angels, the AL West leaders, have just the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a question,'' Erstad said after being asked if more
Angels deserved to go. ``Ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad and Percival spoke to the media during a news conference
Wednesday afternoon and appeared embarrassed that they were going
without any other teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team deserves to go,'' said Percival, 1-2 with a
2.80 ERA and a major league-leading 25 saves. ``Whether a guy's
hitting .240, we've got guys that grind it out every day. I think
our going is representative of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys we have are grunts,'' he said. ``We don't have flashy
guys like Derek Jeter and Omar Vizquel. We don't have a lot of
pretty players. I think that's a testament to our team. We're in
first place and we don't have six guys on the All-Star team.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty the way the Angels lost Wednesday, either. They
scored two runs in the eighth inning to tie the game at 2, only to
lose it after Bill Mueller hit a three-run homer off losing pitcher
Greg Cadaret (1-2) in the top of the 10th. The Giants added a
fourth run in the inning on J.T. Snow's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Nen (6-1) gave up a run in the 10th but still got the win in
relief for the Giants. Despite the loss, the Angels maintained a
3{-game lead over Texas in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks wouldn't have made a minor league
All-Star team this season, going a combined 0-8 at double-A Midland
and triple-A Vancouver this season before being called up to the
Angels June 15.
</P>
<P>
   But he went into Wednesday's game with three victories in three
starts. He pitched well again against the Giants, giving up two
runs and seven hits in 71/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' only runs off him came on a sacrifice fly by Brent
Mayne in the fifth and a Barry Bonds homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Danny Darwin, however, was just a little bit
better. Darwin shut out the Angels on four hits in 61/3 innings,
getting relief help from John Johnstone, who escaped a
bases-loaded, one-out situation after replacing Darwin in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, tied the game in the eighth on RBI doubles
by Edmonds and Orlando Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, hitting .307 and playing outstanding defense, said he
has no problem being overlooked by AL manager Mike Hargrove for an
All-Star selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking from the shortstop position, if I don't deserve to
make it, I don't think Omar should make it,'' DiSarcina said of the
Indians' shortstop. ``Nomar (Garciaparra of the Red Sox) hands down
is the better shortstop. I understand a manager taking care of his
own players. I have no problem with that. But Nomar should have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds (.307, 14 homers, 48 RBIs) and Finley (8-4, 3.05 ERA)
have put up All-Star numbers, but DiSarcina says a lack of national
recognition exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is something there,'' he said. ``Jimmy's very
deserving, Finley without a doubt is very deserving and you could
make a case for me. But we're not in a big market. We don't get a
lot of publicity. There's a three-hour time change to the East
Coast, so they don't see a lot of our games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of guys hitting .330 every year. We just
have guys grinding every day. Darin, Jimmy, Troy, Chuck have played
like All-Stars every day.''

`FRUGAL GOURMET' AGREES TO SETTLEMENTS IN ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Celebrity chef Jeff Smith, an ex-chaplain who
won national recognition as the Frugal Gourmet on public
television, has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of money to
seven men who say he forced them to have sex with him while they
were teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached quietly this week during out-of-court
negotiations between lawyers for Smith and the men who filed civil
suits against him last year, avoids a messy trial that was to begin
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, host of the most-watched TV cooking show ever and author
of 12 cookbooks that sold an estimated 7 million copies, declined
comment on the settlement when reached at his Pike Place Market
condominium and test kitchen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry. I'm cooking lunch for my staff. Call my lawyer in
Tacoma. Thank you,'' was all the 59-year-old celebrity would say
before hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, through his attorney, has denied any wrongdoing in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges were filed against him in connection with
any of the alleged assaults and the statute of limitations has
expired on all of the alleged incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorney, Ed Winskill, confirmed Wednesday that the case
has been settled. But he would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   F. Mike Shaffer, the Tacoma lawyer who represents the men who
accused Smith of sexually assaulting them, said he will file a
notice today in Pierce County Superior Court, canceling the trial.
Terms of the settlement don't require judicial approval, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer declined to say whether the settlement includes an
apology or admission of wrongdoing by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the men who said they were sexually assaulted by
Smith will receive monetary payments, Shaffer said. ``The terms of
the settlement are confidential. That's all I can say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to one source familiar with the case, Smith had few
personal assets left and the main question in negotiations centered
on the monetary limits of his insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the men had alleged that Smith sexually assaulted them
while they were working for him at the now-defunct Chaplain's
Pantry he owned and operated in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   They contended that in the course of hiring and directing
employees for his restaurant and catering business, Smith pursued a
pattern of grooming high school-age boys for sexual intercourse and
used alcohol, seduction and coercion as part of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh man claimed he was hitch-hiking as a 14-year-old in
Tacoma when, according to the man, Smith picked him up and raped
him in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The men claimed they only became aware of the full extent of
their physical and psychological injuries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement doesn't affect the case of still another man, a
37-year-old Eatonville man who contends Smith coerced him into
having sex and participating in ``sexually oriented parties with
other adult pedophiles and other minor boys'' more than 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Smith's claim was dismissed by a judge in February and
now is under appeal in the state Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Smith, who is not related to Jeff Smith, played a key
role in urging the other alleged victims to step forward and take
legal action against the television chef. Clinton Smith began
contacting the media about his claims in the early 1990s and aired
them on radio talk shows in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Smith alleged that Jeff Smith agreed in 1990 to pay him
and another man $1.5 million each to keep silent about the alleged
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Smith said he was paid $300,000, but the rest was
withheld after an acquaintance told Jeff Smith that Clinton Smith
had talked about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer, the Tacoma attorney representing the seven men who just
settled with Jeff Smith, filed a copy of the purported agreement as
an attachment to lawsuits filed on behalf of those plaintiffs.
However, Winskill, Jeff Smith's attorney, has denied the agreement
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Smith was sentenced to four years in prison in 1981,
partly for stealing money from Jeff Smith's restaurant. At the
time, Clinton Smith said he took the money in retaliation for being
sexually assaulted, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Smith has bitterly contested the allegations made by the
men and the trial was expected to be unusually hard-fought, as have
been the pre-trial battles.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the two sides clashed over the question of
whether Jeff Smith's wife, Patty Smith, should be required to
testify about her husband's sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyers contended that the legal concept of marital
privilege allowed her to refuse to respond to such questions. But
Shaffer contended the court could require her to testify because if
she saw her husband performing a sex act on an employee, she saw
that not as a wife, but as an employee of their business and a
stockholder in their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer contended she shared responsibility for what happened
because, he said, she either knew or should have known about her
husband's sexual misconduct with teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   During pretrial depositions, however, Patty Smith said her
involvement with the restaurant operation was minimal. She said she
made cheesecakes and occasionally did laundry, but was seldom
around the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce County Superior Court Judge Fred Fleming ruled Patty
Smith must answer the questions. But that decision was appealed to
the state Court of Appeals which still had the matter under
consideration when the trial was averted by this week's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Frugal Gourmet appeared on 300 public television stations
and was watched by as many as 15 million viewers at its peak. But
it is seen on only a handful of stations now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ceased feeding the Frugal Gourmet series to local stations
in late December of last year when our rights to the library (of
Frugal Gourmet shows) expired,'' Stu Kantor, communications
director for the Public Broadcasting System in Washington, D.C.,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some local stations still have the rights to air Frugal Gourmet
programs until October and those stations will independently decide
whether to keep running the cooking programs in the wake of the
settlements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that PBS will seek the rights to new Frugal
Gourmet programs in the future, Kantor said. But that's unrelated
to Smith's legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told in January 1996 by the series' producers that
they had no plans to create any new programs,'' Kantor said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's public television station, KCTS/Channel 9, has not
broadcast the Frugal Gourmet for several months. It stopped running
the program when PBS' rights to the program ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not broadcast it for some time and have no plans for
broadcasting it in the future,'' Kay Ingram, KCTS' chief program
executive, said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Smith's Frugal Gourmet cookbooks were published by William
Morrow &AMP; Co., and Avon, book divisions of the Hearst Corporation.
Division spokespersons weren't available for comment last night.
</P>
<P>
   His books, however, have been highly successful in past years.
He was the first cook ever to have two cookbooks on The New York
Times best-seller list at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering the restaurant business and becoming a
television chef and author, Jeff Smith was a chaplain at the
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Ed Penhale and Steve Miletich contributed to this
report.

CLINTON SEES CHINA'S TRADEOFF BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILIN, China _ Here along the banks of the Li River, China's
environmental challenge looms as dramatically as the majestic
limestone formations that soar hundreds of feet into the misty air.
</P>
<P>
   The steep green hillsides overlooking the river's muddy waters
bear the scars of clear cutting as rural villagers harvest the
ancient forests to provide firewood to heat their homes and cook
their meals.
</P>
<P>
   With the forests gone, villagers have been forced to turn to a
new source of fuel. They are using so-called bio-gas _ flammable
methane produced by fetid underground pits of decomposing pig
manure and rice husks and delivered to a kitchen burner by rubber
tubing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came face-to-face with the challenges
afflicting China's peasants Thursday when he visited this
picturesque region and urged China to forego the mistakes of the
West's pollution-producing, 150-year industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chinese environmentalists sympathetic to Clinton's
cause warned that impoverished peasants in the nation of 1.2
billion are willing to inflict further environmental damage on
their polluted homeland if that's what needed to lift their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou Dadi, an expert on energy efficiency and climate change who
serves as director of the Beijing Energy Conservation Center, told
Clinton during a roundtable discussion here that China's rural poor
stubbornly resist their leaders' appeals for anti-pollution
measures.
</P>
<P>
   China's rural villagers say, ```We are moving into your house
and you people come here and live in this forest and see whether
you can stop the logging and have a decent life,''' Zhou told
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged China to take advantage of technological
breakthroughs that are being used in the West to cut pollution or
energy use by vehicles, buildings and factories.
</P>
<P>
   He cited fuel injection vehicle engines that cut energy waste by
80 percent; long-lasting lightbulbs; and the use of wasted heat
from power plants to heat, cool and light public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that China has a unique opportunity _ because you're
developing rapidly but later in time than other countries _ to
avoid some of the terrible mistakes we made,'' Clinton told the
seven environmentalists during a round table discussion that took
place in this one-time communist stronghold during China's civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed China's effort to clean up the Li River to keep
its luster as a tourist attraction that draws 6 million Chinese and
500,000 foreigners each year. He noted that reforestation projects
have sown young pine trees across some of the once-forested
landscape that was denuded by desperate peasants during the
Cultural Revolution in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to join our citizens and our governments, our
businesses and our industries in the fight against pollution and
global warming _ even as we fight for a brighter economic future
for the people of China and the people of the entire world,''
Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution is so prevalent in China that respiratory
illnesses claim more lives than cancer or heart disease. China is
expected to surpass the United States within 20 years as the
world's chief producer of climate-changing greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that Clinton's interaction with
environmental activists was designed in part to highlight citizen
activism.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling environmental movement ``really is a reflection of
the growing sense of citizens being able to be active here,''
explained James Steinberg, deputy national security adviser.
``There is beginning to be a grass roots effort throughout China
which can be a very important factor for change.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stopover gave Clinton a vivid look at the landscape and
meager livelihoods of many Chinese. His motorcade into Guilin swept
past lush green fields of rice being cultivated by bent Chinese
peasants in pointed straw hats.
</P>
<P>
   Water buffaloes grazed on high ground over looking fields
crisscrossed by irrigation canals of muddy green-brown water.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers of limestone, known as karst formations, rose up to 600
feet or more above the fields and nearby tangerine orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy landscape has inspired Chinese poets and ink
paintings for thousands of years. An emperor more than 1,000 years
ago was so awestruck that he proclaimed Guilin ``the first under
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, like tourists before him, boarded a boat to take the
40-mile river cruise down the river to Yangshuo past peaks bearing
legendary names such as Paint Brush Hill, Cock Fighting Hills,
Painted Hill of Nine Horses and the Frog Crossing the River.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: TURN 65, SEE YOUR MEDICAL RIGHTS CURBED
 &HT;    Eds: Adjusts language in 4th graf to clarify rights of seniors
to pay privately.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 5
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By all accounts, President Clinton repeatedly urged
his Chinese hosts to relax their tight grip on the lives of their
people. But back home, when it comes to the rights of Medicare
beneficiaries, Clinton seems more comfortable with the Chinese
Communist model.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that, after you turn 65, your doctor can go to jail for
health care fraud if you decide to sidestep the Medicare
bureaucracy and pay his fee directly.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the vast majority of the 38 million Americans under
Medicare would have scant reason to pay for covered health care
services out of their own pockets. In nearly every case, doctors
accept Medicare reimbursements as payment in full for their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Although seniors can order a physician not to submit their
Medicare claim, for example to protect their privacy, they face the
threat of being denied treatment by a specialist in high demand
even when they are willing to pay privately. While Congress or the
courts may yet return matters to they way they were when Medicare
was enacted in 1965, such choices have been barred since January.
</P>
<P>
   When Medicare officials, acting on their own, put the squeeze on
doctors who billed their Medicare patients directly for services
delivered outside the government-paid insurance plan, Congress
stepped in. The Senate voted 64-35 to uphold such private
contracts, provided safeguards against double billing were in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that some doctors would fill their appointment books
with high-paying seniors at the expense of Medicare beneficiaries,
Clinton reacted by threatening to veto the entire federal budget
unless the proviso was excised.
</P>
<P>
   Thereupon, Congress enacted a so-called compromise that obliges
physicians to opt out of Medicare entirely for two years in order
to enter into even one private patient agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-year exclusion presents your doctor with a very
difficult choice,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said. ``He can either
treat you, his patient of, say, 30 years on a private contract
basis and dump all of his other Medicare patients or refuse to
treat you in favor of his current Medicare patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Since about 96 percent of doctors accept Medicare patients, few
would likely be willing to impose such a hardship on their current
senior rosters. So, as Kyl sees it, the two-year option amounts to
``an almost meaningless choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Tex., are leading the effort to
change the law. Noting that there aren't any such limits under
Medicaid or the health plans that cover federal workers, including
members of Congress, 51 senators have backed a resolution upholding
the right of seniors to contract privately for care.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors who would treat well-off seniors in this way, such
an arrangement would parallel the cost-shifting that is seen in
hospital bills. By accepting higher fees from some seniors, the
doctors could afford to expand the number of lower-fee Medicare
patients they see.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, so far as we know, White House has no plans
ask Congress to bar private markets that accept food stamps from
also selling their goods to shoppers at listed prices. Perhaps that
will make the Chinese leaders take more heed of the blessings that
our free system has to offer.

 &HT;    Ranchers hurt by poor hay crop
 &HT;    By Pamela Coleman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUPLAND, Texas _ Melvin Poldrack loaded up the bed of his
pickup truck this week with tubs of sweet-smelling liquid protein
for his cattle, something he usually doesn't do until winter.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, a hot sun and dry wind have shriveled fields of
grass and stolen most of the year's hay crop, leaving the cattle
dependent on other sources of nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any hay, if you let (the cattle) get in bad shape,
going into the winter your death loss will be great,'' Poldrack
said, watching as 30 or so Simmental cattle gathered around his
truck, parked in a parched field east of Coupland. ``You have two
options _ feed them or sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Agriculture Extension Service, the loss
in hay production this year will cost an estimated $175 million
statewide. A dry spring devastated the early hay crop, preventing
many area farmers and ranchers from making a first baling. The
shortage has ranchers looking to Oklahoma and New Mexico for hay _
an expensive prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find any in the state,'' said Poldrack, 65.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's turned to the liquid protein, whose main
ingredient is cane molasses. But in a field of 30 cattle, one $57
tub will last only a few days. And Poldrack, who runs Poldrack
Grain &AMP; Cattle with his son Terry, has about 2,000 head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something to keep them going,'' he said. ``But it's
more work and more expense.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time of the year, about 50,000 acres of coastal and
other types of high quality hay usually have been baled in
Williamson County, said County Extension Agent Ron Leps. This year,
only about 2,000 or 3,000 acres have been harvested.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that was oat and wheat straw, and that's probably
about as good as a snowball or good for elephant bedding,'' Leps
said. ``It has no nutritional value.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no relief in sight, either. ``With the way the wind
isblowing and hot as it is, I don't see us making a baling of hay
until this fall,'' Leps said.
</P>
<P>
   That means there may be no hay to tide the cattle through the
winter _ unless farmers have it trucked in from other areas or
soaking rains come. And even if the skies open up, the hay problem
won't immediately go away, said Don Kuker, director of livestock
marketing for the Texas Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could rain today really good and there would not be any hay
cut for another 30 days,'' Kuker said. ``And when it was cut, the
people who cut it are not going to sell it, they're going to hang
on to it.''
</P>
<P>
   To put ranchers in touch with hay suppliers, the Texas
Department of Agriculture has set up a hay hotline. More than 100
people a day, most of them looking for hay for their cattle, have
called the line since started Monday, Kuker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most calls we're getting are from southeast of Austin all
the way to northeast Texas,'' Kuker said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a large round bale of hay sells for $25 to $35, Kuker
said. This year they're going for $45 or more _ when they can be
found. Small square bales that normally sell for $2.50 are selling
for $4.50 and up. And while hay is available in parts of New Mexico
and Oklahoma and further north, ranchers must pay about $1.50 a
loaded mile just to have it trucked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of people from the Midwest wanting to sell
hay,'' Kuker said. ``They're overrun with hay. But transportation _
that's the only kicker. The trucking expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers, including Poldrack, are considering mowing down
their cornstalks after harvest and baling them to feed to the
cattle. Most farmers lost most of the corn crop because of the
drought anyway, and they say this is a way to salvage some of that
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a danger in feeding the stunted cornstalks, too. If
the soil was too dry early in the planting season, the corn may
have high nitrate levels, which can poison the cattle, said Dr.
John Reagor, head of department of toxicology at the Texas
Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   He encourages farmers and ranchers to bring forage samples to
laboratories for nitrate analysis before feeding their herds. His
lab tested about 120 samples in the first two weeks of June, and
expects to handle about 400 tests a week before long if the drought
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Schrank, executive director of the Williamson County Farm
Service Agency, said the situation this year is made worse for
ranchers because many of them sold off parts of their herds during
the drought two years ago because they had nothing to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem this year is that they still haven't bought back
all the cattle they sold in 1996,'' Schrank said.

 &HT;    'Armageddon' best American movie of the year
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' is slam-bang sensory overkill. It's loud. It's
heavy-handed. It's melodramatic. It's an explosion of baroque
excess that splats on the screen and bludgeons the audience into a
collective migraine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the best American movie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: In this asteroid-is-coming comic thriller, director
Michael Bay (``The Rock'') demonstrates the euphoric possibilities
of filmmaking. We're not talking about the robust humanism of Elia
Kazan or the experimental elan of Godard. We're talking about
rapturous visual delirium, the mad, pictorial exactitude of John
Woo.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most banal shots are mathematically calculated wonders.
Bay cut his teeth on TV commercials and rock videos, and the scenes
here ooze the syrupy gloss of those huckster mediums. Rock songs by
Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Bon Jovi and Journey _ a roster of tacky '80s
power-pop bands _ underscore several sequences. Nothing could be
more apt for summer blockbusters, the ultimate advertisements. And,
besides, any action flick that can use Curtis Mayfield's
``Pusherman'' tastefully can't be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Bay has a golden eye for riveting composition, and he keeps the
images pulsing with multiple swooshing cameras and crackling
editing. You spin at the sheer artistry, even if you're watching a
simple conversation between two actors. With John Schwartzman's
sumptuous cinematography, ``Armageddon'' is one of the best-looking
movies in a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Taking another cue from Woo, Bay and screenwriters Johnathan
Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams slather on as much cheap emotionalism as
the story can bear before buckling under its overabundance. After
we're numbed by its visceral pounding, the movie finally wants us
to feel. The forced emotional twinges arrive like the faint tingles
in a limb that's fallen asleep. They don't feel right, but they're
still kind of neat-o.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' _ how shall we say it? _ rocks. It is a movie
made by people high on their craft, standing naked on a mountain
top, arms raised to heaven, singing heavy-metal anthems with all
their might.
</P>
<P>
   Such exuberance invites blunders, and the sci-fi romp has its
share. You nearly suffocate on the clamor of the film's finale,
which gives way to bathos that's comical in its Hallmark-ad
gravity. But the sap suits a movie so fueled by gross surplus, in
the same way the maudlin end of Woo's ``Face/Off'' was the only
punctuation mark befitting that grand opera.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the material is surprisingly smart; a hip undercurrent
whips below the film's straight-faced surface. The rote plot _
imminent catastrophe averted by all-American heroes _ is spiked
with keenly funny writing, not just Bruce Willis-ready wisecracks,
and a hugely entertaining ensemble cast that's a fascinating mix of
Hollywood A-listers (Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck) and
quirky indie fixtures (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, who played
the killers in ``Fargo'').
</P>
<P>
   An asteroid the size of Texas is blazing toward Earth, and NASA
has 18 days to stop it. Since blowing up the rock with missiles
would trigger a deadly asteroid shower, NASA decides it must
implode it by jamming a nuke down it. Thornton is superb as the
NASA director who enlists the help of the best deep-core oil
driller in the world (Willis, lending the film muscular thrust).
</P>
<P>
   Willis' Harry Stamper brings with him a motley bunch of
roughneck oil drillers, many of them ex-cons, who wreak hilarious
havoc on NASA decorum. The sequences in which the clownish ensemble
trains for space flight yield huge laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Since we know from the get-go Earth won't be obliterated by the
asteroid, dramatic stakes are provided by a love triangle between
Affleck, his young fiancee Tyler and Tyler's overprotective father
Willis. Willis learns how to be a good dad. Tyler learns how to be
a good daughter. And Affleck scores. There's also some Army vs.
civilian showdowns tossed in, as if our little hearts could take
more pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' piles on the money shots, each one outdoing the
next in spectacle and physical kick. The movie is a 2 1/2 -hour
crescendo. Not a performance fails to entertain, as the characters
grow bigger and fresher and things throttle forth. Scenes of the
group in space trying to harness the asteroid are relentlessly
spectacular. The special effects, especially when Manhattan goes
down like fiery bowling pins, surpass all those blurry effects seen
in recent disaster films.
</P>
<P>
   This is a summer movie after which I might offer the box office
a couple of more bucks in gratitude for such a richly visceral
experience. Exhaustion and exhilaration set in like a hangover, the
cool dividend of massive cinematic drunkenness.
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob
Thornton, Steve Buscemi

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ By all accounts, President Clinton
repeatedly urged his Chinese hosts to relax their tight grip on the
lives of their people. But back home, when it comes to the rights
of Medicare beneficiaries, Clinton seems more comfortable with the
Chinese Communist model. (Glass, Cox News Service)

</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MT. LANIER, Tenn. _ Looking out over the side of
Mt. Lanier down a valley that stretched for miles, the history of

insignificance. It was a meaningful lesson in humility. (Latham,

<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ My wife has a theory about local TV news.
``They're faking witnesses,'' she said. ``Haven't you noticed that
when television reporters go to the scene of a murder, a tornado, a
fire or a wreck on the expressway all the people they interview
look and talk alike? They're all overweight, use terrible English,
wear tank tops and need to wash their hair.'' (Minter, Atlanta

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Declare independence on Independence Day
 &HT;    For immediate release prior to July 4.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advertising types all over the nation have prepared the copy for
their giant Fourth of July sales. We are inundated with newspaper
inserts and television commercials telling us to rush down to this
department store or that appliance store on the Fourth to buy,
purportedly on sale, anything from washing machines and television
sets to brassieres and blue denim jeans.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recall that John Adams said anything about that type of
observance when he read the Declaration of Independence to the
people gathered in Philadelphia in 1776. He talked about pomp and
parades, picnics and games.
</P>
<P>
   When I placed my American flag in its holder on a recent Sunday
_ June 14 was Flag Day, in case you didn't know _ I looked down my
street and saw no flags other than those that represent no country,
no thought _ just pretty design; a pineapple, a sailboat, a doll.
...
</P>
<P>
   So Flag Day is old, forgotten stuff, and the observance of the
Fourth of July centers mainly on giant sales of nothing having to
do with patriotism and everything having to do with the filling of
cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unpatriotic statement when businesses cannot take time
away from those cash registers to observe the most significant of
American holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, half the nation's work force is on the job on the
Fourth of July. Most factories are closed; certainly government
closes down. But not the supermarkets, department and discount
stores and other retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And, like fools, most of the half that isn't working goes to
those stores to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, businesses shut tight on the Fourth and usually
helped sponsor the celebration picnics and fireworks shows for
their employees and families. That spirit somehow gave way to the
craving for money.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, dollar-greedy corporations and merchants are much
like flag burners. They have a constitutional right to be asses.
</P>
<P>
   In my own form of protest, I will avoid shopping at any store on
July 4. I would hope that all of America would boycott businesses
open that day and spend it as it was intended.
</P>
<P>
   The true celebrating of the Fourth takes place in small-town
America where nearly everyone joins in on the observance. In larger
cities, however, it is a different story. Competition is the ruling
factor. If one supermarket opens, than the other feels it needs to
open.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are caught in the middle, faced with irritating their
bosses and perhaps losing their jobs by refusing to work on the
holiday. Union workers probably are in a better position since
holidays and workdays are negotiated, but too many opt for holiday
double time and figuratively trash their flag.
</P>
<P>
   If we're going to be patriotic, or at the very least observant
of what our Founding Fathers intended, then Americans ought to
proclaim their independence from business-as-usual on Independence
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Call the stores that are going to be open and tell them that
unless they begin to free their employees to celebrate the Fourth,
you are going to tear up your credit card, or never patronize them
again.
</P>
<P>
   If you're scheduled to work in a non-essential job, call in sick
or take the day as a vacation day. If you have to go to an open
business, go there as a picketing protester.
</P>
<P>
   American workers should be free to spend the day celebrating
this country with their families. And American shoppers can afford
to take a day off for the same reason.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The side of the barn is safe
 &HT;    (For release July 7, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Lyndon Johnson fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin attack,
I've stopped blindly accepting whatever my government is telling
me. Particularly when it comes to threats against us, and military
success.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in another of what are becoming routine flareups
involving the United States and Iraq, we were informed that an
Iraqi radar locked onto a patrolling British plane over the
southern no-fly zone and that an accompanying American F-16 fired a
missile at the anti-aircraft battery thought to be the source of
the radar lock-on.
</P>
<P>
   Wars of words usually follow these actions, and the Iraqis lost
no time in claiming that the anti-aircraft battery the Americans
supposedly fired at was, instead, a water reservoir. They fished
bits of what they claimed to be the missile from the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   We have a choice here of selecting from two well-known
practitioners of overstatement, the Americans and the Iraqis, and
it's not a pleasant choice to make. Did or did not the missile get
fired at an anti-aircraft battery, and if it did, what was it doing
in the middle of a water reservoir in a demilitarized zone where,
reportedly, there are no military installations?
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time American (and allied) claims of
military strike precision have been challenged. The glowing reports
of missile success against Iraqi targets during the Gulf War lost
much of their gloss when it was later uncovered that much of our
hardware went astray, off course, into things they weren't supposed
to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the delayed news of American troop deaths and
injuries caused by ``friendly fire'' made you begin to wonder who
was at war with whoM.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Arnett, the CNN reporter who visited a bombed target
outside Baghdad during the Gulf War and proclaimed it to be a baby
milk factory, was condemned by many as treasonous. (Arnett isn't
even American; he's a New Zealander.) But you don't hear too many
rebutting his on-the-scene observation any more.
</P>
<P>
   What worries me most about these flareups is not so much the
political twists put on them, usually to place pressure on an enemy
or relieve pressure from the U.S. government, but the fact that our
military strike capability is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   One has only to recall the exuberance in this nation over the
ability of the Patriot anti-missile missiles that we shipped to
Israel to defend it from Iraqi Scud attacks. Never was a weapon so
celebrated since we dropped the nuke on Hiroshima. Later, however,
we discovered the Patriot was a flawed weapon, lacking the speed to
overtake Scud missiles, unable to vaporize them and suffering from
computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   We learned a deadly lesson when the Iraqis sent one into Saudi
Arabia, killing 28 U.S. troops. Belatedly, it was reported that the
Patriot computer would lose track of incoming Scuds if it was
operating for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington may never have told a lie, but he didn't pass
on that virtue to others who followed him into the seat of U.S.
power. I still can't explain to anyone why Ronald Reagan unleashed
an invasion of Grenada, or why George Bush invaded Panama just to
apprehend a drug lord, or why we do so many of the strange things
we do under the guise of defender of human rights, or world
policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Idealism has been swept beneath the floor in many areas of
American life because reality has come along and shown things to be
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   This is very true with American strike capability. We're not the
military surgeons we like to think we are.

 &HT;    What I learned on top of a really big hill
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MT. LANIER, Tenn. _ As I was trying to catch my breath _ surely
the last breath that I would ever breathe _ the man to the right of
me was telling his son that this wasn't really a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   Was he saying that I had pulled myself up on this piece of rock,
20 easy miles by automobile and one hellish half-mile by foot, and
it was just a hill?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really big hill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The guy spoke with one of those foreign accents, you know, Ohio
or somewhere, so I figured that he had seen the Alps or the
Himalayas. I'll grant you, if you are accustomed to Mt. Everest,
the Great Smokeys probably aren't all that great.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, I'll admit that on certain days walking to work I'd
swear I climb several mountains between home and the office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a rock that is more than 6,000 feet tall is not a hill
and I did not name this place Mt. Lanier. If science calls it a
mountain, it is, by golly, a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Being atop a mountain, however, does not lend one to think of
science, though the most practical would consider all of this range
a huge geologic laboratory. You can read the description of how the
Great Smokey Mountain range was formed in the ranger's headquarters
if you so desire. I passed.
</P>
<P>
   Because, looking out over the side of Mt. Lanier down a valley
that stretched for miles, the history of this place did not matter.
It has the power to overwhelm you. Even if you aren't as out of
shape as I am, you'll find it difficult to catch your breath
looking at the panorama. The scene is so spectacular that I found
myself drowning in my own insignificance. It was a meaningful
lesson in humility.
</P>
<P>
   That is when I noticed an area of landslides on an adjacent
mountain. In several places, the terrain became so steep near the
top that the trees had given way. Those trees had knocked down
others and so on for a thousand-foot drop, leaving scars on the
side of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a long time looking at those scars, trying to dissect
exactly how they got there and what they meant before I realized
how typically human I was being.
</P>
<P>
   All of this beauty surrounded me, there to be reveled in, and I
was spending my time analyzing the scars. I had done the same thing
on the half-mile hike up the mountain, rating my fellow hikers as I
am sure they
</P>
<P>
   were rating me (that tubbo is never gonna make it).
</P>
<P>
   What difference does it make what scars or imperfections we
might carry? We're all on the same journey up the mountain. If
someone can't make it, what we ought to be doing is giving them a
helping hand, not judging what caused them to fail. Helping doesn't
mean carrying them on our backs, though we might have to do that
sometimes; often just a word of encouragement is all it takes.
</P>
<P>
   On my way back down the mountain _ oh, yes, down is so much
easier than up _ I told at least a dozen people, ``You're almost
there,'' or ``You've made it more than halfway, you might as well
go the distance,'' or just, ``If I can do it, you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What I got in response was a smile and, in every instance, an
extra spring in their step. Funny thing is, giving that
encouragement helped me as much as it did them.
</P>
<P>
   All mountains have scars. Some are plain for view and some are
hidden by the regrowth of trees. Mountains aren't perfect, but it
doesn't make them any less a mountain. If anything, it gives them
character, something to set them apart.
</P>
<P>
   As we were driving out, making our way closer to sea level, I
noticed that the landslides never occurred on the flatter terrain.
No, it takes a mountain to have a scar _ or at least a really big
hill.

 &HT;    Wrestle with this: TV news is all faked
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ An old farmer friend in our neighborhood
went to his grave absolutely convinced of two things:
</P>
<P>
   1. Neil Armstrong's moon walk was faked in a television studio.
</P>
<P>
   2. Professional wrestling is for real.
</P>
<P>
   While I learned early in life not to doubt the wisdom of old
farmers, I was never quite in agreement. Because of all the changes
in the weather, I'm fairly well convinced we really have been
sending people and other items into space. I've long harbored
nagging doubts about the authenticity of the grunting, groaning and
throwing each other around we see on television from fat
middle-aged men squeezed into bikini trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my skepticism about wrestling stems from an earlier life
as a sportswriter, when I occasionally was dispatched to the old
City Auditorium in Atlanta to cover Friday night matches. The
wrestlers, being hit, and sometimes kicked, in the face, bled
profusely in the ring. When I went backstage to interview them
after they showered and dressed, I was always amazed to notice that
despite all the public bleeding they had no visible cuts or
bruises. Rumors were they used tomato juice, but I wouldn't say one
way or the other. Some people are fast healers.
</P>
<P>
   My doubts were further fueled when I visited the local
promoter's office to interview the White Savage, a crazed ex-Marine
who had been captured in the jungles of Guatemala and brought to
Atlanta in chains to challenge the reigning champion. The White
Savage, after losing his mind on an extended tequila spree and
spending all those years living with wild animals, spoke no
language and ate only raw meat tossed to him from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, including his handler's warnings to
stay out of his reach, I was puzzled by the sunglasses and package
of Camels in his shirt pocket. Otherwise, I've had no reason to
doubt the veracity of professional wrestling until I read the story
about the African-American who is suing promoters because he's
dissatisfied with his ``scripting.'' He claims that because he is
black, promoters refuse to ``script'' him for a championship. I
hate to admit it, but it sounds an awful lot like he's saying the
wrestling we see on TV is not exactly on the up and up. I'm
thankful my farmer friend didn't live to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've never been high on conspiracy theories and
such. A lot of my neighbors think the Braves lose on purpose when
they get ahead in the World Series, just so they can play more
games and make more money. I think they lose because they have such
a sorry bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Until the African-American, who is in a position to know, said
in so many words that professional wrestling is fixed, I had not
worried excessively about what's real and what isn't on television.
I'm the trusting type, and in fact, have been a little embarrassed
by my wife's suspicions about local news.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks a lot of what we see on local television news is
fixed. In fact, she has suggested that I try to do something about
it, after I have fixed a broken door lock, repaired an ailing
air-conditioner, and performed several other chores requiring an
advanced degree from Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could become an investigative journalist and expose what
they're doing,'' she said. ``You could win a Pulitzer Prize and be
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think they're doing?'' I asked. ``I've always
thought television newspeople were honorable folks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're faking witnesses,'' she said. ``Haven't you noticed
that when television reporters go to the scene of a murder, a
tornado, a fire or a wreck on the expressway all the people they
interview look and talk alike? They're all overweight, use terrible
English, wear tank tops and need to wash their hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I said. ``I have sort of noticed that, but I passed it
off to coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that when they interview people involved in
one of the daily pile-ups on I-85 they'd occasionally run into a
doctor, or a lawyer, or an articulate insurance salesman,'' she
said. ``Maybe even a schoolteacher who gets verbs right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like that would happen,'' I agreed. ``But how could
television reporters rushing out to film an expressway pile-up find
people to interview unless they just happened to be there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple enough,'' she replied. ``When they go out on assignment
they take the people they're going to interview with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How would they do that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you seen those panel trucks with the big channel
numbers that show up anywhere something bad happens?'' she asked.
``The things they call mobile units.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' I said. ``That's how the television news teams
transport cameras and communications equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they really have in those vans are the people they
interview when they arrive on the scene,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes some sense,'' I replied. ``Television reporters are
under a lot of deadline pressure. It can be awfully time-consuming
and expensive rounding up brand-new witnesses for every crime and
accident scene in the whole metropolitan area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a central labor pool where all the TV stations send
their trucks every day to pick up the people they're going to
interview,'' she said. ``Take a good look at 6 and 11 o'clock and
tell me if I'm wrong.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: This Fourth of July, think of the
Soviet Union
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Best Fourth of July I remember is the only Fourth of July I
remember crying.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1990. I was in Moscow. This was back when it was still
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been there two weeks, staying with Russian friends in their
cramped little apartment _ this in a complex of buildings dating
back to the 1950s and known as Khrushchev's teeth, yellow and
crooked as they were.
</P>
<P>
   My friends were breaking the law simply by having me as a guest.
Russians were forbidden even from being seen on the street talking
with Westerners. Such were the bad old days of communism.
</P>
<P>
   I'd brought a suitcase full of American cigarettes, the coin of
the Soviet realm. That, too, was illegal _ something on the order
of contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody ever actually smoked them. They were too
valuable. Russians swapped packs of cigarettes for luxuries
available only through the black market. Food, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't buy a beer in Moscow for any price, except at a
small foreign-owned grocery that catered to diplomats and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about exclusive. You had to show an American Express card
to get in the door. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   What I missed most were Cokes over ice. Coca-Colas I could buy
at the diplomat mart. You couldn't find ice anywhere. This in the
country that boasts of Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   But each Fourth of July the U.S. Embassy hosted a celebration at
its country estate, what's called a dacha (rhymes with gotcha.)
Anybody American _ even journalists _ were welcome.
</P>
<P>
   There was baseball, hamburgers, hot dogs, cold beer and, thank
heaven, even Cokes on ice!
</P>
<P>
   Kids were running barefoot. Guys were tossing frisbees. I
remember a pretty lady sitting beneath the shade of a tree, reading
a Danielle Steel novel.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a miracle. It was like America.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Marine color guard marched in, the brass band struck up
``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and everybody stood in reverence as
Old Glory of the United States fluttered in a summer breeze from
atop the flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, half a world away from home, hand over my heart,
the words of the National Anthem on my lips, and tears rolling down
my cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Communism has since disappeared from what was the Soviet Union.
For that matter, so has the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The New Russians _ Yuri the Yuppie, if you will _ drive Jeep
Grand Cherokees, pronounced sure-ROCK-yees.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards advertise Wonder Bras.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a Coca-Cola on most any corner, or coke if that's
what you're into.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So are food stores, with giant neon signs that say ``Food
Stores'' in good ol' American English.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the KGB. Think KFC.
</P>
<P>
   In a way I guess it's a miracle. But it's not America.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to freedom than fast food, fancy cars and franchise

   I'm not sure Russia will ever get it right. But being there all
those years ago taught me a lesson in patriotism I'll never forget.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: UFO studies not a serious line of inquiry
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm afraid no end of mischief will flow from the proposal by a
group of scientists that an ongoing process be set up for examining
of UFO events. If UFO buffs were hard to keep in the woodwork when
science universally scoffed at tales of flying saucers and little
green men, you may be sure they will swarm now that science seems
to have slipped one shoulder strap and winked.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the international panel emphasized it was
issuing no come-hither look to kooks eager for a hot date at the
local polytechnic. There is, its members wrote, no evidence we are
being watched, much less being visited, by space creatures. (They
seem to have overlooked the guests on the Jerry Springer show, but
then alien lore always assumes we could be visited only by beings
of superior intelligence, so perhaps Springer is a false lead after
all.)
</P>
<P>
   Many supposed UFO incidents, the panel says, can be explained by
natural forces like electrical activity high above thunderstorms
and radar ducting (don't ask). Even so, there remains a stubborn
residue of reports that are honestly attested to and that resist
obvious explanation by known natural phenomena. Perhaps, the panel
says, they bear witness to extraordinarily rare natural phenomena
that could be winkled out of hiding by scientific study, and if so,
we presumably would be better off for knowing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, I suppose, but what is to be made of all this by us
folks who are just trying to get safely through life without being
abducted either by space aliens or by university researchers?
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by members of the Society for Scientific
Exploration and was published in the society's Journal for
Scientific Exploration. This may seem a bit incestuous and
suspiciously helpful with peer review, but the involved scientists
carry impressive pedigrees and their society is based at Stanford
University, which is not famous for any institutional whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, riff through the journal's past articles and you find
them busy with water witching, ESP, remote viewing and all the rest
such business. If the journal had a centerfold, you'd expect to
find Shirley MacLaine there, month after month.
</P>
<P>
   These excursions meet the academic sobriety test of dull writing
and la-de-da titles that are meant not to scare off respectable
folk and perhaps even, with luck, tease a grant or two out of
awestruck foundation boards: ``Society and Scientific Anomalies:
Common Knowledge About the Loch Ness Monster,'' is one.
</P>
<P>
   Another explores the ``psychokinetic action of young chicks.''
There was a time when I, too, given my keen scientific curiosity,
was interested in the psychokinetic action of young chicks, but for
some years now my wife has discouraged inquiry along those lines.
</P>
<P>
   Von Eshleman, an expert on the atmosphere of planets and a
co-chairman of the UFO review, was asked whether the report might
invite ridicule. He said, ``We may be opening a Pandora's box of
some kind, but I'm a professor emeritus. I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what to make of that attitude scientifically, but
as I tumble toward my dotage like a satellite that has slipped
orbit, the comment seems wonderfully sane and even sage.

   BOOK-NOTES _ Inspired while watching ``Midnight Run'' on
television one night, Janet Evanovich created Stephanie Plum, a New
Jersey department store lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter. Her
first novel, ``One for the Money,'' sold to the movies for nearly
$1 million, and Evanovich was on her way to becoming a best-selling
author. In Atlanta this week to promote her fourth book, ``Four to

her mysteries with lots of humor. (O'Briant, Atlanta

   AUDIO-POP _ Back in 1980, no one would have lumped Lionel Richie
and Linda Ronstadt into the same category. Today these two are
stuck on the same page of the baby-boomer musical yearbook like a

<P>
   SUMMER-BERRIES _ ORCHARD HILL, Ga. _ One of the surest ways of
telling a city kid from a country kid in the South is to ask
whether he's been blackberrying. City kids may not have heard the
berry used as a verb. Country kids have; they know it means long
pants and long sleeves, stickers and chiggers, inky fingertips and
pails of precious berries that catch the sunlight like cut glass.

SUNDAY, JULY 5. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE-SHORTS _ Sixty years ago when Alice Marble stepped onto
the court at Wimbledon wearing shorts, it was a scandalous thing to

takes some nerve and a good figure to wiggle into a pair. (Johnson,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) NOT FOR USE BEFORE SUNDAY, JULY 5.

 &HT;    Cool picnic ideas for a blazing Fourth
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's a hassle to organize your family and
friends, gather up all that food and navigate the traffic, all the
time knowing it's going to be hot as blazes until the sun goes
down.
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth it. That's why 65,000 to 70,000 locals annually
wind their way to the Auditorium Shores of Town Lake for the Austin
Symphony's Fourth of July celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fun family/friends venue. It's red, white and fireworks.
Food and music, too.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Gunn, whose family has celebrated the Fourth this way for
more than a decade, traditionally spreads her red and white quilt
over the grassy banks and serves a picnic for six to 12 people.
``I've got a sister from North Carolina coming this year, who is
bringing her 12-year-old daughter.'' Add to that her husband, two
grown daughters, and local friends bringing young children, who
always add magic to the evening, and the quilt fills up.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn likes it that way. The best relationships are built around
the dinner table or picnicking on quilts, says the Southern-born
hostess, who, while rearing her children, always kept a picnic
basket packed for impromptu family outings.
</P>
<P>
   Her Fourth of July menu varies each year, with the exception of
the mandatory deviled eggs. This year's spread will include
crudites with tzatziki, marinated beef tenderloin, artichoke-rice
salad and spirited watermelon. All cold. All dishes that can be
prepared ahead. In fact, the salads are better made at least two
days before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn likes to cook and spread a menu of dishes with family
meaning, but other revelers opt for take-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever prepare the food myself,'' says Jeani
Sandefer-Smith, who has been July Fourthpicnicking on Auditorium
Shores since 1976. ``I go to Whole Foods or Central Market and get
cool stuff.'' Melons, Greek salad, shrimp cocktail, tarragon
chicken salad, cold pastas, French bread and always some kind of
sinful individual desserts such as tortes loaded with cherries and
whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   She packs everything in a large ice chest with wheels, attaching
other items to the cooler with a bungee cord so nothing has to be
carried. Arriving at the picnic site about 5:30 p.m. to get her
favorite spot, she puts down a canvas first, then a blanket,
staking the corners with small flags and making it easier for the
dozen or so family and friends to find the spot.
</P>
<P>
   If the summer keeps up its heat wave, there is no question that
it will be a hot time in the old town on July Fourth. But cannons
will boom, as the Symphony's new music director Peter Bay directs
Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Rockets will flare, as fireworks have
their 15 minutes of fame in the Austin skies. And people will oooh
and aahhh.
</P>
<P>
   For Gunn, Sandefer-Smith and thousands of other picnickers, the
patriotic evening will be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>

the plug, reseat plug in melon and refrigerate until ready to
serve. Slice melon as usual to serve or sip juice through straws
sunk into the melon through the rind. Serves 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   Picnic tips
</P>
<P>
   It's gonna be hot, so dress cool in cotton and hats (a must).
</P>
<P>
   Bring sunscreen
</P>
<P>
   For a refreshing touch: Have a clean, damp, chilled washcloth in
a plastic bag, labeled or a different color for each person, to pat
on faces or hands.
</P>
<P>
   Spread a quilt, blanket or throw of some kind to sit on. (If you
have a canvas, spread it first, then the quilt. Sometimes the
ground is damp from watering.)
</P>
<P>
   Bring plenty of water: plain, carbonated or flavored.
</P>
<P>
   Cook or pick up a picnic. But, because of the heat, choose a
cold menu.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a separate cooler for drinks so the one containing
perishable food won't be constantly opened.
</P>
<P>
   Take along a spare trash bag to police your area at evening's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Low chairs provide back support without blocking the view of
others.

 &HT;    As in life, plan ahead
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have seen some curious things on rec.woodworking, the Internet
newsgroup for those involved in our craft. But the following query
is the strangest I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making a simple coat rack with some cutoffs,'' a gentleman
wrote. ``It's the free-standing coat/hat rack kind. I've cut the
legs straight at 45 degree angles on each end. Now I have to attach
them to the post and am wondering what's the best way to do it.
I've thought of a few ways, but none seem that great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any suggestions? I have a drill press, a router (no table), a
benchtop bandsaw and some hand tools.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a great lesson here, and it has nothing to do with how
to connect the legs of a coat rack to the stem. I can only suggest
that it's good this fellow didn't decide to build a boat instead of
a coat rack; he'd probably be asking how he's supposed to get it
out of his basement.
</P>
<P>
   Planning is a wonderful thing in most endeavors, and no less so
in woodworking and furniture making. One simply does not embark on
a project before deciding how everything is going to be done _ and
when. A project's dimensions, among other things, are predicated
upon the joinery.
</P>
<P>
   That's the first thing this fellow has failed to grasp. Another
thing is that for a woodworker of his inexperience, there is no
pretty simple coat rack. Oh, sure, it seems simple at first. After
all, it's just a long stick with some kind of base or legs, isn't
it? Cut a few pieces of wood and there you are.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, there he is, with one long piece of wood and a few
short pieces and not much of an idea what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I happen to have experience with coat racks. I built one
once, for my eldest daughter. Unfortunately it has been a long
time, and she and the coat rack are now in Buffalo, N.Y. I can't
remember the exact way I joined the legs to the upright. Vaguely I
recall it was a fairly fancy joint discovered in a book or
magazine, specific to the joining of coat rack legs.
</P>
<P>
   This fellow doesn't say how many legs he's planning on attaching
_ three or four _ but I suspect it's four. Judging from his list of
equipment, it's unreasonable to expect that he can prepare the
upright to receive three legs, although three would be the more
desirable configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone ask why? Because the tripod is self-leveling. Four
legs may wobble on an uneven surface, but three are not likely to.
</P>
<P>
   On to the joinery. If his dimensions are critical, and one
assumes that since he has cut both ends of the legs to a 45-degree
angle that they are now at those dimensions, then there is only one
feasible method of joining them to the upright. That's with
splines, separately cut slices of wood about a quarter of an inch
thick to be glued into slots in both the leg and the upright.
</P>
<P>
   This may, in fact, be the best practical method he has. The best
way available to him at this point would be sliding dovetails, but
since he has no router table I wouldn't suggest it. Mortise and
tenon, the next best route, is almost as impractical with the
equipment at hand. Next week we'll look at the best way to do it
with the tools he's got.

   A San Diego writer mentioned spending his lunch hour doing Tai
Chi on the roof of his office building, which caused a New Yorker
to wheeze, ``Only in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I harumphed to myself, if more New Yorkers would meditate
on a roof maybe they wouldn't need so many locks on their apartment
doors, be so cynical and think there's nothing worthwhile beyond
the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Some regional stereotypes are like old jokes that hang around
begging for one last laugh. People love to yuk it up over
California, ignoring the fact that people in Cedar Rapids and
Pittsburgh have also discovered tongue studs and self esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, but are their lemon-blueberry muffins dairy-free and
sweetened with honey, and is their soap made from St. John's Wort?
</P>
<P>
   We are a large country and every summer we rush madly back and
forth and up and down to peek into a strange new populace to see
who puts mayonnaise on their burgers and who still thinks gold
chains are hip.
</P>
<P>
   We cross borders and immediately become culture sleuths sniffing
out the tiny differences so we can make or affirm huge
generalizations. Seattle is too Starbucks, the Midwest is too
Penney's, New Mexico is too New Age, Connecticut is too tight. And
none of them has much of a wine selection.
</P>
<P>
   But is it snobbishness or geographical insecurity that drives us
to spend precious vacation time and money ragging on some place
just because it's different from what we've got back home?
</P>
<P>
   I think we really like our differences, especially now that from
sea to sea we all have the same malls, the same fast food chains
and bank at one bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is not on big things, like religious and historical loyalties
that we divide, but on simple choices in tastes and temperament and
whether our women wear jeweled sandals and our men white socks.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are into the summer travel season when it is important to
keep an open mind and remember that we are all emissaries of our
own state as well as guests in another's.
</P>
<P>
   If we can trade tofu for corn dogs and do it without prejudice,
we can show the world how regional peoples can get along.
</P>
<P>
   I helped pass on these differences to the next generation when a
branch of the Massachusetts family recently visited. They were two
California first timers, Laura and Chris.
</P>
<P>
   They attended a Giants game, a rodeo, shopped Haight Street
where the sixth-grader scored 10-inch heels that would make a drag
queen sigh and the eighth-grader a velvet beret that had people
nodding with respect.
</P>
<P>
   They decided they like California, they said, although they
think pizza with pesto sauce is weird and were horrified to
discover that some hot dogs are not made from beef. They split on
the rodeo (one would have been outside with the protesters) but
they both were awed by the giant redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all the souvenir shops and food stands, water rides and
oddnik people they were most impressed with the big trees. Long
after they lose the baseball cap with Orel Hershiser's autograph
and the incense burner, they will dream of trees tall as the sky,
old as the earth, of green light on ferns that look prehistoric.
</P>
<P>
   When someone starts to slam California for considering bicycle
shorts formal wear maybe they will defend us by saying, ``but the
trees out there were made by a wizard.''
</P>
<P>
   We all have to struggle with regional image. Joe, a newspaper
guy in Ohio, says people are always misinterpret-ing his state, and
the worst are the ones who've never been there. I say it's the same
here in wacky California where we all surf and have Baywatch
breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some national politician called Ohio the roast beef state, which
people like Joe don't take as a compliment, knowing how some
outsiders scorn red meat and food that requires gravy. I agreed
with Joe it was a cheap shot. I went to college in Ohio and you
can't beat its hoagies. Besides, in October it smells better than
musk, like no other place.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, while driving through North Carolina, my companion
and I stopped at a roadside market to buy lunch supplies. As he
tells the story, I insulted not only the store, but the town
at-large and probably the whole state by walking into the market
and remarking out loud, ``I wonder if you can get any decent cheese
in this place.'' If I ever run for public office this story will be
used to show I am really Leona Helmsley and not of the common folk
like I pretend to be.
</P>
<P>
   The other night this story of the woman who offended Appalachia
was repeated to our young visitors after they gamely sampled the
guacamole, thereby demonstrating that snootiness does not run in
the family. It's just a California thing.

CONNECTING: A MARRIAGE FOR ALL TO SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday July 9)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an ambitious experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Courant chose one family _ culled from a hundred
who called the paper to volunteer after a request for a ``happily
married couple'' was posted _ to follow for several months in the
course of their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   They selected Tom Kelly and Cynthia Wolcott, a New Britain
couple with four small children.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Anne Farrow and photographer Michael McAndrews spent
about four months with the family, capturing the moments that
define a marriage: a stolen kiss on the couch, a tickle fight with
the boys, a dinnertime confrontation, a rare night out.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a six-day series that ran Feb. 8 to 13, and is
breathtaking in its celebration of the simple daily rituals that
families lovingly conduct behind closed doors, in parks, at bedtime
and mealtime.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early scenes begins in their cozy kitchen in October,
on Cynthia's 40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynthia and Tom, married for 16 years and lovers for two years
before that, are alone at the table with Thomson, their infant.
They have had a glass of red wine with their cake, and seem
contemplative, almost dreamy. It has been a hard year, and they do
not move from this quiet room with its falling light. Tom neatly
spoons beige, macerated fruit into Thomson, a genial, attentive
baby. He so often appears to be following conversations, it is hard
not to invent sentences he might voice, and both his parents do.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrow shows the reader everything.
</P>
<P>
   She reads Tom and Cynthia's mail, relives their courtship,
settles in during the baby's nap time to hear tales from their
shared history.
</P>
<P>
   With the chaos of caring for four children under 6 _ Coleman,
twins Sammie and Atticus and baby Thomson _ Tom and Cynthia
struggle to keep time for themselves and each other.
</P>
<P>
   They struggle to do it the right way: no TV as babysitter,
ragouts of autumn vegetables and homemade cranberry-pear bread for
dinner, paying attention to the other's moods and unspoken needs.
Tom, a salesman of doors, windows and other building supplies,
takes a French course in the evenings; Cynthia, a singer, works
part-time in a library. Their house is often filled with music,
from Tom's acoustic guitar to Etta James on the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the countless, unceasing demands drain them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days earlier, Tom had come home in midafternoon to find
the usually napping Thomson wide awake and roaring, the twins in
Dutch because they had broken a cardinal rule of the household and
awakened the baby with their noisy play, and Cynthia sitting on the
floor of the foyer, weeping with exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   The text is sprinkled with poems about marriage, including this
one by farmer, doctor and poet Wendell Berry:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes our life reminds me
</P>
<P>
   of a forest in which there is a graceful clearing
</P>
<P>
   and in that opening, a house, an orchard and a garden,
</P>
<P>
   comfortable shades and flowers, red and yellow in the sun,
</P>
<P>
   a pattern made in the light for the light to return to.
</P>
<P>
   The forest is mostly dark, its ways to be made anew day after
day,
</P>
<P>
   the dark richer than the light and more blessed
</P>
<P>
   provided we stay brave enough to keep on going in.''
</P>
<P>
   The series reads like a novel, rich in detail, intrigue, even
suspense. How can the portrait of a marriage _ not unlike most,
better than some _ be this complex, this touching, this inspiring?
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the first stories, retold with each person who
enters ``The Country of Marriage,'' as the series is titled.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, Farrow asked the couple why they did it. Although
Tom admitted to knowing ``how the lions feel when the Range Rover
pulls up and the shutters start clicking,'' he saw chronicling a
successful marriage as an endeavor ``full of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Are secrets revealed?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only this, an excerpt from Tom and Cynthia's favorite
poem: ``I love you. I love this fool's walk. The thing we have to
learn is how to walk light.''
</P>

 (Repeating to fix slugline)   (For release Thursday July 9)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A San Diego writer mentioned spending his lunch hour doing Tai
Chi on the roof of his office building, which caused a New Yorker
to wheeze, ``Only in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I harumphed to myself, if more New Yorkers would meditate
on a roof maybe they wouldn't need so many locks on their apartment
doors, be so cynical and think there's nothing worthwhile beyond
the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Some regional stereotypes are like old jokes that hang around
begging for one last laugh. People love to yuk it up over
California, ignoring the fact that people in Cedar Rapids and
Pittsburgh have also discovered tongue studs and self esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, but are their lemon-blueberry muffins dairy-free and
sweetened with honey, and is their soap made from St. John's Wort?
</P>
<P>
   We are a large country and every summer we rush madly back and
forth and up and down to peek into a strange new populace to see
who puts mayonnaise on their burgers and who still thinks gold
chains are hip.
</P>
<P>
   We cross borders and immediately become culture sleuths sniffing
out the tiny differences so we can make or affirm huge
generalizations. Seattle is too Starbucks, the Midwest is too
Penney's, New Mexico is too New Age, Connecticut is too tight. And
none of them has much of a wine selection.
</P>
<P>
   But is it snobbishness or geographical insecurity that drives us
to spend precious vacation time and money ragging on some place
just because it's different from what we've got back home?
</P>
<P>
   I think we really like our differences, especially now that from
sea to sea we all have the same malls, the same fast food chains
and bank at one bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is not on big things, like religious and historical loyalties

   They decided they like California, they said, although they
think pizza with pesto sauce is weird and were horrified to

<P>
   Out of all the souvenir shops and food stands, water rides and

</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON-MAIN

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ From a sparsely-settled rock in the sea to China's
beacon of capitalism, here is Hong Kong's history:
</P>
<P>
   1840-1842 - Opium Spoils. British determination to continue
illegal importation of opium into China leads to the Opium War that
China loses. The Treaty of Nanjing cedes undeveloped Hong Kong
island -- population 6,000 -- to the British.
</P>
<P>
   1843 - New Colony. Hong Kong is proclaimed a British colony and
Sir Henry Pottinger is appointed its first governor.
</P>
<P>
   1859-1860 - Second Opium War. Another bout of hostilities,
spurred by Chinese making a supposedly illegal search for opium on
a British ship, results in Britain taking over the Kowloon
Peninsula across from Hong Kong, under terms of the Beijing
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   July, 1898 - Britain Expands. Britain doubles its Hong Kong area
presence in a negotiated 99-year lease for the New Territories, the
largely empty land extending north from Kowloon. Britain also takes
over 235 islands.
</P>
<P>
   1931-39 - Population Billows. Refugees fleeing Japanese invasion
of mainland China crowd into Hong Kong, where the 1931 population
of 875,000 nearly doubles to about 1.6 million by 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 8, 1941 - Japanese Invade. The same day Japan invades the
United States at Pearl Harbor, it also launches a successful attack
on Hong Kong. After a week of bitter resistance the colony
surrenders. British are interned and many Chinese deported.
</P>
<P>
   1945 - Japanese Depart. Japan loses the war and Hong Kong goes
back to British control.
</P>
<P>
   1948-49 - Flight From Communism. Civil war on the mainland
drives thousands of refugees fearing communist victory over to Hong
Kong. The ultimate success of Mao Tse-tung's forces sends
additional huge waves of anti-communist Chinese from the new
People's Republic of China to the British colony. In 1950 the
population reaches 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   1967 - Revolt Blunted. The mainland's Cultural Revolution brings
Red Guards and street riots to Hong Kong, but British soon clamp
down with tough new restrictions on civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   1972 - China Restakes Claim. Confidence bolstered by joining the
United Nations and re-engaging with America, China begins efforts
to get back prospering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   1982 - British Rethink. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visits
Beijing and explores the role Britain should take when its 99-year
lease expires in 1997 on the New Territories, the bulk of the Hong
Kong colony that is becoming Asia's financial powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   December 19, 1984 - Return Agreed. Negotiations finally produce
the Sino-British Joint Declaration that requires Britain to hand
back the colony of Hong Kong in 1997, while China pledges to permit
civil rights, capitalism and autonomy in everything except defense
and foreign affairs for 50 years. Chinese proclaim this ``one
country, two systems'' pattern can be followed with Macao and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   June, 1989 - Tiananmen Fears. Thousands of Hong Kong Chinese
travel to Beijing to take part in the Tiananmen Square democracy
movement. When tanks crush the student and labor movement, a
million people fearing their future under China come out to protest
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 18, 1995 - In the first and last democratic elections
under British rule, democratic candidates sweep the vote for new
legislature. China vows it will dissolve the body.
</P>
<P>
   December, 1996 - Beijing chooses Hong Kong shipping magnate Tung
Chee-hwa to be the first chief executive of what will be called the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
   July 1, 1997 - Just after midnight, Hong Kong returns to Chinese
rule in handover ceremonies, and within hours troops of China's
People's Liberation Army march into the colony to show who's boss
now.

 CAMBRIDGE: around her.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like her owner, Lucille is rather reserved. She echoes Ms.
Knapp's stillness almost eerily, holding back her more doglike
moments for the three walks the duo take each day. Yes, three.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a lucky girl, she has a compulsive owner,'' Ms. Knapp
said, smiling. ``But we have a nice working routine. It provides
the structured breaks for me in my work. Without her, the only
thing I might ever say is `Large coffee with milk, please,' and
that might be it for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In her relationship with Lucille, Ms. Knapp says, she has
discovered that two unexpected needs of her own have been filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I gave her the childhood I never got, the
attention,'' she said. ``I came from an undemonstrative family. We
were loving in our ways, but we were not a very tactile group and I
find it deeply satisfying to be so. Dogs have such short life
spans, it's like a concentrated version of a human life. When they
get older they become much more like our mothers. They wait for us,
watch out for us, are completely fascinated by everything we do.
So, with her, she's the kid I never got to be and the mother I
never quite had. It's really quite remarkable how much they can
provide without any prompting. It's just built into the species.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Dickinson, Ms. Knapp notes in ``Pack of Two,'' wrote a
letter to a friend in 1862 in which she said of dogs, hers in
particular, ``They are better than human beings because they know
but do not tell.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Ms. Knapp think Lucille knows about her?
</P>
<P>
   ``That she's the one with the biscuits,'' she said without
hesitation. ``Dogs are so immediate. I think she has a good grasp
of my moods, moment to moment. She's good at reading anger,
happiness, sadness and anxiety. I don't know how much further than
that it goes. It's the immediacy of the connection that's paramount
for her.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is paramount for Ms. Knapp? She lit another cigarette.
``I would like a degree of serenity and emotional freedom that
still eludes me somewhat. I am a fairly intense, which is a
euphemism for compulsive and rigid, person. It would be nice to
feel a little easier in the world. It's been six years since my
father died, five since my mother died, and there's a way in which
I'm still sort of reeling from it. I have been sober for almost
four and a half years, and it still feels like I'm reinventing my
life. Living alone, you're the architect of your life in a solitary
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And staying solitary remains her choice. Since ending her
relationship with her boyfriend, she has not started another. She
writes and lives here in this small house on a narrow road. Besides
walking Lucille, she sculls on the Charles River and attends
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up assuming I would get married and have children,''
she said. ``But years pass and you find yourself not doing it and
not doing it, and sometimes you begin to think you may be not doing
it for a reason. I have never felt that deep longing to be pregnant
that I hear other women describe. I melt at puppies, never at
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille started to wake from her nap. Ms. Knapp leaned over to
touch her. ``I guess I resent the idea that nurturing and loving
has to be in human form or childlike form,'' she said. ``It's just
dismissive to suggest it is an inferior set of feelings because
it's directed toward the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``I feel the defensiveness in my voice that this is
`okay' because the `not okay' message is so strong. We live in a
culture that doesn't deal with difficult feelings very well. And
when you're talking about what a solace the dog is in the midst of
painful feelings, people get uneasy. Does that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Once Lucille stretched, she joined Ms. Knapp in
giving her high-10s, touching her paws to Ms. Knapp's palms.
``Excellent,'' Ms. Knapp crooned. ``You're a good girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident called to mind something Ms. Knapp writes about in
her book: the moment at the end of the day when she and Lucille
come home and shut the door behind them. ``It's solitude without
the loneliness,'' Ms. Knapp said. ``I'm shy. I'm still a fearful
person. I've always walked around with the sense that the world is
not a safe place. I didn't get the spontaneous gene or the
adventure one, really. After going through the day with its
stresses, when I shut that door at night, I don't have to deal with
anything but dinner, `E.R.' and my bathrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked lovingly at Lucille, who presented herself to be
petted. ``I get the biggest charge out of ending the day with our
ritual of going up the stairs, and getting into bed,'' Ms. Knapp
said. ``I read, she has her head on my leg or my lap. And I'm in
dog heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Her smile was blissful. Lucille returned her gaze, panting
happily. She seemed to smile, too.

   ------------- Are men worth it? -------------
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale? Do women live better with men or without them, and
which life will be longer, and which will simply SEEM longer?
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York Times, takes a
crack at answering these questions in a fascinating feature titled
``MEN. ARE WOMEN BETTER OFF WITH THEM, OR WITHOUT THEM?'' It is one
of NINE features from WOMEN'S HEALTH, an exclusive special section
from The New York Times that covers a range of health issues and
addresses every stage of a woman's life. The articles _ described

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,
co-author with Lynn Margulis of ``What Is Sex?'' and ``Origins of
Sex: Four Billion Years of Genetic Recombination,'' reports.

</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

members of the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons.
 &UR; By SUSAN GILBERT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

time to organize, or ``unionize,'' the only unorganized part of
medicine _ the patients! _ writes Robert Lipsyte, author of ``In

imperfect union of imperfect people will include the measured

of the teamsters' union under Jimmy Hoffa,'' he writes in this

<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Every day, Marcie Rothman, 51, takes three Body Wise Female
Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22 ingredients
marketed as the natural answer to menopause. And she's not alone.
Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments. But how safe are they? And just how effective? Karen
Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer who is the author of ``To

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,
co-author with Lynn Margulis of ``What Is Sex?'' and ``Origins of
Sex: Four Billion Years of Genetic Recombination,'' reports.

</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In

   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for

AFFABLE SUPERSONIC, 37, AWAITS SHOT AT NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SINGELAIS  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If Sam Perkins' basketball career is over, the
affable giant with the sleepy expression will leave the National
Basketball Association with only one regret. He hasn't played on an
NBA champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing that's keeping me around,'' Perkins said
this week during a high school basketball camp here. ``I've been
close a couple of times. That's the only thing I've wanted _ to
have a ring. If we had won it last year or the year before, I might
have quit a little earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins just completed the 14th season of his NBA career, the
last five with the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   The forward's future is uncertain because his Seattle contract
expired after this season, making Perkins a free agent. Perkins,
37, doesn't know if he fits into the Sonics plans because the
franchise changed coaches after this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westphal replaced George Karl, whom Seattle decided not to
re-sign. The Sonics already have decided not to pick up the
one-year contract option on Perkins' teammate Dale Ellis, who is
also 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met (Westphal) on Sunday, but he didn't tell me anything
sound,'' Perkins said. ``We didn't talk about all the little
intangibles.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters is the NBA lockout that began
Tuesday. League owners want to negotiate a new collective
bargaining agreement with the players. While the lockout is in
effect, Perkins and other free agents are forbidden to negotiate
with any club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm just going to wait and assess everything until the
lockout is lifted,'' Perkins said, adding that he thinks it will
end in September. He doesn't believe predictions that the work
stoppage will last into next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (NBA Commissioner) David Stern's way of letting guys
know that they'd better hurry up and make a decision,'' Perkins
said. ``There's a lot at stake, with players who have to pay their
mortgages and feed their families. But I don't think (the lockout)
will last that long. If it does, I'll be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who is 6-feet-9-inches tall and 260 pounds, indicated
that he would like to return to the NBA next season. However, he
said he would not be satisfied with being a benchwarmer, no matter
what team he's on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about (retiring), too,'' Perkins said. ``I don't
think I will, but if I don't go somewhere that I really like, or if
I don't have a choice, then I probably will go ahead and retire.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Perkins had the lowest scoring average (7.2) and
the lowest rebounding average (3.1) of his career. As he's gotten
older, he has become more apt to linger behind the 3-point line,
shooting jumpers. He made 87 3-pointers last season, almost as many
as he made inside the 3-point arc (109).
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said he wasn't sure if he would accept the league
minimum, which right now is $272,500 per year, in order to keep
playing.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt badly about the departure of George Karl, adding
that it was a clash of personalities with management that led to
Karl's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the things Coach Karl does, he does it like a regular,
normal guy. A beer guy,'' Perkins said. ``Corporate doesn't do
that. That was probably the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Perkins visited the basketball camps that he owns.
He said he's always taken pride in doing the little things that
some other players don't like to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the story of my life,'' he said. ``I don't try to be
the big star or ask for a lot of attention. I just try to stay
within my limitations.''

CHINESE EXILES SEE POSITIVE EFFECTS IN CLINTON VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese exiles and expatriates, whose fortunes rise and fall
with the whims of the Communist Party leadership, are nearly as
pleased as members of the presidential entourage with Bill
Clinton's China trip.
</P>
<P>
   But, they say, it is too soon to conclude that the trip bodes
any deep or lasting change in Chinese domestic politics or in the
US-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin both surpassed exiles'
expectations for the American president's visit to China's capital
_ Clinton with his remarks on human rights, democracy, and the
Tiananmen massacre of 1989 and Jiang with his statement on Tibet
and, especially, his decision to engage Clinton on live television.
</P>
<P>
   However, expectations were low to begin with. Exiles and others
who followed the events closely point out that both political
leaders had much to gain and little to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scratched each other's back,'' said Shen Tong, a veteran
of 1989 democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square. China-US
relations went into a deep chill, and Jiang rose to power, amid the
bloody repression of those protests by the Chinese army. ``Jiang
... gave Clinton big face, and Clinton returned the favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at Tiananmen Square, his saluting the army
there, his tact, and restraint in expressing his differences with
the Chinese leadership are seen by many exiles as pluses for Jiang
in China's domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's allowing Clinton to communicate directly with the
Chinese masses via television, his explicit denial of any Chinese
efforts to influence American elections, and his statements on
Tibet are seen as pluses for Clinton in the US political arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still,'' Shen said, ``I was moved and excited by the whole
thing.'' The widespread sentiment among exiles and expatriates is
that, whatever narrow political agendas may be served, there is
little to criticize about the China trip.
</P>
<P>
   Chai Ling, a top leader of the 1989 demonstrations who has been
living in Boston for five years, said the live television exchange
between the leaders could have occurred only after a debate among
the chiefs of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice of reform succeeded in convincing the rest to let it
proceed,'' Chai said. ``That means very good things about
progressive thinking within the party. This sort of open public
exchange is what'' we ``were requesting nine years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobsang Sangay, a Tibetan activist, said he was surprised by the
prominence accorded Tibet by Clinton, and even more surprised by
Jiang's statements about the central Asian country, which was
conquered by China nearly a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang referred to Tibet before the Chinese takeover as a
theocracy. (The usual Chinese characterization is that it was a
``feudal society.'') He refrained from the usual Chinese charge
that the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, is plotting to split
China. Perhaps most significantly, he demanded only that the Dalai
Lama recognize that Tibet is now an inalienable part of China,
dropping the insistence that it always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were dramatic differences,'' indicating that the level
of hostility has lowered and resolution is more possible, Sangay
said. The Dalai Lama, he said, is willing to forgo struggling for
an independent Tibet now, but has long rejected China's attempts to
repress Tibet's history of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Sangay praised Clinton for referring to the Dalai Lama, during
the live television appearance, as an honest person who is
considered a holy man by many in the West who do not share his
Buddhist faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have some impact, a jolt among the Chinese people,''
Sangay said, because Chinese leaders and media typically refer to
the Dalai Lama as ``a fraud, a liar, a cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese exile Yang Jianli, a doctoral candidate at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government, said the trip has demonstrated
dramatically the effectiveness of democracy in America, and of
pressure in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning'' stages of preparation for the trip, Yang
said, ``I think Clinton would not have said these things. He was
just ... saying that going to Tiananmen Square was a usual thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before he went,'' he continued, ``there was tremendous
pressure from Congress, the American people, and the dissidents in
China. Democracy really works in the United States. The most
important lesson is that pressure really pays off in China. All the
progress in China has been achieved with pressure, not with
appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers share the view of Zhang Nongji, bibliographer of
East Asian legal studies at Harvard Law School, that ``the fact
that there was a live broadcast is very significant, perhaps even
more significant than the content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government should not be afraid of open discussions and
debates,'' said Zhang, who sympathizes with democracy activists but
is neither an exile nor a dissident. ``This was a good experience
for them. It is quite a new thing for the Chinese government. It
shows them that policies can be discussed in front of the people
and nothing will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, she said, Clinton's visit ``will bring some
political and economic outcomes, but the psychological and
ideological influence will last longer.''

   BOSTON _ There was Yon Lee and Wilson Lee, David Lee and Yolanda
Lee, Steven Lee and Dan Lee. There were short Lees and tall Lees,
boisterous and demure Lees, jittery Lees and self-assured Lees.
</P>
<P>
   Big enough to fill a banquet hall, the Lee family descended on
Boston's Chinatown this week for a reunion of roughly 350 members
from across the United States, Canada, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Though they do not all share a bloodline, they share the most
common surname in the world and a familial spirit that has linked
Lees _ in formal associations _ for 122 years.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 100 million Lees worldwide _ including 100,000
in the United States and 5,000 in Greater Boston _ it's quite a
family. The Lees are so numerous they own seven credit union
branches with $22 million in assets and buy buildings that serve as
cultural centers and meeting places in various cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Lees are not immediate relatives,'' said Yon Lee, the
English secretary of the Lee Family Association of New England.
``We follow the Confucius philosophy _ under the family tree, all
people of the same surname, at one time or another, came from the
same forefathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lees say they descended from the ancient philosopher Lao
Tzu, the founder of Taoism, who lived about 2,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The family reunion _ also called a convention, bringing together
``delegates'' from various cities _ is primarily social, but also
includes elections and meetings on fund-raising and launching more
credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever shares the last name of Lee can come _ besides Robert
E. Lee's descendants,'' jokes Steven Lee of San Francisco, the
group's grand national president.
</P>
<P>
   With only 10 delegates, compared to San Francisco's 40, Boston
won the rare opportunity to host this year's convention _ the last
of the millennium, since they're held every three years. Dynasty
restaurant owner Wilson Lee, who heads the New England chapter and
hopes to win election as grand national president at the
convention, excitedly bustled through the banquet, ushering people
to their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the back of a San Francisco store by two Lee brothers
in 1866, the Lee Family Association has sprouted 18 chapters since
then. The Lees have banded together for financial and moral support
and even to generate political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here for 150 years and we're still second-class
citizens,'' said Steven Lee. ``The only way the Chinese can get
more into the mainstream is to get more into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Their best-known relative is Bill Lann Lee, the assistant
attorney general for civil rights who was appointed by President
Clinton late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial assistance is one of the benefits of membership. ``It
helped me when I purchased a restaurant. I went there to borrow
money,'' said Steven Lee.
</P>
<P>
   But the association is best known as a friendly connection in an
unfamiliar place. What began as a support group providing food,
shelter and medical treatment for immigrant laborers facing
hostility and hardship has evolved into a networking group for
immigrant or non-immigrant Lees moving to new locales.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lee, who met his cousin through the association, said his
nephew needed a hand when he came to Harvard University. Steven
Lee's son was at Harvard Medical School and, a few phone calls
later, the sons were linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, a lot of people go to city government for help,''
said Al Lee, who noted the family association provides more
personal aid. ``All you need is to say the name of your village and
they'll know someone from the area.''

EXPATRIATE KOSOVO ALBANIANS PUT MONEY ON WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ As fighting intensifies in Kosovo, ethnic Albanians
from the Serbian province who live in Europe are preparing for war
by sending their savings home to aid the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the rebels fighting for independence against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians in Germany and Switzerland, where most live in
exile, are abandoning hope for a peaceful settlement. Instead, they
getting ready to ``defend their fatherland.'' In recent months,
scores have quit Europe to return home and join the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peaceful means don't work anymore. That's why I went home to
fight,'' Samed Syli, 19, said at a Red Cross counseling session in
Berlin. ``I came back only because my brothers thought one of us
should stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many who have gone to Kosovo to fight,'' said Bujar
Bukoshi, the Kosovo leader who describes himself as the prime
minister in exile, and who now lives in Bonn. ``It's a phenomenon
which is getting bigger every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Kosovo Albanians in particular are contributing large
sums to help the outgunned Kosovo Liberation Army to wage war
against the Serbs. Serbia and Montenegro are the remaining
republics of the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the amount sent from Germany to the group has
shot up from about $5,600 early in June to almost $170,000 later,
said Ibrahim Kelmendi, the director of the ``Fatherland is
Calling'' fund. These numbers could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've saved up a lot of money, and now they are spending
their savings,'' Kelmendi said by telephone from his headquarters
near Bonn, where he runs a group called the Democratic Association
of Albanians in Germany. ``People don't see any way other than
supporting'' the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Kelmendi said the money raised goes directly to the movement,
which he said ``uses it, and I guess they use it to buy weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Kelmendi's fund nor his open support for the Kosovo
Liberation Army necessarily reflects the position of Kosovo
Albanian leaders, who seat a ``government in exile'' in Germany and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other funds are managed by the exiles, headed by
Bukoshi, who was elected in 1992 in a vote that Belgrade refused to
recognize. One need only open the Kosovo Albanian language daily
Rilindja, published in Frankfurt and Zurich, to see a long list of
bank accounts from Denmark to Slovenia to which people can
contribute money.
</P>
<P>
   There is a large refugee and immigrant community, with resources
to tap. Since Milosevic stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1991,
more than 650,000 Kosovo Albanians have fled the province. Human
rights groups charge that the Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province, have been brutally repressed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   About 140,000 Kosovo Albanians have come to Germany seeking
asylum. In all, they say, there are 400,000 in the country. Again,
there is no way to confirm their figures. The Verfassunschutz, the
German intelligence agency that monitors foreign extremist groups
in Berlin, including the Kosovo Albanian community, estimates there
are closer to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bukoshi, who joined Rugova for recent talks with
President Clinton in Washington, will not say if the money he is
raising goes to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``My government is raising money to help Kosovo with all
means,'' he said. ``As to the other, I have no comment.'' According
to Kelmendi, the government-in-exile has raised $112 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most Kosovo Albanians believe that their contributions are going
to the rebels, regardless of which fund to which they contribute.
``I'm sure 100 percent of my money is going'' to the Kosovo
Liberation Army, said Besim Hajdim, a 38-year-old art teacher who
gives $280 a month to a fund based in Switzerland. ``I hope they
use it for weapons. They don't have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing radicalization of Kosovo Albanians here comes while
European countries struggle to decide if the Kosovo Liberation Army
should participate in any negotiations for peace in the province.
Wednesday, Germany was among the first to support the United
States, which has called on diplomats from the six nations
concerned with the Balkans called the Contact Group to negotiate
with Kosovo Liberation Army rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Amid fear that the situation in Kosovo is spiraling out of
control, Germany, France, Britain, the United States, Italy, and
Russia will meet next week in Bonn to discuss the crisis. But these
countries remain divided over what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, dismissed just weeks ago as a band
of disorganized rebels, has seized nearly one-third of Kosovo _
less by military might than by knowledge of the terrain. Its ranks
are increasing with each crackdown by Serbian security forces. But
the group still appears to have no clear leader or defined chain of
command. This makes negotiations with it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Contact Group nations fear that to recognize the
Kosovo Liberation Army will undermine peace efforts by a moderate
Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova. Others, like Turkey,
concerned with its own Kurdish separatists, worry that recognition
would set a precedent and embolden other splinter movements.
</P>
<P>
   There remains the thorny question of how to reconcile the
rebels' aims for independence with European and US support for
Kosovo autonomy instead.
</P>
<P>
   Military options to halt the brutal security crackdowns by
troops and special police forces launched by Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic against the Kosovo Liberation Army have been
drawn up by NATO. They range from the deployment of troops along
key borders to air strikes against selected targets.
</P>
<P>
   But until Western leaders agree on a political strategy for
Kosovo _ and a role in it for the Kosovo Liberation Army _ NATO can
do little. ``The problem isn't on the military side. It's on the
political side,'' a NATO diplomat said in Brussels. ``Are we
dealing with the UCK or not?'' UCK are the Kosovo Albanian initials
for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that tensions in Kosovo are heightening. Clashes that
had been limited to the Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian police
now include civilians on both sides. The Kosovo partisans are
``getting arms to a lot of different villages,'' one Western
diplomat said. ``And there is some indication in the past couple of
days that Serbian civilians have brand new weapons. Overall, the
situation is getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out earlier this year when Milosevic launched a
brutal police assault against the Kosovo Liberation Army. Two major
Serb security sweeps thus far have caused deaths on both sides,
escalated the conflict and wrecked peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bukoshi says he is under increasing pressure from his own
community to send them to fight in Kosovo. ``We see the commitment
of people to defend Kosovo, but we are not organizing such
actions,'' said Bukoshi, who says that he is waiting to hear from
the government in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, about such plans.
</P>
<P>
   But others are sounding the alarm. ``We've been called to fight,
by the radio, by the newspapers,'' said Syli, at the Red Cross
center. ``Every volunteer should come to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, inside the Kosovo Albanian language newspaper Bota Sot
(The World Today) is a notice for a June 30th meeting in the German
town of Hannover. In addition to discussion about the ``current
situation in the Fatherland,'' the ad says that ``the Board of
Associations is calling on all branches in the West to be in
position of readiness to defend the fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Kosovo Albanian Club in the Neukoeln section of
Berlin hangs a massive red banner with a double-faced black eagle,
the flag of Kosovo. While men play chess or table soccer, others
gather to discuss the fighting back home.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all ten people interviewed said they donate between $50
and $170 a month to Kosovo, convinced that the money will be used
either to help refugees or purchase weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for the democratic way of Rugova, but it proved
impossible,'' said Rexer Hoti, 31, a bricklayer from Drenica, a
region in Kosovo where much of the fighting has taken place. ``Now
we have the UCK.''

<P>
   Our new neighbors are driving me crazy. They're the noisiest
family I've ever seen in my life. The kids holler at the top of
their lungs from morning to night, but they don't speak English and
I can't make out whether they're calling for their mother or
raising a ruckus because they're hungry. Their parents, who aren't
there nine-tenths of the time, show up every once in a while and
try to shut them up, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The adults haven't even introduced themselves. In fact, if they
see me coming, they head the other way. It's perfectly clear to me
they're avoiding me, though I pride myself on being a fairly
tolerant neighbor. Their racket carries right into our open bedroom
windows and there's no way I can ignore their constant carryings
on. Anyone with less patience would have called the authorities
long before this. Sometimes when the adults are away, I walk over
to their house, but short of breaking in and doing something about
those kids myself, there's nothing I can do.
</P>
<P>
   I can only hope that when the babies learn to fly, the whole
family of sparrows will abandon their nest in the eaves outside our
bedroom door and peace will reign in this house again.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'm hooked. I peek out from behind the screen
door in our bedroom and watch mom and dad make 90-second pit stops.
I brought my grandchildren out onto the small porch on the second
floor and we stood entranced, listening to the incessant chirping.
I pulled a chair over and let them climb up so that the nest was at
their eye level, but the straw was piled so high in front (to keep
the baby sparrows from falling out, I suppose) that none of us
could see a thing.
</P>
<P>
   I learned as a kid that you must never touch a baby bird because
the mother may then abandon it. Still, the other day my curiosity
got the best of me and I gently poked at the straw with a long
stick. To my surprise it's solid as brick, spun together with a
miraculous super glue made out of sparrow spit. There was no easy
way to push it aside. I really wanted to peek at those babies, but
I restrained myself and went back inside.
</P>
<P>
   They say curiosity killed the cat, but I suspect it's killed
mice and birds and the moles the cat dragged home in far greater
numbers. Human curiosity kills too. Just think of all the shells
with living creatures inside that we haul back from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed a more disturbing example.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I took our kids, then 8 and 10, to visit a farm
in Vermont. We were peering into a rabbit hutch when a family with
a whiny 6-year-old arrived. The child pleaded to hold the rabbit so
the dad hauled one of the bunnies out of the hutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let your daughter hold it,'' I said, stepping forward.
``Rabbits have sharp nails and powerful back feet. She'll only drop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The man ignored me and placed the rabbit in his daughter's arms.
One wriggle and the rabbit was on the ground, hopping away into the
tall grass. A dog suddenly appeared out of nowhere and with one
bite, pierced the rabbit's lungs. Our family stood there, stunned,
as the parents quickly herded the girl back into the car so that
their offspring _ unlike ours _ wouldn't be marked for life by the
sight of an animal's death throes. We had to go to the people in
charge and report the demise of their pet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another story that is almost too awful to believe. Long
after elephant seals were thought to be extinct, a naturalist came
upon a half-dozen of them swimming in some distant cove. Thrilled
with this startling discovery, he killed them all, (he thought),
and brought them back to ``civilization,'' as proof, I suppose, to
be studied, stuffed, and displayed in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   All the little girl wanted was to interact with a small bundle
of fur. The scientist was probably dreaming of educating the
population at large. I'm sure stories like these are the rule
rather than the exception, with man being the proverbial bull in
nature's china shop, but it isn't only out of greed, or
selfishness, or ignorance, that we destroy the living creatures
around us. Ironically, curiosity mixed with affection often has the
same disastrous effect.
</P>
<P>
   I remind myself of that when I'm tempted to intrude upon our
sparrows' lives. I have to accept that my grandkids won't be able
to observe those little open beaks, or count how many sparrows are
chirping their hearts out. I hope, though, that by giving up a
direct encounter with our feathered neighbors, they'll learn a far
more valuable lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes caring about the natural world means letting Mother
Nature care for her own.

HANCOCK REPLACES FUND CHIEF DICARLO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael DiCarlo, one of Boston's brightest investment stars of
the early 1990s, was replaced as the manager of his flagship John
Hancock Special Equities mutual fund yesterday after two years of
poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo, who has managed the $1.5 billion fund for 10 years, is
known for investing aggressively in small stocks with big
expectations for growth. He stuck with that ``momentum'' style even
though it fell dramatically out of stock market fashion in recent
years and his fund dropped far behind the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock Special Equities, which gained an astounding 84.49
percent in 1991 and 50.44 percent in 1995, has returned a total of
1 percent in the two years ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally accept it and totally understand their decision,''
said DiCarlo. ``The group of stocks come in and go out of favor.
There's nothing I can do about that.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo left John Hancock in 1996, perhaps at the height of his
popularity, to form a new firm to operate a hedge fund, DFS
Advisors. But he signed a contract to remain an independent manager
of his old Hancock fund for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Though DiCarlo and Hancock said they reached a mutual decision
on the change Wednesday, performance benchmarks in their agreements
gave the company the ability to switch managers. Hancock could make
a change if the fund underperformed the growth stock component of
the Russell 2000 index for a two-year period. The contract DiCarlo
signed with Hancock when he left the company reached its two-year
anniversary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Equities fund lost 6.81 percent annually over a
two-year period ended May 31, and ranked in the worst 2 percent of
funds in its category, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
The Russell 2000 Growth benchmark earned 4.69 percent annually
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly because I've managed the fund for 10 years,''
said DiCarlo. ``But these things happen, I see it happen all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Management of the Special Equities fund was turned over to Laura
J. Allen, who worked at Wellington Management Co. for 17 years
before joining Hancock in March.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock officials said they were disappointed to replace DiCarlo
but believed performance of Special Equities in recent years
demanded a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have relatives who are in the fund and I get beat up by
them,'' said Edward Boudreau, chief executive of John Hancock
Funds. ``The performance was disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo was by far the biggest draw for Hancock funds for years.
His Special Equities fund was temporarily closed twice, in 1993 and
1994, because money flooded in faster than he could put it to work
in small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   His performance soared or muddled along on the performance of
go-go stocks like America Online Inc., which remains the
portfolio's biggest investment today.
</P>
<P>
   Special Equities, which invested nearly $2.2 billion at its
peak, has been slowly shrinking through shareholder redemptions for
most of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo said he would focus his attention exclusively on his
hedge fund _ a private vehicle for wealthy investors. He declined
to say how the hedge has performed in the last two years.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
More on Hancock
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;  Not long ago we wrote about our ``Boston Plan,'' an idea to put
together two or three of the city's big financial players into a
behemoth that could survive in a world where only the biggest need
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the American Banker reported that John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Co. had held informal merger talks with BankBoston
Corp. and Fleet Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said the Boston insurer
was eyeing a deal around the time of its demutualization and
initial public offering, expected late next year.
</P>
<P>
   The story is baloney, Hancock said flatly Wednesday. ``The
company is not for sale and there are no merger talks. There is no
truth to it at all,'' said Hancock's president, David D'Alessandro.
``We are going through a demutualization. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fleet and BankBoston declined to comment.

 &UR;  &LR; John O'Connor, managing partner for the Boston operations of
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand since 1996, has been appointed office managing
partner for the merged PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was also named US Northeast region leader for the
firm's Assured and Business Advisory Services. The new firm was
created by the merger between Coopers and Price Waterhouse
announced last September. The Boston office of the combined firms
will have more than 2,400 employees, including 190 partners.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First, let's define our terms: Exterior walls means walls of
the room with the great outdoors on the other side of them.
Interior walls means walls of the room with another part of the
housoe on the other side of them. The problem is on the inside of
the exterior walls; the side facing the room.
</P>
<P>
   That done, now for the explanation: Those exterior walls are
cold because the house is not insulated, and water vapor condenses
on them more readily than the warmer, interior walls. It is this
condensing water vapor (water) that is causing the peeling of both
paint and paper. Sometimes the moisture gets behind the paint and
paper, pushing everything right off. That is obvious. What is not
obvious is why other exterior walls in the house don't have similar
problems. They may be warmer for some reason, but since they do not
have the problem, they don't need fixing.
</P>
<P>
   So, one cure is to insulate the house walls. Since the house is
brick, the insulation should be installed from the inside; holes
are drilled in the wall and the insulation blown to the wall cavity
through those holes. This will keep the wall warmer, and water
vapor is less likely to condense on it. Those holes must be patched
and plastered over after insulation is installed, which is a pain
but necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Then, scrape and sand off loose paint and repaint with two thin
coats of a latex wall paint. As for papering, put it up with a
vinyl paste, which is more resistant to water than any other kind
of paste.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am buying a house with 2 x 3 studs against the concrete
foundation, with friction-fit insulation between the studs. I know
there should be a plastic vapor barrier on the wall, but where
should it go: in front of or in back of the insulation?
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS CLANCY, Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Any vapor barrier _ plastic, paper, or foil _ always goes on
the wall facing the basement, or in the words of insulators, facing
the heated part of the room. Put the plastic on the face of the
studs, so that when it is installed and you are in the room looking
at the wall, you will see the plastic. Cover the plastic with
plasterboard or any other wall finish such as paneling, and you
will be done with that wall.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 x 3s instead of 2 x 4s are OK, because a room below grade
does not need as much insulation as a wall above ground.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I notice your warning against using wood filler on outside
trim. I presume it means that the filler might melt outdoors. I
filled splits in a rake board (exterior trim) with a wood filler
that I think is interior grade. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   JOE JOYCE, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Apply a coat of paint or stain and hope for the best.
Properly covered, the interior filler will be protected for as long
as the paint and/or stain stands up. As for future filling of
holes, use an exterior wood filler.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have peculiar stains on the concrete apron around my indoor
pool. They could be algae or a fungus of some kind, but they are
brownish cream and about the size of a quarter. I tried
full-strength bleach and Triple Action20, which did no good. How
can I remove the stains, and with luck, keep them from coming back?
</P>
<P>
   BILL JABLONSKI, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They may be stains from leaves and other organic matter left
on the concrete for too long a time. But why they are quarter-size
is a stumper. At any rate, try this: Sand the stains with coarse
sandpaper and, if they come off, seal all the concrete with a
masonry sealer or a semitranparent stain. The sealer should be
renewed once a year, while the semitransparent stain may last and
be an effective sealer for three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the idea of sanding concrete, then try
muriatic acid and water. The acid attacks lime in the concrete,
which may remove the stains. Then seal the concrete. Mix equal
parts acid and water, and always pour the acid into the water. Wear
skin and eye protection _ and extra care _ when working with
bleach.

AMERICA CAN LEARN IMPORTANT LESSONS FROM CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fresh from his tour of China, President Clinton
can return home with valuable lessons that could improve the
quality of life for families in America.
</P>
<P>
   We have much to learn from China. Unlike many government
officials in America, their counterparts in China recognize and
acknowledge their problems and have a plan for addressing them.
</P>
<P>
   There is a palpable national commitment to, and momentum toward,
transforming the educational system. This is manifest in the pride
and enthusiasm of the students, the diligence and dedication of the
teachers and the creativity and flexibility of school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   I spent two weeks in China in April as a part of a delegation
sponsored by the San Francisco-based United States-China
Educational Institute. It coordinates exchanges between health and
education officials in the respective countries as a way of
improving public policies for families and promoting international
understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that all is not perfect in China, and that I only saw
a portion of the full picture. It is very hard, however, to
fabricate intelligence, commitment and curiosity. I can say with
complete conviction that there is genuine enthusiasm and innovation
occurring at the local level in China.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, government bureaucracy results in safe thinking and
cautious thinking. I was startled by the incredible intellectual
dynamism and genuine curiosity of what, in this country, would be
middle-level bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   As one elementary school principal told me, ``We don't care
where the ideas come from. We just want to do what works.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has to constantly fight for government resources
for politically powerless children, I was astounded to witness the
level of public investment in programs and facilities for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Palace in Shanghai is a newly constructed,
state-of-the-art building that provides a wide range of cultural
and artistic classes.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods have after-school Juvenile Science and Technology
Centers where students conduct science experiments and explore
applications of technology.
</P>
<P>
   There is an air of innovation in the realm of education. The
Sichuan Normal University faculty members coordinate research with
the public schools so that the solutions they explore will be
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the faculty produces more than 400 research papers
examining problems in education. Given the common challenges of
youth development, our nation would be enriched by learning from
their research _ and they by sharing ours.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should establish the relationships and build the bridges
that can connect the most innovative thinkers in China with
policy-makers in America.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the San Francisco school district, we will be trying to
improve the quality of education by working with the United
States-China Educational Institute to develop partnerships and
exchanges between educators in San Francisco and China.
</P>
<P>
   While China has its problems, so do we, and we should exercise
restraint in issuing condemnations lest we appear inconsistent, or,
even hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all the acrimony about China becoming the next ``enemy''
is the fact that the Chinese are one-fourth of humanity with whom
we share a very real bond.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear of the threat the Chinese pose to national security,
I can't help remembering that the worst terrorist bomb this country
has ever suffered was from within, at the hands of an American in
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In protecting ourselves and in moving forward, the most
important steps we can take are toward building trust, partnership
and collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that Clinton's visit will determine not only what we can
control but also what we have to learn.

WOMEN SHOULD LET THE SPORTS WORLD DEAL WITH TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The score is 46-38, in case anyone is counting.
The National Organization for Women should be, but it doesn't know
how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson served 38 months for rape. He did his time, but NOW
wants him banned from boxing indefinitely. Next week will be the
one-year anniversary of the date he had his license to do business
in the ring revoked for nibbling on Evander Holyfield's ear. Tyson
can apply for reinstatement then, and NOW plans to protest his
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The group should take its signs and shoe leather elsewhere, to
Phoenix, where a federal judge handed down a 46-month sentence
against the man who arranged a point-shaving scheme at Arizona
State. The judge, Robert Broomfield, called sports part of the
``fabric of this country'' when he gave Benny Silman four months
more prison time than the prosecutors had requested.
</P>
<P>
   Interfere with the final score of a basketball game. Get 46
months, federal time, which means little chance for parole. Rape a
woman. Go free eight months sooner.
</P>
<P>
   There's no point anymore in debating whether Tyson should have
spent more time behind bars. There's even less point in trying to
keep him out of the ring. Boxing rejected him only because he
violated its fraternal canons. If his ban is extended, it will be
out of respect for the Marquess of Queensberry, not a woman's right
to say no.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way it should be. The last thing we need is the
Nevada Gaming Commission passing judgment on anything of real
importance.
</P>
<P>
   That job really belongs to Broomfield, who seems dangerously
preoccupied with the trivial. If he truly understood the value of
sports, he would have kicked the case out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal charges misdirect public outrage, turning athletic
effort into a measure of citizenship. Let the National Collegiate
Athletic Association sue Silman for undermining its product. Let
Arizona State demand its scholarship money back from the two
players who confessed to shaving points. But leave the feds out of
it.
</P>
<P>
   These cases squander taxpayer money and, ultimately, protect
only the sanctity of gambling _ the Justice Department keeping the
collegians in line for the Vegas oddsmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everything gets warped. An athlete commits a rape or
beats up his girlfriend, and he thinks a .300 batting average
offers redemption. That's why NOW goes after Tyson. His boxing fame
survived his prison term, remained part of the ``fabric of this
country'' and netted him a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But the women's groups should leave him alone. The people who
pay Tyson, who make money off of him, the people who watch him _
they're not going to listen to NOW. They've already made up their
minds, and they care a lot more about Iron Mike than Citizen Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   He finally offended them last year by messing with the sport.
That's when they started calling him a savage. For years, they paid
him to bash men's skulls. Then they turned on him for chewing on a
bit of cartilage and prematurely terminating their $59.95
pay-per-view show.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the best thing NOW could do is petition the gaming
commission to return his license. As long as he's fighting, Tyson
will be subject to constant scrutiny. The ring is the only place
where blinkered sports fans will ever hold him accountable.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, too, that he can never be a great boxer again,
that sports won't reward self-destructive people for very long. His
ear-bite was an admission that he couldn't beat Holyfield fairly.
If he comes back to the ring, Tyson will have to show that he can
still fight or that he can go down with some dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he will probably have to call on the resources of a
mature adult. In obscurity, he's less likely to have that sort of
reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   In football, Lawrence Phillips is in a similar spot. He beat up
his ex-girlfriend in college, scaling a three-story apartment
building at 5 in the morning to reach her. He knew that if he hurt
her, he could be kicked off the Nebraska team, but he did it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Purist football fans argued that this incident shouldn't
interrupt his career. They forgot how tough the game really is. In
the National Football League, Phillips continued to get into legal
trouble, and he couldn't gain much yardage, either. That happens to
athletes who can't keep their eye on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Phillips was accused of hitting a woman who refused
to dance with him in a bar. If it turns out that he is guilty, the
Miami Dolphins might give up on him. NOW will be happy, but the
Dolphins will only pretend that they care about that. They will be
more worried that Phillips lacks the proper discipline and respect
for coach Jimmy Johnson and that, as a result, he will gain about
35 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   The sports world usually polices itself that way. Most of the
major leagues test for cocaine on the pretext that they want to
present role models to the public. What they really want is
athletes who aren't too high to get to practice on time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly justice, but sports obsession leads to all
sorts of craziness. And until someone shaves a lot of points off
that 46-38 score, it will have to do.

BACK TO BASICS FOR ANNE KLEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Face it. Ever since Anne Klein's money men got
rid of Louis dell'Olio for not being relevant enough to the
so-called ``modern'' woman, the company has not fared too well.
</P>
<P>
   Dell'Olio, who was Donna Karan's design partner at Anne Klein
when the original Anne died of cancer, was replaced by the hip
Richard Tyler, who cut his clothes so narrow that he lost Klein a
lot of its classic customers. He, in turn, was replaced by Patrick
Robinson, who fared even worse. And now, with two new designers,
Ken Kaufman and Isaac Franco, Anne Klein is back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, Klein is coming out with a new ad campaign and
two designers who refer to dell'Olio with every stroke of the
chalk. The Anne Klein II line now becomes Anne Klein, a bridge line
to compete head-to-head with DKNY, Ellen Tracy and Dana Buchman.
And the A-Line still skews younger and slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   To announce the change, Anne Klein is showing its clothing on
non-models _ 30 multigenerational, multiracial women who, says
Laura Wenke, senior vice president of marketing and communications,
``Ken and Isaac and our committee felt should be our customers and
whose talents they admire. They were chosen as much for what they
didn't have in common, for their diversity, as well as their
general spirit of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from Annie Leibovitz's stunning gatefold tableaux
for Vanity Fair's Hollywood issue, Klein hired Leibovitz to shoot
the finalists _ women from the age of 24 to former Texas Gov. Ann
Richards (no age given) who could afford the time to go to New York
to be photographed and who could wear the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's ``Significant Women'' campaign kicks off in the August
issue of Elle and is said to cost in the $5 million range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, these ads have got to be about the clothes,''
Wenke says. ``There is nothing cutting-edge about them. They are
collectibles, basics. But they are classics given a fashionable
twist. The fabrics are all state of the art. You'll see a lot of
bi-stretch wools.''
</P>
<P>
   The new designers, Wenke says, ``cut rather generously. Their
silhouettes are more forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Significant'' women in the campaign are dressed in the
fall line, which is very New York, very urban, ``very urbane,''
Wenke says. The line is a collector's dream: turtlenecks and
blazers (albeit very nipped-in-waist blazers that fondle the body);
crisp, white, tailored shirts and stylish menswear gray coats
(Richards looks particularly fetching in that one); very, very
sophisticated black evening wear; leather jackets; blanket-fringed
sarongs; silver anoraks and camel corduroy suits. All of it: a
vindication of dell'Olio's classicism.

A GREAT READ ON EASY LISTENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using no fewer than 60 contributors from all over the United
States and Europe, Steve Knopper has put together the most readable
and informative reference book on pop singing in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``MusicHound Lounge: The Essential Album Guide to Martini Music
and Easy Listening'' (Visible Ink Press, Detroit, 1998; 590 pages;
$24.95) isn't some cold, fact-spewing dictionary or an over-the-top
compendium of personal favorites.
</P>
<P>
   This is an insightful look at the careers, best and worst
albums, the influences and legacies of 500 lounge and
easy-listening singers from Abba to Zamfir, a category generously
defined to include the likes of Mose Allison, Teresa Brewer, Cab
Calloway, Sinead O'Connor, Elvis Costello, Gordon Lightfoot, Denny
McLain, Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Elvis
Presley and Tom Waits.
</P>
<P>
   From the front of the book, a foreword by Martin Denny of
``Quiet Village'' fame, to the back, a ``Welcome to the Ultra
Lounge'' sample CD, Knopper's pacing is a pure delight.
</P>
<P>
   Denny writes, ``I started out playing piano in bars, ranging
from a lounge in Eureka, California, to the Surf Room of the Royal
Hawaiian Hotel in Honolulu. In 1957, I performed with my group at
Las Vegas' Flamingo Hotel, on an elevated circular stage that
revolved like a merry-go-round. ... In the background you could
hear the clinking of glasses and the noise of bartenders blending
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ultra-Lounge'' CD has 24 fine cuts, including ``Mr.
Lucky'' from Si Zentner; a medley of ``One Step Beyond'' and ``The
Twilight Zone'' from the Ventures; Nelson Riddle's ``My Three
Sons'' theme; Billy May doing ``The Look of Love''; Peggy Lee's
version of ``The Boy From Ipanema''; Bobby Darin's ``Charade'';
Dinah Washington, ``Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?''; Martin
Denny's ``Cool'' from West Side Story; ``Balinese Bongos'' from Les
Baxter; ``Squatty Roo,'' the John Buzon Trio; and Al Caiola sliding
between ``Big Noise From Winetka'' and ``Midnight Swim.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a look-see at each artist's career, followed by
recommendations of which albums to buy first, which to buy next and
which to avoid, page after page highlighted by rich photographs and
Cocktail Classics, pop boxes listing the best and worst renditions
of a given song.
</P>
<P>
   Knopper's lounge music falls into three main categories _
``Crooners,'' ``Space-age bachelor pad music'' and ``Elevator
music.''
</P>
<P>
   To Knopper, the editor of the book, lounge music ``refers to a
place where people gather to hear music and drink martinis, not a
style. ... In the end, `MusicHound Lounge' is simply a book of good
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``MusicHound has a bit of junkyard dog in it, too,'' Knopper
adds. ``It likes to start fights.''
</P>
<P>
   There may, indeed, be fights over certain sections. Julie
Andrews is given more space than June Christy and Richard Harris
gets as much play as Phil Harris, which is crazy. And they like Jim
Nabors a lot more than is good for them.
</P>
<P>
   But if some of the choices in ``Lounge'' aren't choice, the
writing is solid all the way through. Here, for instance, is a
slice of Cab Calloway, written by David Menconi, music critic for
the News &AMP; Observer out of Raleigh, N.C.:
</P>
<P>
   ``If more people were as purely entertaining as Calloway, the
world would be a much better (not to mention hipper) place.
Calloway was the key transitional figure during the 1930s and
1940s, when the big band era was giving way to R&AMP;B. He was there to
goose it along every step of the way with acrobatic performances
that predated Jackie Wilson and James Brown by decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Or here's Knopper on Rosemary Clooney: ``Because she was a
straightforward pop singer instead of a rock 'n' roll belter or a
jazz chanteuse, Clooney's incredible hitmaking career is frequently
dismissed by critics and historians with their noses upturned. Yes,
she sang many novelty tunes, including the surprisingly forceful
and sexy `Mambo Italiano' ... but, while she doesn't communicate
with quite the expression of Billie Holiday, Clooney's clear,
perfect voice is a marvel.''
</P>
<P>
   From its descriptions of Frank Sinatra (``the model of all
things lounge'') and Lonnie Donegan (``undisputed King of
Skiffle'') to casual facts like the crew of the space shuttle
Challenger asking that their wake-up call on April 6, 1983, be
``Teach Me Tiger'' by Nino Tempo and April Stevens, ``MusicHound
Lounge'' bursts with good bits.
</P>
<P>
   Add dozens of Cocktail Classics and it just gets better. The
18-carat ``Volare'' belongs to Dean Martin. The ``Bombsville''
version? Alex Chilton. ``Thunderball?'' Tom Jones at ``18-Carat,''
Xavier Cugat at ``Bombsville.'' ``Nature Boy,'' best version? Nat
King Cole. Worst? The Association. ``Let's Call the Whole Thing

   For a lot of entries, the tongue of ``Lounge'' is way back in
its cheek. The Jerry Vale essay starts with, ``All right, so he's
not Al Martino.'' The one on Frankie Yankovic says, ``When you
think of Christmas ... you probably don't think of polka. Well, all
that will change the minute you buy the delightful `Christmas
Memories.''' Bobby Darin's biography includes the fact that he
believed so strongly in the heartbreak of his album, ``Born: Walden
Robert Cosotto,'' that ``he refused to wear his toupee while
recording it.''

hospital's 2,600 emergency calls last year. More often, patients
arrive at the low-slung brick building with snake bites, allergic
reactions or broken bones. But her survival illustrates how
important a hospital can be to the people living in a rural
community. In Jasper County, that role is in danger. Across the
country, hospitals in rural communities are finding it increasingly
difficult to stay in business, and Jasper County Memorial is no
exception. (Carr, Cox News Service 850&AMP;add.)

 &HT;    CHINA TRIUMPH BEHIND HIM, CLINTON FACES TOUGHER FIGHTS AT HOME
 &HT;    1050&AMP;add. For release Sunday, July 5
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Still dealing with jet lag after a nine-day China
tour, President Clinton returns to the Oval Office on Monday to
face partisan squabbles and policy headaches that may well leave
him nostalgic for the Middle Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Awed by ancient wonders, inspired by the promise of change and
buoyed by having carried a message of freedom and hope to 1.2
billion Chinese, Clinton would like to use the momentum of his
historic state visit to help reinvigorate a troubled domestic
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But as he tries to advance a slate of bread-and-butter issues
ranging from child care tax credits to a minimum wage increase,
Clinton returns to a White House under siege by influences largely
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress is spoiling for showdowns over tax
cuts, education spending and health care to help highlight their
political differences with Democrats before November, when all 435
members of the House and a third of the Senate will be up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a long list of foreign policy matters demands
Clinton's attention. They include ethnic fighting in the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, the continuing economic crisis in
Asia and the growing risk of instability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's inquiry, now in
its sixth month, into whether Clinton had an affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky then later urged her to lie
about it under oath, allegations the president has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all that the coming dog days of August _when Congress
will be in recess for almost the entire month _ and it's clear it
won't be easy for Clinton to translate his China successes into
political victories at home. He could be hard-pressed to simply
keep his domestic objectives alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll come back reinvigorated,'' said analyst Erwin Hargrove,
who teaches political science at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, but in trying to score points domestically, ''foreign
trips don't help much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly lifted by his China tour, which gave him
unexpected opportunities to showcase his rhetorical gifts before
the largest audience in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So remarkable were Clinton's performances during a
nationally-televised press conference from Beijing with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, a televised give-and-take with students at
Beijing University and a live radio call-in show in Shanghai that
even some of his harshest critics were forced to acknowledge his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if you reach out to a billion people and talk about
open markets and expand the zone of freedom on the planet, that's a
pretty good investment for the world,'' House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., said Wednesday at a Republican Party fund-raising
event in San Antonio. As an advocate for increased liberties for
the repressed Chinese, Gingrich said, Clinton did a ''good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Praising Clinton, however, seems an easy habit to break in this
town, particularly for Republicans fighting to maintain control of
both houses of Congress come Nov. 3. Many will try to do so largely
by differentiating themselves from Clinton's priorities, beginning
as soon as the Senate returns from its mid-summer break on Monday,
and the House on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to cooperate (with Clinton) on anything,''
predicted Hargrove, author of the just-published book ''The
President as Leader: Appealing to the Better Angels of our
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the political firmament, at least, it's a season when halos
are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists, as well as many Republicans, were
stunned last month when Senate Republicans killed an omnibus
tobacco bill that would have raised cigarette taxes by some $60
billion a year and hit the industry with comprehensive regulations
aimed at ending marketing efforts that target teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was counting on the increased revenues to fund at least
a third of his proposals for beefing up Head Start preschool
programs for poor children, increasing child care subsidies for
low-income families and expanding medical research, among other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to use the cash to finance a new cut in
the capital gains tax on profits from the sale of property, stocks
or other investments, as well as tax-free savings accounts of up to
$2,000 a year to fund a child's education.
</P>
<P>
   With or without a tobacco bill _ the House is working on a
stripped-down version _ Clinton still wants his spending increases,
and Republicans still want their tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has opposed both the proposed tax cuts _ he could be
forced into a veto showdown as early as this week over the
education savings accounts, proposed by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
_ saying the breaks favor wealthy Americans over low-income and
middle-class workers and threaten efforts to keep the federal
budget in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years into the greatest U.S. economic expansion in
history, the federal government is only now beginning to balance
its budget, after three decades of deficit spending that has left
the country $5.5 trillion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Before rushing to cut taxes, Clinton insists, any surplus
revenues _ projected to top $40 billion this year _ should be set
aside to help shore up Social Security. The national retirement
insurance program will begin paying out more than it takes in when
Baby Boomers begin leaving the workforce in the year 2010, and its
reserves could be depleted by 2032 under current projections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to avoid politicizing the explosive issue between
now and Election Day, and has proposed taking it up as a national
priority early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, have asked him to
name a bipartisan commission to make recommendations much sooner, a
plan Clinton has thus far resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Even without control of Congress, Clinton is hardly without
resources on Capitol Hill. Much as he went around China's
repressive leadership in Beijing to take his message directly to
the people of China, he's been formidably effective at taking his
campaign directly to the American people, 61 percent of whom still
regard him favorably, according to a June 7 Gallup/CNN/USA Today
poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the best features of the presidency is the bully
pulpit,'' White House political counselor Paul Begala said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of this year will be either progress or
partisanship, and that really is up to the Republican leadership,''
said Begala. ''I think they're going to either move on the
president's agenda or wish to goodness they had, come November.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Political equations aside, Clinton also faces the prospect of a
deepening security crisis in Kosovo, a province of what's left of
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, whose troops have waged a months-long
campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians, who make up 95
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts, yet to bear
fruit, to negotiate peace, even as NATO members move forward with
contingency plans to use military force if necessary to prevent the
conflict from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces other international challenges, including trying
to prevent the troubles in Asia from dragging down the global
economy, struggling to breathe life into the staggering Middle East
peace process and helping to prevent the Russian economy from going
down the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional challenges and international ills are not unique
to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidents are never in control of their own agenda,'' said
Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center. ''Seldom in American
history have presidents dominated the Congress and, especially in
periods of divided government, it's always a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has to deal with that others haven't, though, is
the daily deluge of proceedings and pronouncements from Starr's
investigation, which has generated thousands of hours of television
commentary, acres of newsprint and a sprawling scandal that has
distanced Clinton from the news media, throttling one engine of
influence he had formerly used to great effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question but that his position is dramatically
weaker now than it was at the beginning of January,'' said Mann.
''This whole Lewinsky-Starr matter has certainly hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's own image took a hit last week, when U.S. District Judge
James Robertson threw out tax evasion charges Starr had filed
against longtime Clinton friend and former Associate Attorney
General Webster Hubbell, claiming that Starr had exceeded his
authority and violated previous immunity guarantees granted to
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a Clinton appointee, railed at Starr, accusing him of
using his subpoena power to pry documents from Hubbell as part of
''a quintessential fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling gave teeth to the claims of Clinton defenders such as
Begala, who have long maintained that Starr's investigation is less
about justice than about derailing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the goal, maybe the entire goal, is to distract him,''
said Begala, who insisted that he and his White House colleagues
have been ''roped off'' from the Lewinsky matter and are focused on
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm not going to lie to you, it certainly can be
distracting,'' Begala said. ''It's maybe a sad commentary, but one
thing we've become quite good at is this phrase,
'compartmentalizing, carry on regardless.' We've got vast
experience with that.''

HOLLYWOOD BOWL MOMENTS GET UNDER WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; John Mauceri is having a Lucille Ball moment.
He's used to them by now. Like knee-high corn in Iowa, or
baseball's all-star break, they crop up around the Fourth of July,
a sure sign that summer is under way and the Hollywood Bowl season
is about to begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they occur around the time Mauceri and his family check
into their Laurel Canyon house _ their summer home away from home
for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Then come staff meetings, a careful study of orchestral
arrangements and a tight 1{ days of rehearsals before Mauceri picks
up the baton again _ as he will at 7:30 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a sitcom in a way, because it's a new season and you
enter the house and all the characters are back,'' says the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra's principal conductor, shaking off jet lag
from an all-day flight from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one time I met Lucille Ball, she said the hardest part of
doing `I Love Lucy' was that she opened the door and it was the
same set (every episode), only she had different lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``there's a comfort,'' Mauceri says, in working year after
year with a highly talented group of musicians, at what is arguably
America's most famous outdoor concert venue. If summering at the
Bowl has become a routine for Mauceri, it's clearly one he
welcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were created, a lot of people thought it was going to
be this pickup orchestra with a rotating-door policy,'' he says.
``Nothing could be further from the truth. But nonetheless, even
though you're among family, you're still starting from scratch
every week.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to summon music from the ground up helps explain why
the Hollywood Bowl, now in its 77th year, has become an L.A.
seasonal fixture.
</P>
<P>
   From its leisurely beginnings in 1922 _ seven years before the
famous art deco band shell was added _ the Bowl has been a place
where culture happens casually. Where winter at the Music Center
means to stir the soul, summer at the Bowl aims to lift the
spirits. Where the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is candelabra and
strong coffee, the Bowl is fireflies and champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are certain constants at the Bowl, such as the
fireworks displays at Friday and Saturday performances, and the
familiar white jackets worn by members of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, the Bowl's other principal tenant.
</P>
<P>
   And you always can count on perennials such as Beethoven's
``Fifth Symphony'' and John Williams' Night at the Movies to poke
their heads through the soil.
</P>
<P>
   But like a Dodger pitcher on opening day, Mauceri likes to throw
out a few new wrinkles every season. This year's Bowl lineup offers
a typically mixed bag of classical, jazz, opera and popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it should be, says singer-actress Della Reese, star
of TV's ``Touched by an Angel,'' who will be the featured soloist
in three Fourth of July weekend concerts, tonight through Sunday.
Reese will perform a new song of her own, ``Touched by an Angel,''
plus patriotic standards such as ``America the Beautiful,'' ``We
Shall Overcome'' and Aaron Copland's ``Lincoln Portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement for me comes with the people,'' Reese says
jovially. ``I don't care if it (the concert) is in a cardboard box.
This is not to underplay the importance of the Hollywood Bowl, but
this is about being with the people _ when I get with the people,
and I get that thang going with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his appointment as the newly formed orchestra's leader in
1991, Mauceri's ``thang'' has been to advocate new orchestral
works, American music of all stripes, and new arrangements that
plumb musical insights from old chestnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the season's novelties will be the L.A. premiere of Paul
McCartney's symphonic poem ``Standing Stone.'' The July 19 concert
will be dedicated to Linda McCartney, late wife of the former
Beatles member, and its text will be read by Gloria Stuart, the
genteel actress who played the elderly version of Kate Winslett's
character in ``Titantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he heard ``Standing Stone,'' Mauceri says, ``I
really wasn't sure it was a good work. But like any work that takes
a long time to perform, you have to give it its time. You have to
give a Mahler symphony its time; it's not a three-minute song. I
think that the work is important enough for us to bring it to our
public and make it serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Both at home and abroad, Mauceri has endeavored to punch through
the wall between classical and popular music. His advocacy of
Hollywood film music is perhaps the most visible way he has steered
the Bowl from its traditional diet of German Romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the Bowl's appeal also appears to be a top priority
of L.A. Philharmonic executive vice president and managing director
Willem Wijnbergen, who succeeded Ernest Fleischmann earlier this
year. In April, Wijnbergen took over management of the Bowl,
leaving its previous manager, Anne Parsons, in charge of the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Wijnbergen described the moves as
``preliminary steps in a process aimed toward further expanding the
Hollywood Bowl audience, as well as improving the overall quality
of the Bowl experience.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's unclear what Wijnbergen has in mind, it's probably
safe to bet that next July 4, Mauceri and company will be back
playing the same lump-in-the-throat music that still gets to
audiences _ and even some performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been all over the world many times, and I was rehearsing
`America the Beautiful' and it almost brought me to tears,'' says
Reese. ``I can't really explain it any better, this surge in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark it down as one of those Hollywood Bowl thangs.

CLOONEY GETTING THE RIGHT BREAKS, BUT NOT RIGHT MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ George Clooney has not made a bad choice when it
comes to his film career. But up until ``Out of Sight,'' he had not
made a good movie, either.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his decisions and try to separate them from the
results. ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' the schtizoid vampire comedy, put
Clooney on the movie map in 1996 after years of TV grunt work. It
was a clinker, but it was a start, too. Next up was a romantic
comedy with Michelle Pfeiffer _ never a bad proposition _ unless
the movie was ``One Fine Day,'' a predictable piece of fluff that
never found an audience during the busy Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year came ``Batman and Robin,'' a chance to step into the
lucrative cartoon movie franchise, followed by ``The Peacemaker,''
the first movie ever released by DreamWorks SKG. Both were great
picks; both were anathema to critics and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody blamed Clooney _ completely, at least _ for these movies.
The perception was that he was better than the work, a thought
neatly encapsuled by ``Out of Sight'' screenwriter Scott Frank who
bluntly said, ``George has a Steve McQueen thing going. But he
needs the right material _ he's got to stop doing `Peacemaker.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney laughs when appraised of the comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I have a framed letter from Steven Spielberg saying,
`Here's our first film for DreamWorks. Do you want to do it?' Like
I'm going to say no to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All those movies were good breaks, especially considering
where I was coming from,'' Clooney continues. ```Batman' was a huge
break. And, well, that franchise is buried now. I won't be doing
that again. The other movies all fell a little short, and, yeah, if
I had been better, they probably would have been better, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, 37, was determined not to make any apologies for his
next movie. He spent nine months reading scripts _ at an average of
five screenplays a week _ and turning them all down before he came
across Frank's adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel, Out of
Sight.
</P>
<P>
   The character-driven story of a bank robber named Jack Foley who
becomes irresistibly drawn to the female federal marshal (played by
Jennifer Lopez) pursuing him had Clooney hooked after he read just
four pages. That's when he called a friend and shouted into the
phone receiver, ``I found it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even need to finish it because I've been a fan of
Elmore Leonard since reading 52 Pick-Up years ago,'' Clooney says.
``I would never be so arrogant as to say that any movie could
improve one of Dutch's books, but this one gets things right.
People were telling me that I seemed so natural I must have been
improvising, but I didn't change one line in Scott Frank's script.
I just read the words, man. This is a guy who really gets what
Dutch is doing in his books.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have agreed, calling ``Out of Sight'' one the year's
best films. And audiences have responded, too, showing up in
healthy numbers for a modestly-budgeted movie that's competing for
attention in a summer filled with mind-numbing, effects-driven
films where the dialogue is typically drowned out by the
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is expecting this movie to make a billion dollars,''
Clooney says. ``We'd just like to get some good word-of-mouth and
hang around for a while. I tell you, though, it's awfully nice
sitting here talking to you about a movie that I can unabashedly
say I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney also has high praise for director Steven Soderbergh, who
had been on a losing streak of his own since making a big splash at
the Sundance Film Festival in 1989 with his first film, ``sex, lies
and videotape.'' And it's not just the typical actor gushing about
his director so he can promote his new movie. Clooney and
Soderbergh enjoyed working together enough to want to do it again
and are developing ``Leatherheads,'' a film about the early days of
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked George, but in a lot of his movies he's just
always moving so fast and he came across like mercury,'' Soderbergh
says. ``What I wanted to do was simplify his acting and make him
still. George can be still and be compelling, but it's hard for a
lot of actors to believe that. They think they have to tart up the
scene. He didn't have to do that here, though, because this film
has such great dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Clooney: ``If you look at what Steven does with this movie,
you can see why I want to work with him again. It's the little
touches like the freeze frames that highlight an important moment
in Jack Foley's life. Or the way he cross-cuts the love scene
between Jennifer Lopez and myself. He makes interesting, informed
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney says he would like to make another Elmore Leonard movie,
and he's angling to see what the Coen brothers are thinking about
doing with their upcoming adaptation of the author's latest book,
the Spanish-American War story Cuba Libre. Clooney thinks it might
be a hard sell, though, not seeing himself as the kind of actor the
Coens typically use in their films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might try to con Elmore into calling them for me,'' Clooney
says with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like he needs the work. Clooney hasn't quit his day job
_ yet _ and will soon be returning to the set of ``ER,'' for the
fifth season of the nation's most popular television series. He has
said for some time that this will be his final year on the program,
but he is also leaving the door open for guest appearances in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed a five-year contract and I will have honored it,''
Clooney says. ``What I'll probably miss most is not doing 11 pages
a day, which is a lot of work, but it makes the days fly by. And
working so fast, you only get a couple of cracks at it. So if you
don't get it, too bad. They'll print it. It's a nice incentive to
be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney has a $23 million deal with Warner Bros. to develop
films during the next five years and he already has a few dozen
projects in the pipeline. Movie audiences will see him next,
though, in a 20th Century Fox film, ``The Thin Red Line,'' the war
film that marks director Terrence Malick's long-awaited return to
movie-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a small part,'' Clooney says, dismissing his role
when compared to friend Sean Penn's. ``I just did it because
`Badlands' (Malick's first movie) is one of my all-time favorite
films.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell,'' Clooney continues, ``I would have showed up just to
carry the hammer box, you know? I just wanted to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like another good choice to us.

THOMAS THROWS DEBUT INTO DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mellow rocker Scott Thomas says he sequenced his
debut disc ``as a soundtrack for driving.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you can't listen to the Scott Thomas Band's
``California'' (Elektra/EEG) at home or elsewhere. But the
singer-guitarist says he especially likes ``road trip records''
that can be played from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story should start when you turn on the ignition and then
be good to the last drop,'' Thomas explained. ``When I got ready to
put the finishing touches on the album, I got in the car and drove
along Mulholland Drive into Calabasas and along Pacific Coast
Highway and figured out what order I'd like to hear the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was just 15 when he left home in Northern California and
moved to Los Angeles. By the mid-'90s, he was performing his songs
at the Hollywood club Largo, where he met the musicians who would
become the Scott Thomas Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played every Tuesday night, always sitting down,'' Thomas
recalled. ``We never stood up. Our chairs would be almost at
audience level.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's haunting single, ``Black Valentine,'' was recently
among the top 30 songs at rock radio across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas lives in Laurel Canyon but spends a good deal of time in
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shop there,'' he said. ``That's where my video store is. I
rehearse in the Valley. The Valley has the folk-rock vibe.
Hollywood's gotten to be such a weird place.''
</P>
<P>
   BLACK SHEEP: No Depression: Is it a magazine, a book, a roots
music scene or a way of life?
</P>
<P>
   All of the above, says Peter Blackstock, co-editor with Grant
Alden of ``No Depression: An Introduction to Alternative Country
Music (Whatever That Is)'' (Dowling Press; $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   The softback anthology collects pieces from No Depression
magazine, launched three years ago by Alden and Texas-bred
Blackstock, Seattle writers tired of that city's grunge scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us were fans of these artists and we were certainly
into a lot of independent and underground stuff in the '80s,''
Blackstock said. ``Like a lot of our readers, we found ourselves
appreciating roots music as we got older and punk-rock got co-opted
by the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   The book highlights 35 artists, including Son Volt, 16
Horsepower, Steve Earle, Whiskeytown, Waylon Jennings, Gillian
Welch, the Jayhawks and Charlie Louvin, people ``too old, too loud
or too eccentric for country radio,'' Blackstock said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MUSIC: Coming next month are new albums from Senegal's Baaba
Maal and Jamaican guitar pioneer Ernest Ranglin. Maal's ``Nomad
Soul'' and Ranglin's ``In Search of the Lost Riddim'' are the first
two releases from Palm Pictures, Island Records founder Chris
Blackwell's new entertainment company.

MTV LENDS HAND TO IDOL PURSUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Buddy Eason was at work at the Guitar Center in
Sherman Oaks when a camera crew burst through the door.
</P>
<P>
   It was MTV and they were gunning for him.
</P>
<P>
   Eason, 23, had been chosen for MTV's new Monday-night show
``Fanatic,'' where fans are given a chance to interview their
favorite stars.
</P>
<P>
   Eason, who also lives in Sherman Oaks, hung out with his fave
band, Huntington Beach thrash-metal outfit Korn, at a recording
studio in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're everyday people,'' he said. ``I found out they're just
like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. Maybe that close identification isn't exactly what MTV _
or Korn _ had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, stars already hooked up with their No. 1 fans for
the show include Jennifer Love Hewitt, the Wallflowers, Boyz II
Men, Wesley Snipes, Backstreet Boys, Cindy Crawford, Eddie Van
Halen and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very lengthy screening process,'' explained ``Fanatic''
co-executive producer Ed Connelly. ``We search for the biggest fan
through the Internet, then they send tapes and we decide who is the
most inspired and devoted fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are asked to make a video about their life and
send it to the show's producers. Post-``Truman Show'' attempts to
falsify daily existence will be spotted immediately, MTV promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for the person who has the most healthy interest in
the celebrity,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   We suppose that might rule out John Hinckley Jr. meeting Jodie
Foster. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fan is chosen, MTV works with an accomplice to make the
announcement a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the camera crew came to burst through the Guitar
Center's doors in search of Eason, who said he really hit it off
with the members of Korn and promised he wouldn't stand around
outside their homes on evenings and weekends and days when Guitar
Center lets him off early.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any moment, an MTV crew could come and pluck them from
their lives and 24 hours later they're meeting the celebrity,''
said Deborah Norton, another ``Fanatic'' co-executive producer.
``Some of the more dramatic moments occur when the fan actually
tells the celebrity what they inspire. It's interesting when the
fan and celebrity connect on a human level.''
</P>
<P>
   That proverbial human level. Much better than two people
connecting on the canine level. Somehow, we can't imagine dog
friendship rituals playing on TV, even the cable channel that
brings us ``Road Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanatic,'' which features two celebrities and fans per show,
premieres at 11 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MTV has traveled great distances to tape the first 20 episodes.
To meet Snipes, his fan was flown to Saudi Arabia, while another
went to London to greet Willis.
</P>
<P>
   We're not sure if this is because the celeb was actually running
away from the fan or they just happened to be in those faraway
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities get nervous about things like this, but this is
such a controlled, highly screened situation,'' Connelly said.
``It's really a once-in-a-lifetime thing for fans to connect with
their heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Van Halen, the fan not only got to meet the band,
but was invited on stage to perform with the rockers. Now, that's a
career in need of some serious re-evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had this dream-come-true quality,'' said Norton, speaking
either about Van Halen or the kid. Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   Celebs from all fields, including sports, politics, music and
film will be booked,'' Connelly said, adding that he has even
considered booking ex-Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the most worrying question for parents and
employers of potential ``Fanatics'': How you gonna keep 'em down on
the farm once they've met Dan Quayle? &UR;

   $ADV05  AS ELECTIONS NEAR, CONGRESS
MEMBERS AWAIT INTEREST GROUPS' REPORT CARDS
 &HT;     For release Sunday, July 5.
 &HT;     By KIMBERLY MARSELAS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's report card time again _ not for students, but
for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are issued by nearly 100 special interest groups from
across the political spectrum. And with congressional elections
less than four months away, lawmakers are paying close attention to
their grades and what they mean to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an election year, it's difficult to find very many people
who say they are for destroying the environment or building up the
deficit,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. ``Voters sometimes
will rely on some kind of independent verification to discern the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, voters for whom abortion is a key issue can track
ratings by the National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion
group, or the National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League,
which favors abortion rights. Similarly, gun control legislation is
tracked by both the National Rifle Association and Handgun Control
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Most groups grade members according to how they voted on bills
the group considered important. But once compiled, the report cards
are used in ways as varied as the groups that issue them.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups tell lawmakers in advance that certain votes will be
graded, hoping to sway their votes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
uses its report card in the re-election campaigns of low-scoring
lawmakers, distributing copies to its 1,700 local branches and 1
million members. The Concord Coalition, an anti-deficit group,
sends its grades to all the members of Congress and any of its own
members who request copies.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition follows pro-family votes and distributes
lawmakers' rankings to its members, lawmakers and grassroots
activists. The American Conservative Union uses its report card to
select lawmakers that its political action committee (PAC) will
support with campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a guide to determine what the ideology of a
member is,'' explained Tom Katina, executive director of the ACU.
``We're not partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow who specializes in governmental
studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
facility, agreed: ``They're not partisan, but they're certainly not
non-ideological.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Vote Smart, an independent organization that tracks
interest group report cards on its Internet site
(http://www.vote-smart.org), warns that the ratings can be biased,
favoring one political party over another.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, shares the concern about bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most members (of Congress) are interested in them,''
Paul said, ``but some are designed just as a demagogue or to
support a position.''
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters declares itself non-partisan,
but of the six candidates recently targeted by the pro-environment
group for defeat in the fall elections, five are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers' reactions to the report cards vary. Doggett, who has
received consistently good grades from the Concord Coalition, likes
to tout his rating as a ``deficit hawk'' in news releases.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, ``there's none that I pay attention to
whatsoever,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``I
don't represent the people who do those ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``I have felt injured on occasion'' by ratings, Armey
admitted. ``This real liberal group gave me a 5 percent vote once,
and I was discomforted.''
</P>
<P>
   Others also claim that their legislative actions are based on
principle, not pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casting votes in Congress may have the appearance of running
across a bomb-cratered battlefield of special interests and other
influences, including various lobby groups' report cards,'' said
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ``But for members who have a firm grasp
of their constituents' will, it is a confident stride down Main
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more aggressive interest groups _ particularly those
connected with PACs _ use report cards as lobbying tools by telling
lawmakers in advance that they will be including certain votes in
their calculations. Sometimes, this tactic works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more obscure the issue, the more impact they might have,''
Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   Advance notice made a difference this spring when a music
licensing bill came before the House, Doggett said. The National
Federation of Independent Business sent out a notice that it was
supporting a ``yes'' vote and would count the vote on its report
card.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much information out about this bill, and some
(House) members came onto the floor and knew a national
organization would be counting it,'' said Doggett. Knowing that the
NFIB and its 600,000 members were backing this relatively unknown
bill helped some members to make up their minds, Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to know about it in advance,'' he said of votes
being rated.
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups aren't alone in using upcoming report cards to
pressure lawmakers into voting a certain way. Lawmakers sometimes
pressure the interest groups to rate specific votes, counting on
the added weight to push their colleagues one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that sometimes as a matter of strategy,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups won't honor lawmakers' requests or inform lawmakers
in advance of the votes being watched. Katina said the American
Conservative Union believes that surprise plays an important part
in determining the true ideological attitudes of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an important component of our ratings,'' said Katina.
``We do not use our ratings as a lobbying tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concord Coalition's communications director, Craig Cheslog,
said that the group sends out letters to alert lawmakers to all
legislation they see as important. However, they don't reveal
whether a particular vote will be a key vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge them to vote our way,'' Cheslog said, ``whether the
vote counts in the ratings or not.''

GATTON FINALLY HITS RIGHT CHORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
DANNY GATTON/``Untouchable''
<TEXT>
<P>
   This album was begun 10 years ago but interrupted when late
rockabilly-jazz guitar virtuoso Danny Gatton signed with a major
for two discs. Few recordings have done this guy justice, but
``Untouchable'' (NRG) comes closest to capturing the delicate chord
voicings and shimmering, lightning-quick runs that made Gatton a
Maryland roadhouse legend long before he took his own life several
years ago. Among the best moments are Gatton's tribute to jazz
guitarist Lenny Breau, ``One for Lenny''; a solid nod to Motown
with ``Ain't That Peculiar'' (featuring late Washington, D.C.-area
jazz diva Eva Cassidy on backups); and the tongue-in-cheek
``Untouchables'' theme. The only thing missing here is a little
more gutbucket blues. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LINDA RONSTADT/``We Ran''
</P>
<P>
   We can imagine the closed-door meeting high above Hollywood.
``Linda, sweetie, we loved the Mexican stuff, really we did. And
the Broadway and big-band tunes. The kids' lullabies _ genius,
sheer genius. But, please, doll, give us some pop music. Give us
some product we can move.'' The unspoken warning _ one more
ludicrous attempt to make ``art'' and you're gonna be selling your
homemade CDs out of the trunk of the station wagon _ obviously
worked. So, for her 31st album, Ronstadt returns to the terrain
that established her as a top rock interpreter. ``We Ran''
(Elektra), coming from somewhere near the town of Last Chance, is a
goodie. Whether covering Bob Dylan (``Just Like Tom Thumb's
Blues''), John Hiatt (``When We Ran''), Bruce Springsteen (``If I
Should Fall Behind'') or Irma Thomas (``Ruler of My Heart''),
Ronstadt, backed by some top local players, is in tip-top shape. 3
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WES MONTGOMERY/``Ultimate''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a fun proposition: George Benson chooses his favorite Wes
tunes. Or favorite Wes tunes on Verve, that is. ``Ultimate'' turns
out to be a joy, unless, of course, you already have these 14
tracks _ including such classics as ``Twisted Blues,'' ``Caravan,''
``Tequila,'' ``West Coast Blues,'' ``Impressions'' and ``Four on
Six'' _ on other reissues. In any case, the liner notes are
revealing. Benson points out something I didn't know _ that the
late Montgomery had a big old ``corn'' on his thumb that helped
give his guitar playing its distinctive hard-soft sound. ``That's
why no one will ever match Wes,'' Benson insists, forgetting that
Montgomery didn't own the patent on finger warts. Because, in
actual fact, it could only have been a wart since corns generally
appear on feet. Unless Wes' thumb was really a big toe. In which
case, yes indeedy, no one will ever match Wes thumb for thumb. 4
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PURE SUGAR/``Pure Sugar''
</P>
<P>
   If you're turned onto L.A.'s coolest station _ Groove 103.1 _
you've heard local dance-pop outfit Pure Sugar's hits, ``Hands to
Heaven'' and the appropriately titled ``Delicious.'' Although
``Pure Sugar'' (Geffen), starring the heartfelt vocals of onetime
club kid Jennifer Starr, offers more than disco and synth-r&AMP;b
sounds, there's enough of it to keep any raver happy. No matter
what your tastes, you'll have to admit ``Delicious,'' based on a
chunk of A Taste of Honey's 1978 smash ``Boogie Oogie Oogie,'' is
pure exhilaration. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHUCHO VALDES/``Bele Bele en la Habana''
</P>
<P>
   Latin-jazz trailblazer Valdes here inserts his Afro-Cuban piano
style into a selection of straight-ahead jazz material. Leading an
imaginative and energetic trio of young Havana-based players,
composer-pianist Valdes offers sizzling dance tracks and lush
ballads, touching on a variety of indigenous Cuban rhythms in the
process. ``Bele Bele en la Habana'' (Blue Note) lives up to its
translation _ ``Something's Happening in Havana.'' 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GRACE JONES/``Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions''
</P>
<P>
   At last comes a twin-CD set focusing on some of the best early
'80s dance music of all. That would be the Jones' stylish sessions
with the Compass Point All-Stars led by the dynamic reggae rhythm
section of drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare,
including keyboardist Wally Badarou and guitarists Barry Reynolds
and Mickey ``Mao'' Chung. ``Private Life: The Compass Point
Sessions'' (Island) explores three albums: ``Warm Leatherette,''
``Nightclubbing'' and ``Living My Life,'' offering hits from each,
two previously unreleased tunes, four previously unheard versions
of hits and 16 numbers appearing on CD for the first time. The
stuff still holds up. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHIRLEY BROWN/``The Soul of a Woman''
</P>
<P>
   A mess of r&AMP;b and gospel tunes get the going over from Southern
soul diva Brown, owner of some of the biggest pipes since Ann
Peebles or Dorothy Love Coates. ``The Soul of a Woman'' (Malaco),
recorded in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee with the real guys
(guitarist Jimmy Johnson, bassist David Hood, drummer Roger Hawkins
and the Muscle Shoals Horns), is just that _ a glimpse inside the
heart and soul of a genuine dear. Best tracks here include the sly
Millie Jackson-esque ``I Caught You With Your Pants Down'' and the
rousing gospel of ``He Looked Beyond My Faults.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DAVE ALVIN/``Blackjack David''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin's band usually includes some of the finest roots musicians
on the scene. His latest album, ``Blackjack David'' (HighTone),
produced by country guitar mainstay Greg Leisz and named after the
traditional folk tune that opens the disc, is also Alvin's first
collection of mostly new material in some time. It's a doozy,
putting forward many of this brilliant songwriter's most evocative
songs _ ``Abilene,'' ``New Highway,'' ``The Way You Say Goodbye''
and ``From a Kitchen Table,'' among them. If you're a fan of
first-rate writing or just want to check up on some top-notch roots
music, this one's for you. 4 Stars.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy added jobs at a more subdued
pace in June, and the unemployment rate rose to a three-month high.
Labor costs remained in check. Payrolls expanded by 205,000 jobs
last month, near expectations, smaller than May's increase, which
was revised to 309,000 jobs from the 296,000 reported initially.
The unemployment rate increased to 4.5 percent in June from 4.3
percent in May. A separate report shows that the number of workers
filing for state unemployment benefits rose last week as the strike
against General Motors put thousands out of work. By Sylvia Nasar.

mounting investor optimism that the country's ailing economy could
be turning the corner; stocks rose again in Tokyo, with the

   CHICKEN-SOUP-PUBLISHER (Deerfield Beach, Fla.) _ There is little
about Health Communications, a publishing house, that is
conventional except that it ladles up bestsellers. It had three
entrants on the New York Times paperback bestseller lists last
weekend, including the 17th book in its warm and goose-bumpy series
of inspirational tales, ``Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.'' The
company rarely pays author advances, loathes advertising, binds its

WAR ON DRUGS IMPOVERSISHES LEBANON FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAALBEK, Lebanon _ During Lebanon's long civil war, the Bekaa
Valley flourished as one of the world's most fertile regions for
growing cannabis for hashish and poppies for heroin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, as it struggled to emerge from more than a decade of
self-destruction and lawlessness, Lebanon successfully controlled
its illicit drug crops, with the support of the United States. But
in the process it left tens of thousands of farmers indigent. In
return, the United States and the United Nations promised to help
these farmers grow other crops, like cherries, apricots, and
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers say that adequate international aid never
materialized. Now, amid broken promises and economic desperation,
they are threatening to plant those profitable and illegal crops. A
few farmers have already begun planting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all used to grow hashish and heroin. That is not a secret.
We just want a decent life. These are good people who believe in
God and raise good families,'' said Mohammad Fawaz, a member of the
Central Bekaa Agricultural Cooperative and a candidate in the first
local elections here in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never comfortable growing illegal crops. We just did
it to survive,'' Fawaz said. ``During the war, it was either that
or pick up a gun. It was chaos here then. We don't want to return
to those days ever again. But desperation forces people to do
desperate things. And I am afraid these farmers are desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Bekaa farmers has surfaced in the cynical
aftermath of aggressive US rhetoric about the ``war on drugs.''
Critics attacked these kinds of US and UN eradication strategies at
the recent UN drug summit as futile efforts that are destructive
for local economies. Critics say the drug eradication efforts lack
long-range alternative development programs for poor farming
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Bekaa's highly profitable fields of pink flowering opium
poppies and green stalks of cannabis that once flourished along the
roadsides were all but destroyed in the past six years as US-funded
Lebanese troops burned fields and sprayed contaminants on crops
from US helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was by all accounts successful, and last year the
Clinton administration removed Lebanon from its list of major
drug-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort also triggered an agrarian revolt, led by a
religious leader named Sheik Sobhi Toufeili, who used to be part of
the Hezbollah guerrilla movement. The Shiite cleric's so-called
Hunger Revolution has tapped into a groundswell of populist
resentment among the farmers who feel betrayed by the West and
ignored by the wealthy elite of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Daily Star, Lebanon's respected English-language daily,
reluctantly acknowledged in a February editorial the legitimacy of
Toufeili's protest movement. ``His motives were geared toward his
own political gain, but his outcry for the government to invest in
the social and economic well-being of the region is justified,''
the paper wrote. ``The international community owes Lebanon support
in its continued effort to prevent the re-emergence of the drug
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials in Lebanon concede that international aid
distributed largely through UN development programs has failed to
meet its promises. The United Nations has spent $13 million in
recent years to help farmers. But its own studies estimate the
costs run four times that simply to create adequate irrigation in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   US officials point out that USAID has begun its own five- year
plan targeting the farmers with millions of dollars. The highlight
of their effort, said James Stephenson, a USAID representative in
Lebanon, was a shipment this winter of 3,000 Holstein cows flown
into the Bekaa from New England, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy cows were dismissed by farmers and other critics as a
token effort that does not approach the hundreds of millions of
dollars that other countries such as Turkey have received for their
antidrug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the garden of his modest home, Bassam, 29, explained the
basic economics behind his decision to grow cannabis once again.
</P>
<P>
   If he cultivates it on a 500-square-yard field, he will produce
approximately four kilos of hashish, worth roughly $8,000, at
minimal labor cost. If he grows potatoes or government-subsidized
tobacco on the same field, he will produce a crop worth about $350
and have to pay laborers at least $150 to tend and harvest the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our families are starving. We believed the US when it said it
would help us. We destroyed the old crops, but now we have nothing.
Where is America now that I owe the local bakery $700 for bread?''
asked Bassam, who spoke on condition that his last name not be
used. ``We stopped the drugs here, and now America turns its back
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassam said that about 10 percent of Bekaa farmers have returned
to illegal crops on small, remote patches of land. But he warned
that most farmers are tempted to do the same if there is no
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Fawaz lives in a comfortable home. His wife and
daughters offered a silver platter of fresh fruit, and tea served
in china cups. He said he is among the wealthier farmers because he
saved his money and bought large tracts of land on which he grows
primarily tobacco, potatoes and apricots.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most farmers, it is a 180-degree turn for the worse now,''
he said. ``The US government promised to deliver aid through the
UN. But we have not seen a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Fawaz said the money that has been channeled through the United
Nations, whose antidrug efforts has been dominated and funded by
the United States, has been absorbed into the organization's
administative costs. The farmers have been offered UN loans at
interest rates between 12 and 18 percent. UN-subsidized pesticides
and fertilizers are also expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Mountain, a UN Development Program coordinator, told
farmers during a recent tour of a poor village in the Bekaa, ``I
hear your complaints loud. I hear your frustrations, and I share
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A UN report found that 60 percent of the 54,000 farmers in the
region grew cannabis during the war and that the successful US-led
eradication efforts left virtually all of those farmers out of
work.
</P>
<P>
   The impoverished region already faced economic calamity. The
Bekaa has limited access to potable water, inadequate social and
health services, and the highest illiteracy rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Water is the key to the transition away from drug crops, which
require minimal irrigation. There are large underground aquifers
from nearby mountains and rivers, but those sources are very
difficult to reach. And the infrastructure necessary to use them
for irrigation is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain said that after the United Nations took care of basic
needs for the population, there was only $13 million left to create
an irrigation system that requires an investment of more than $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Coffin, a researcher for the New York-based nonprofit
Lindsmith Center, says there is a pattern in other poor countries,
of the United States and the United Nations ``shaking a carrot in
front of farmers and beating with a stick at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffin added, ``It is part of the misguided global drug war by
the US and the UN, which ignores the economics of the drug trade
and the fact there will always be poor farmers who will grow as
long as there is demand for drugs.''

TEACHER STANDARDS PUT CELLUCCI CAMPAIGN TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Board of Education finished voting Wednesday,
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci finally had the tougher
teacher-testing policy he wanted, but the victory came at a heavy
political price.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Cellucci's zig-zagging on the pivotal issue has not
only cast doubt on his leadership abilities, but has also helped
undercut his standing as a strong favorite in the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Cellucci shrugged off criticism that has
dogged him since he first acquiesced in the board's decision to
water down teacher-certification standards, then flip-flopped to
demand tougher requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not concerned about political consequences,'' he said.
``I am concerned with doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci's fumbling of the testing issue, coming after a
series of missteps on lesser matters, has helped reshape a
governor's race in which he was once a heavy favorite. Adding to
that perception is a new University of Massachusetts poll showing
that two of Cellucci's Democratic opponents have drawn almost even
with him in the public's estimation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's controversy capped a month in which Cellucci has
repeatedly been caught off-guard or has seemed unwilling to address
some fundamental state policy issues. The going has gotten so rocky
that long-time friends increasingly doubt the abilities of his
inner circle of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the administration, some of the best and the brightest
officials bridle under an intellectual lockdown that has left the
year barren of important policy initiatives. Others fret that the
lack of action has caused much of Cellucci's cabinet to fade almost
to anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one source says doubts have grown so pronounced that
even Argeo R. Cellucci, the acting governor's father, has privately
complained that his son's handlers ``are not letting Paul be
Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci himself, other sources say, may be growing frustrated
and is ready to rely more on his own instincts than the advice of
chief of staff Virginia Buckingham and campaign manager Rob Gray,
who are pushing him to run a campaign of low-key conflict
avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say that the current strategy has made Cellucci,
despite the political knowledge that comes of years on Beacon Hill,
seem less a take-charge chief executive than a cautious caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's a little angry,'' said one GOP source. ``It's clear he
is going to use own instincts more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Howell, a Cellucci's political consultant, scoffed at the
idea that Buckingham and Gray are botching the acting governor's
re-election effort. Howell particularly tried to craft the flap
over the teacher-testing standards as a ``big win'' for the acting
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other candidates have been reduced to holding press
conferences and criticizing the governor, but Paul Cellucci dug in,
got the voters, and turned the board around,'' Howell said. ``While
everyone was on the sidelines booing, he got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   But other more neutral political analysts say Cellucci has
squandered his months as acting governor instead of developing a
strong image with voters and that the teacher testing controversy
only compounded his problems.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Domke, a Republican consultant, said Cellucci's penchant
for avoiding risks has made him vulnerable because he has not
connected with the public in a way that has earned him a deeply
rooted respect or popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he is viewed as just another politician who has to dodge
the incoming barbs,'' Domke said. ``In politics, the biggest risk
is not taking risks. Part of Bill Weld's popularity is he took
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Cellucci's handling of the whole teacher testing
fiasco suggests a candidate and an administration not quite ready
for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, establishing his election-year themes in his State
of the State speech, Cellucci firmly declared that he would stand
his ground against any attempt to water down educational standards.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he knew student failure rates would create pressure to
lower standards, Cellucci vowed: ``But I will stand firm. I will
not lower the standards. I will not let mediocrity be the standards
for our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Board of Education did just that on teacher
standards by voting to lower the passing grade prospective teachers
must achieve to be certified, Cellucci seemed to have forgotten his
January vow.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wouldn't have voted that way himself, Cellucci said,
he couldn't reverse the vote. ``The decision has been made,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after three days reflection that Cellucci decided he
would try to change the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the acting governor's repeated promises to insist on
high educational standards, several board members said Wednesday he
made no attempt to lobby them before the board's vote to lower the
passing grade for prospective teachers. Nor, as he himself conceded
Wednesday, did the Acting Governor talk to Frank Haydu, the interim
commissioner of education.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the controversy broke, there was reason to doubt the
Rose Garden strategy of avoiding contentious issues and eschewing
big ideas in favor of low-key tours parcelling out grants on
regional tours.
</P>
<P>
   The same period has seen him duck questions about University of
Massachusetts President William Bulger, contradict himself on the
proposed tobacco settlement, and make a blatantly political attempt
to avoid taking a position on a ballot question to eliminate
turnpike tolls.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the controversy over teacher testing, which has
dominated headlines and newscasts for a week, that really
crystallized those doubts. The only good news, one Cellucci adviser
said, was that the episode had jolted a campaign and an
administration grown cautious and complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wakeup call,'' this person said. ``Hey, we're
in a race here. We need to be more diligent and not get behind the
curve.''

 DUBLIN: ... than hurt.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But ``it didn't faze me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles when asked if she is hard to work for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I think I'm fairly demanding, probably. You have
to feel that when you're appointed to a job you have to do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses for a moment, then adds, ``The reprimand part was
unfortunate.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A natural politician
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are jealous of her, full stop,'' said Mary O'Rourke, the
Irish Cabinet minister for trade. ``Jean came here without a
reputation in politics, but she practiced the art of politics
better than her male predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Adams is partial to her. The former IRA leader turned
politician has brought the Irish republican movement into the
political mainstream. He credits Kennedy Smith with assisting in
that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes in dialogue, in creating the conditions that lead
to dialogue,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith says her ``open house'' policy was simply
following White House policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said the United States will help those who
take risks for peace, and I agree wholeheartedly with that
philosophy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She took risks herself. She backed the Adams visa long before
Clinton did. Attorney General Janet Reno and then Secretary of
State Warren Christopher were toeing the British line, that Adams
was an unreconstructed terrorist, that he needed to denounce
terrorism and distance himself from the IRA. Kennedy Smith accepted
that for Adams to do so would be political, if not literal,
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith's friends, among them the author Tim Pat Coogan
and the New York publisher Niall O'Dowd, who were both privy to
Sinn Fein strategy, told her that the IRA was considering a
cease-fire. But the IRA did not trust the British government, and
wanted the American government to broker the peace process. John
Hume, the leader of moderate nationalism in Northern Ireland, and
Albert Reynolds, then the Irish prime minister, told her they
thought letting Adams into the United States could dramatically
change the political climate and set in motion events that could
lead to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to prove that politics worked, worked better than
violence and produced better results,'' said Reynolds. ``Getting a
visa for Gerry Adams against all the opposition from London would
show the republican leadership and nationalists that politics and
the democratic system does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Kennedy said his sister convinced him to back the visa for
Adams, and to lobby Clinton for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to my big sister,'' Kennedy explained, only
half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton let Adams in, the resulting howls from the British
Establishment convinced the IRA that it was a bigger deal than it
really was.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith went even further in August 1994, when the IRA's
cease-fire was being held up because Sinn Fein wanted Joe Cahill,
the 78-year-old former IRA chief of staff, to brief American
supporters. Cahill had been convicted of killing a policeman in
1942, and the White House would have to intervene to let him into
the United States. Compounding the problem was the timing. Both
Washington and Dublin are virtually shut down during the last week
of August.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith was on vacation in France when she learned about
the holdup. She tracked down Nancy Soderberg, then the National
Security Council director, who was on vacation in Madrid. A few
days later, she found Soderberg again, this time in Los Angeles,
and repeated her appeal. Sensing that Soderberg was unconvinced,
Kennedy Smith called Reynolds on a boat in the Mediterranean and
asked him to call Soderberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 25 percent Irish. Tell her to use it,'' Kennedy Smith
told him.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith didn't leave anything to chance. She disturbed one
more vacation, calling President Clinton on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill got in and the cease-fire was declared 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when Soderberg gets an unexpected phone call in a
strange place, she half-thinks it's Jean Kennedy Smith. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bonds of bereavement
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While such diplomatic persistence impressed many, it did little
to change the perception among Protestants in Northern Ireland that
the Kennedys in general, and Jean Kennedy Smith in particular, are
blatantly pro-nationalist. Still, the leaders of loyalist groups,
which in the past killed Catholics in an attempt to weaken support
for the IRA, are among those who regularly attended Kennedy Smith's
soirees.
</P>
<P>
   Among her fans is Billy Hutchinson, a leader of the Progressive
Unionist Party, the political wing of the Ulster Volunteer Force,
for which he served 15 years in prison for killing two Catholics.
Hutchinson said his party sees her as a nationalist, but admires
her for treating them with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the IRA and the main loyalist paramilitary groups
called their cease-fires in 1994, it has been the representatives
of the extremists who have been most willing to compromise. It is
their people, after all, who do the bulk of the killing, dying, and
prison time. In Kennedy Smith, they found someone who understood
both the weight of suffering and the promise of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over the Dublin Mountains in the distance, Jean
Kennedy Smith acknowledges that the assassinations of her brothers
have had a profound effect on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I went to Belfast for a reception. We
saw in the news that a woman's husband had been shot. I said I
wanted to stop by and see her. So we did. We just took a long walk,
the woman and I, and she told me the story of how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the men who killed her husband ran out of the house, her
two children ran out after them, screaming, `You bastards!' She was
so afraid that they'd shoot her kids, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extemely brave, and I was very moved. She opened up to
me, because I think she saw me as someone who's been through it. I
think she felt that we had some bond there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to see how people came to their positions.
It's understandable, there was so much violence. I experienced that
in my own family. I think they appreciated the fact that I could
understand it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
An Irish heritage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The extended family is living here vicariously. Even those long
dead are everywhere, in photographs and paintings. Rose's photo is
on a radiator. Bobby and Jack are framed together on a side table.
Joseph Kennedy Sr. and three of his four sons, Jack, Bobby, and
Ted, are engraved into a decanter that rests, empty, on another
table.
</P>
<P>
   There is an oil portrait of Joe Sr. in the main foyer. A
portrait of Jack, looking pensive, stares across at his father, his
mother's portrait just beneath him. There is a Jamie Wyeth of the
ambassador hanging in one of the reception rooms. In the hush of an
afternoon, all of these Kennedy eyes are unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are Irish, the Kennedys are obsessed with history
and anniversaries. Kennedy Smith took up her Dublin post 30 years
to the day that she arrived in Ireland with her brother, Jack. She
carried with her a photograph of her standing with President
Clinton after he nominated her. Ted wrote on the back: ``For Jean,
who is going back in the springtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she returns to New York, she will end her official duties
Sunday as she began them, by going back to New Ross, in Wexford,
149 years after her great-grandfather Patrick Kennedy boarded a
ship there to escape the potato famine and begin a new life in
Boston. She will travel just a bit outside New Ross, to a place
called Dunganston, to the Kennedy homestead. She goes there, on
occasion, to smell the air, to wonder what would have happened if
her great-grandfather had not got on that boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-grandfather's youngest brother never left,'' she
says. ``And his great-grandson, Pat Kennedy, is a farmer in
Wexford. I visit him and we talk. We always have a chuckle about
what would have happened if his great-grandfather had gone over,
and how life would have been so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested Jean Kennedy Smith was driven by a desire to
complete some unfinished family business. She isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of the tide,'' she says, glancing at a photo of her
brother, the dead president. ``I really didn't think of it as a
Kennedy thing. I thought of it as a moment. A moment in history.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sometime early on the morning of April 15, 1912, a white
porcelain teacup trimmed with 22-carat gold followed the Titanic to
the ocean floor. It settled, right-side up, on a crushed,
building-sized boiler that had been stoked by laborers, joining for
eternity symbols of the rich and the working class in a union too
deep for tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed when the cup was photographed by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, which located the wreck in 1985 and,
honoring its sanctity, took away only pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 2 1/2-mile-deep wreck has been visited 132
times, 96 of them under the auspices of George Tulloch, a
Connecticut entrepreneur whose exhibit, ``Titanic _ The Artifact
Exhibition,'' opened July 1 in a tent opposite the World Trade
Center in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Tulloch and associates have corralled about 5,000 items from the
wreck. Critics, including a Titanic historian, call Tulloch a grave
robber who has cheapened the Titanic by disturbing it for profit.
Admirers call him a hero who has guaranteed the artifacts will be
around for centuries, silently screaming of the thoughtlessness
that led to humankind's most spectacular maritime folly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, today, someone were to break off a piece of Plymouth Rock,
would the Museum of Fine Arts rush to display it?'' asked Don
Lynch, a Titanic historian and author who is vice president of the
Springfield-based Titanic Historical Society. ``What a shame that
Eastern Massachusetts, which has figured so prominently in our
nation's history, has so little regard for it by displaying these
artifacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Titanic historian takes the opposing camp's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been unethical not to salvage these artifacts,
and to have allowed the acidic sands to continue destroying them,''
said Charles Haas, a New Jersey teacher who has written three books
about the Titanic. ``Wait too long, and the pieces will be
destroyed. Tell me: Just when does history begin? When is it proper
to collect the evidence of a major human event?''
</P>
<P>
   The teacup, dramatically photographed by Dr. Robert D. Ballard
in ``The Discovery of the Titanic,'' is not in the exhibit. In
fact, its whereabouts today are in dispute. Critics suspect it was
knocked from its deep sea perch by all the robots plying the wreck
for the past nine years. To them, its disappearance represents
everything that is wrong with excavating a ship for profit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Paul Louden Brown, a Titanic Historical Society officer who
lives in Kent, England, has accused Tulloch of ``looting it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For 80 years, it nestled undisturbed, testament to an event
that caught ordinary people in an extraordinary moment of time,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Tulloch adamantly denies touching the cup, saying it remains
where it has always been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I care about? Making this exhibit so tasteful,
so devastatingly emotional that no one ever, ever ignores the kind
of warnings Captain (Edward J.) Smith ignored when he speeded into
that iceberg field,'' said Tulloch, who is 53.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: It is not smooth sailing through the ethical
reefs of a disaster that killed more than 1,500 people at a site
where the US Coast Guard continues to drop a commemorative wreath
annually. Is ``Titanic _ The Artifact Exhibition,'' a legend to
life or an insult to the dead? When the exhibit opened in London in
1994, it was the first time artifacts from the sunken ship had ever
been displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriateness of the display is an issue for James
Delgado, a maritime archeologist who has written extensively on the
pitfalls of salvaging shipwrecks for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most important is that the audience ask the question,'' said
Delgado, executive director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum.
``This exhibit may end up teaching you most about yourself.'' He
praised the careful conservation and archeological standards
maintained by Tulloch's crews.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston show (9 a.m.-6 p.m. Sun.-Thurs, 9 a.m.-8 p.m.
Fri.-Sat.) will be the fifth for an exhibit that has traveled
through London, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, Fla., and Memphis. The
show has been popular enough to force an extension of exhibition
hours and dates in those cities, curators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston show features 500 artifacts, including sheet music,
the ship's telegraph (the device that linked the bridge to the
engine room), and personal effects such as a man's suit and china,
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   A string of victories in Admiralty Court has granted Tulloch's
RMS Titanic Inc. exclusive salvaging rights to the wreck. He
essentially has vowed not to sell artifacts, and envisions storing
the collection, to which he adds annually, in its own museum
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I die it will be together,'' Tulloch said of the
collection during a break in exhibition construction the other day.
</P>
<P>
   But as remnants of the Titanic literally surface _ Tulloch hopes
to bring the bow up this summer _ vestiges of the disaster's
aftermath, captured in photographs such as the teacup, disappear
below. And this, said Louden Brown, cheapens the Titanic story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ship is still within the memory of the five living
survivors,'' he said. ``Shall I go collect and display artifacts
from the TWA 800 disaster or the Challenger explosion? Would this
be right? Who would pay, other than the ghouls?''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``There's nothing historically relevant in the
Titanic exhibit. We see a smoking pipe. So what have we learned?
That Edwardians smoked?''
</P>
<P>
   To such criticism, Tulloch cites such memorials as the Holocaust
Museum in Washington, which charges admission to illustrate with
actual artifacts the horror and bravery of humans in distress. No
human remains have been confirmed in the Titanic wreckage;
salvagers surmise the dead drifted away from the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, the schoolteacher, said an artifact does not have to be
unique to be historically important. For example, he said he
recently viewed in the exhibit a pair of eyeglasses, nail clippers,
a paperback book with a turned-down page, and pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   ``By themselves, they didn't mean much. But consider that they
were in the possession of Abe Lincoln when he was shot,'' Haas
said. ``That's how artifacts teach us about an event, and about
ourselves.''

 WEST TISBURY, Mass.: ... development rights.

<P>
   Obtaining Spongberg, one of the country's most respected
horticulturalists, as its first director was a coup. He was asked
to recommend a director and surprised everyone by retiring from his
position as horticultural taxonomist at Harvard's Arnold Arboretum
to take the Vineyard job himself.
</P>
<P>
   The classic shingled caretaker's cottage near the road, once a
17th-century inn on the long trip from Vineyard Haven to Gay Head,
has been transformed into Spongberg's office with conference and
library space.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Visitors center
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the property, which includes 20 acres of
gardens and 40 wooded acres, a new entrance with parking for 50
cars has been added, leading to a striking new visitors center
designed by Thompson &AMP; Rose Architects of Cambridge. With the help
of structural engineer Wayne King of Ipswich, it was built on a
shallow foundation using a structural design new to this country.
``They didn't want to hurt the roots of stewartia trees growing
nearby so they actually used a technique from Scandinavia where
frost is a problem,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase building was affordable, he said, because ``this is
their next national prize winner. We're doing a lot more than
people thought we could at half the cost originally estimated by
one Martha's Vineyard builder.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors center features a heavy timber construction system
with thick Douglas fir beams tapered like tree trunks. Many large
windows create an airy interior (it won't have to be heated in the
winter). You feel the outdoors when you're indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a designated picnic area and another handsome building
containing the Vineyard's most elegant public restrooms. ``We're
very excited about it. They're the only public bathrooms on that
side of the island. Our client wanted to make beautiful bathrooms
as a gift to the people who come to the Vineyard,'' said Maryann
Thompson, who with her partner, Charles Rose, earned a Young
Architects Citation for design this year from the American
Institute of Architects for integrating a Florida building with its
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The roofs of both buildings have a shedlike single pitch that
not only kept costs down, but directs rainwater to gutters that
extend 2 feet beyond the edge of each building to make waterfalls.
Each drains into a catch basin, which creates a small pool for a
garden of water-loving plants designed by Van Valkenburgh
Associates of Cambridge. Benches under the overhanging roofs allow
visitors to sit outside and enjoy the waterfalls when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   A large barn long used by barn owls is also being restored to
provide classroom and exhibition space. Vineyarder Bruce Weatherbee
is doing the construction.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Educational role
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith envisions an arboretum dedicated to science and education
that hosts symposiums and uses plants to introduce scientific
methodology to local elementary school students. (No weddings, he
said.)
</P>
<P>
   Docents will provide tours throughout the season. Smith also
commissioned a video of Hill leading a personal tour through the
collection, which she will now be able to do in perpetuity as she
takes her place in island lore as one of the Vineyard's defining
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the garden with Hill, whether in person or via video, is
a memorable experience. She'll point out each of the new azaleas
she named for her family members, immortalizing them, too, in a
way. Her husband, the late Julian Hill, a scientist who worked on
the research team that developed nylon for Du Pont, gave her a hard
time about this when she tried to name an azalea after him. ``He
said he didn't like azaleas. He said he wanted a white flower, a
big white flower. So I named my biggest white flower after him,''
she said, peering into a 15-inch white chalice on a large tree she
named Magnolia macrophylla cultivar Julian Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Any tour in Hill's trademark yellow golf cart includes a spin
down the 240-foot allee of Kousa dogwoods, through the European
hornbeam ``tunnel of love,'' and into the 385-foot-long fenced
enclosure her family nicknamed The Playpen because of all the time
she spent there. It contains many of her choicest azaleas,
including the North Tisbury series of flat ground-cover evergreen
azaleas, one of which is the aptly named Pink Pancake, grown from
seeds sent by a horticulturalist she met in Japan. ``I saw that
they had low azaleas growing around the temples, which we'd never
seen in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Change and continuity
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hill thrives on her garden's mix of change and continuity. The
passing seasons and her detailed computer records all provide a
framework for observing discoveries which, if you're growing trees
from seed, come slowly, but are no less thrilling for that.
</P>
<P>
   With lifetime rights to the converted barn that is her
summerhouse, she is planning for the future, and enjoying the
surprises that each day in her garden brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's my mother's pecan tree,'' she said, pointing to a
large specimen with long, peculiar catkins. ``She planted it in
1936 and this is the first time it's ever blossomed.''
</P>

Day to Columbus Day, and from dawn to dusk the rest of the year.

DANGER A SKIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skip Away ducked the famous one-two punch thrown by opposing
trainer Richard Mandella, the same punch that knocked out Cigar's
16-race winning streak, and went on to capture the $1 million
Hollywood Gold Cup last Sunday in stellar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Breeders' Cup, Mandella had saddled
the winner of the previous six $1 million races in California. He
is noted for sending out entries from his powerful stable of
handicap runners, many of them talented horses bred in South
America. In 1996, Mandella stopped Cigar's record run, which had
tied that of Citation as the best in North America during the
modern era, in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar by sending out
speedball Siphon to set a sizzling pace and closer Dare and Go to
come along and pick up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella tried the same thing Sunday, as Gentlemen (from
Argentina) stalked Skip Away's every step before tiring at the
eighth pole, even as closer Puerto Madero (from Chile) made a
fierce charge up the rail. Unlike Cigar, however, Skip Away (off at
2-5, $2.80 to win) had more than enough left to hold off Puerto
Madero and prevail by a length and three-quarters in the time of
2:00 for the mile and one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the seventh straight for Skip Away, five of
which have come this year. The $600,000 winner's purse raised the
big gray's career earnings to $8,906,360 in his hot pursuit of
Cigar's North American record of $9,999,815. Named champion
3-year-old in 1996 and handicap champion last year, Skip Away has a
career mark of 34-16-10-5, not bad for a $30,000 purchase as a
2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Skip Away's favor that he was ridden by Jerry Bailey,
who also rode Cigar. Bailey was the victim in the ending of the
Cigar streak. He went after Siphon far too early and far too fast,
and Cigar had nothing left when Dare and Go, who was less than a
standout, offered his surprisingly strong rally. This time, Bailey
sat chilly and let Gentlemen and Gary Stevens come right to the
pacesetting Skip Away entering the far turn. They raced stride for
stride into the stretch and, because Bailey never unduly urged Skip
Away, he finished up well despite the menacing move by Puerto
Madero and Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that if they want to run with him they are in
trouble,'' said Bailey. ``He'll put them away. I knew the setup
from the start. Gentlemen was supposed to soften him up and Puerto
Madero was supposed to come and get him. But he's too much horse.
He's a great horse; there's no quit in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Hine, who trains Skip Away for his wife, Carolyn, may
start him next in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar Aug.
15, where he could possibly face last year's 3-year-old champion
Silver Charm, as well as the Mandella duo. However, Skip Away has
had bothersome feet since running away during a gallop at Belmont
Park prior to the Gold Cup, which puts the Pacific Classic in
question.

</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold, who won the Belmont Stakes and the Haskell
Invitational at Monmouth in 1997 before a persistent quarter crack
forced him to the sidelines after poor performances in the Pegasus
at Meadowlands and the Breeders' Cup, made a terrific 1998 debut
last Sunday, winning a 1-mile allowance race at Churchill Downs in
1:34, one tick off the track record.
</P>
<P>
   Off at 1-5 ($2.40 to win), the talented son of Deputy Minister
prevailed by nearly 3 lengths under a patently patient ride by  &UR; Pat
Day &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran very fast and he got a lot out of it,'' said trainer
 &UR; Pat Byrne &LR; , who took over the conditioning of Touch Gold from
 &UR; David Hofmans &LR;  when he became private trainer for owner  &UR; Frank
Stronach  &LR; in December. ``He cooled out really well and we're happy
with that. The Whitney (at Saratoga Aug. 8) will be his next likely
start. If he has an unbeaten campaign, he has a great shot at Horse
of the Year.''

<P>
   There is a chance that Rockingham Park will attract a top grass
filly, Tresoriere, to Sunday's $75,000 Breeders' Cup Handicap,
which is run at a mile and one-16th.
</P>
<P>
   Tresoriere is trained by  &UR; Christophe Clement &LR; , who saddled
Statesmanship to victory in the $200,000 New Hampshire Sweeps June
20. She has been co-highweighted at 119 pounds, along with
stablemate Heaven's Command, among the 28 nominees. Tresoriere, a
daughter of Lyuphard, can really run. She took both the Grade III
Gallorette Handicap at Pimlico and the Moseley Handicap at Suffolk
last month and is 3 for 4 with a second on the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Dead Kennedys, their images, their spirits, are
everywhere in this grand Georgian house that Jean Kennedy Smith has
called home for five years. They don't haunt the place as much as
inform it with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That purpose is served now, and so Jean Kennedy Smith, the
longest-serving American ambassador to Ireland, is going home.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, she stood on these very grounds, in the
massive expanse they call the Phoenix Park, the shy sister of the
most powerful man in the world. She was standing here when John F.
Kennedy promised to return in the springtime. She was standing next
to her brother Jack when he looked around and wistfully suggested
he would like to live here as ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   But because of Dallas there couldn't be Dublin. It was left to
his little sister to return in the spring of 1993, to live in this
house as ambassador, to see through the unfinished business of
Ireland, which has always been, to one degree or another, the
unfinished business of the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 70-year-old Jean Kennedy Smith will end one of the
most improbable, controversial, and ultimately successful
diplomatic careers in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sleepy outpost for sleepy men, the US Embassy in
Ballsbridge, an ugly, circular granite building that looks like a
block of cheese, became a nerve center for White House foreign
policy on her watch. Britain's role as America's staunchest ally
became less important to a White House occupied by the first
president in a half-century whose world view was not shaped by
World War II. Under Bill Clinton, Washington abandoned its
hands-off policy in Northern Ireland, injecting itself into the
conflict, and treating Dublin's view of the problem as equally
valid as London's. Clinton's precedent-breaking foreign policy was
enthusiastically encouraged by his ambassador in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomatic neophyte and a politician only by osmosis, Jean
Kennedy Smith eschewed protocol and went with her gut, pushing for
things that career diplomats considered too controversial _ among
them a visa for Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political wing, so he could enter the United
States in 1994 while the IRA was still killing people. Her disdain
for protocol rubbed many traditionalists the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan, the filmmaker who is among the eclectic mix at her
frequent dinner parties, gave her a cameo appearance in his film
``Michael Collins.'' Some at the State Department rolled their
eyes, thinking such a stunt was beneath the dignity of a sitting
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   When the Irish president, Mary McAleese, was getting flak for
breaking Catholic canon law by taking communion in an Anglican
church to promote ecumenism, Kennedy Smith showed some sisterly
solidarity by going out and doing the same. Again, the
traditionalists at Foggy Bottom shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith treated dissent from her staff as disloyalty. She
punished two career diplomats who questioned her judgment on the
Adams visa, a break with protocol for which she was reprimanded by
the State Department. Raymond Seitz, the former US ambassador to
Britain recently used his memoirs to slam her as shallow, naive,
and ``an ardent IRA apologist.''
</P>
<P>
   What may bother her critics most is that Jean Kennedy Smith got
results. She has left bruised egos and toes in her wake. But she
has played a prominent role in one of Bill Clinton's few foreign
policy success stories. She will leave her post having seen the
Northern Ireland political settlement overwhelmingly approved by
people throughout the island.
</P>
<P>
   As democratic politics gradually phase out terrorism in Ireland,
she has earned a mention in the history books for her own actions,
not those of her brothers. For someone who lived most of her life
in the shadow of powerful men, she has stepped out into the light
and, critics be damned, got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her library, the soft light of a soft Irish day
filtering across a face that looks at this angle so much like her
brother Bobby, dead these 30 years, Jean Kennedy Smith folds her
arms across her chest. She is sliding her pumps on and off, smiling
that Cheshire cat smile, when asked about a tenure marked by both
diplomatic controversy and diplomatic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I was very fortunate to be in the position to do
something positive, to make a contribution to change. It gave me
terrific satisfaction,'' she says. ``It wasn't any hardship for
me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
From the Kennedy mold
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hardship, however, is no stranger to Jean Kennedy. Despite
having grown up rich and privileged, there was always a hint of
melancholy about her. Being on the bottom rung of a big, important
family can be a lonely place. She and Teddy were the youngest of
nine kids, she four years older than he.
</P>
<P>
   She has not had an easy life. Three of her four brothers died
young and violently. Her husband, Stephen Smith, who died in 1990,
was part of the Kennedy machine and was often on the road. She
raised four children. One of her daughters, Kym, married a Dublin
bartender a few years ago in what was a Dublin society event. The
marriage didn't last. One of her sons, William, was acquitted of
rape in a highly publicized 1991 trial that was hardly a
vindication of Kennedy family get-togethers.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, there was a dogged determination about her,
an ability to ride out stormy waters. In that respect, she is often
compared to her sister-in-law, Ethel. It was Jean who fixed Bobby
up with Ethel, Jean who introduced Jackie to Jack, and Joan to Ted.
More than an aunt to most of her nieces and nephews, Jean is
literally the matchmaker who ensured their births.
</P>
<P>
   At her dinner parties, however, she breaks couples up, refusing
to seat them next to each other, or even at the same table.
Instead, she invites people of different backgrounds and political
persuasions then deliberately sits them next to or near each other.
She prides herself on prodding those with different viewpoints to
share and defend them.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent soiree, Liz Mansergh and Patricia Walsh sat across
from each other, debating the merits of the settlement in Northern
Ireland. Mansergh, whose husband, Martin, is the Irish government's
top Northern Ireland strategist, was understandably optimistic.
Walsh, a clinical psychologist, was more cynical, viewing the North
as a hopelessly violent and bigoted place.
</P>
<P>
   Both women, however, agreed on one thing: They love Jean Kennedy
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has an extraordinary talent for getting people of
different backgrounds together and getting them to talk,'' said
Mansergh.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is an unabashed fan because of the Very Special Arts
program for the mentally disabled, which Kennedy Smith founded. It
is now in 55 countries, including Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps telling that women are among Kennedy Smith's
staunchest admirers, and men among her most vituperative critics.
</P>
<P>
   Seitz, US ambassador to Britain from 1991 to 1994, says she got
the job because it ``had always been a plaything for American
presidents who wanted to score a point or two with the
Irish-American electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, ``Over Here,'' Seitz was less than diplomatic:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean Kennedy Smith, who distrusted her own staff and penalized
them for their dissent, became a promotion agent for Adams. Too
shallow to understand the past and too naive to anticipate the
future, she was an ardent IRA apologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Washington's ambassador to the Court of St. James
has been the most influential in the White House. But Seitz
increasingly found his counsel on Northern Ireland, a situation he
called ``an issue without a resolution,'' being ignored. Clinton,
who wanted to help break the cycle of violence and reap the
political benefits, was more receptive to his Dublin ambassador,
who told him that he could help change the political dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Seitz's influence was eclipsed by a woman who as an
11-year-old lived at 14 Prince's Gate, the palatial US ambassador's
house in London that Seitz so adores, by the daughter of one of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Seitz accused Kennedy Smith of ``clientitis,'' a serious offense
in diplomatic service marked by identifying more with the interests
of the country where you are stationed than the one for which you
work.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Seitz is an unabashed Anglophile who now lives in
England, many wrote his criticism off as sour grapes. Some friends
suggest Kennedy Smith was stung by his attack. But she professes
more bewilderment than hurt.

FOR GROUND COVERS, FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ajuga, pachysandra, and vinca are well-known ground covers, all
evergreen perennials. Cotoneaster, euonymus, and juniper also can
be ground covers, certain kinds being low-growing evergreen shrubs.
Day lilies, hostas, ornamental grasses, heaths and heathers _
myriad plants qualify as ground covers.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes one juniper a spreading welcome mat and another a
landscape specimen?
</P>
<P>
   Function and structure.
</P>
<P>
   Ground covers generally are planted to cover the ground in a
solid mass of foliage, reducing maintenance and creating attractive
textures and patterns. More specific functions include preventing
erosion on slopes, hiding the dying foliage of bulbs, providing
cover under ornamental trees and shrubs, and creating recreation
areas from rough playing fields to manicured putting greens.
</P>
<P>
   Plant structure, especially form, determines under what
circumstances a plant is appropriate as a ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   Metasequoias, or dawn redwoods, like things dampish, so mine had
to be moved from the front lawn to a depression. But since it
ultimately may reach 100 feet in height, it cannot be used as a
ground cover unless viewed from a substantial distance.
</P>
<P>
   Thyme, on the other hand, some kinds of which barely top an
inch, can be simply perfect in sunny spots on the ground or between
paving or among rocks, where I like it.
</P>
<P>
   If there's traffic, say from visiting children or resident
Newfoundland dogs, grass cannot be beat. There's a reason football
can't be played amid gaultheria or ivy. Nothing that can be trod
upon can withstand being trod upon the way grass does.
</P>
<P>
   Yet grass, while tough, requires a lot of maintenance.
Nutrition, disease, predation, soil compaction, a host of issues
affect grass. It must be mowed and watered, aerated if regularly
trampled, ``policed'' and reseeded if carnivorous quadrupeds
frequent it, and religiously sworn at.
</P>
<P>
   My strategy has been to carve garden beds from the lawns,
treating the remainder as grassy pathways (except for the back
lawn, which goes to the dogs, literally).
</P>
<P>
   I also have been removing lawn from around the trees and shrubs
so they do not have to compete with thirsty, hungry grass for
moisture and nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Under a clump of birches, I have cut a small, round bed and
planted it with Ajuga reptans ``Burgundy Glow,'' which has bronze
leaves with purple and pink tones. But while some people contend
with ajuga running amok in the lawn and elsewhere, I have struggled
to grow it in the gravelly soil under the birches. In the heat of
July, the thin leaves of this shallow-rooted plant would turn
papery, and the plants died. Finally, I have seen the light and
begun replacing the bad earth with soil loaded with composted
manure.
</P>
<P>
   Poor soil also is responsible for my travails with Phlox
subulata ``Emerald Pink,'' which has bright green, needled leaves
and is smothered in pink flowers in spring. It is in a bed on a
small slope with a mugho pine, goldthread chamaecyparis, and ``Blue
Chip'' juniper. With a few heucheras thrown in _ and they make nice
ground covers, too _ this first attempt at replacing lawn is
supposed to be tied together by the phlox. Again, soil amendments
are the answer.
</P>
<P>
   And that gets to the point that there are no easy answers.
Ground covers may spread and even be invasive in cases, but you
cannot get away with failing to prepare beds. Nor can you fail to
weed and maintain ground covers. They may require less maintenance
than lawns, but not at first.
</P>
<P>
   A related early effort was planting Vinca minor under a nearby
crab apple. It would fill a woodland transition zone with the dark
luster of its evergreen leaves plus the gorgeous light blue flowers
of ``Bowles Variety.'' Of course, that choice is the clumper among
the varieties of vinca vines, so it has not spread as fast as I
thought it would, and I have been busy weeding my vinca these past
years, though less so recently as it finally is filling in.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet woodruff, Galium odorata (formerly Asperula odorata),
which is under the crab apple on the other side of the house, also
has required weeding. This is great stuff. It has small white
flowers in spring and delicate whorled leaves that smell like
new-mown hay when disturbed and often even when left alone. Each
year I put in 12 small plugs, weeded (tall grass still comes up
amid it), and added manure. Last year I began tearing it up by the
roots (a satisfying way of keeping plants in bounds). I buried a
plastic edging strip around it, and it keeps on coming, threatening
the more elegant gingers and ferns growing at its edge.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the woodruff to break free so they can duke it out
for the garden championship are several mints I planted in an
edging scheme. The mints were in pots sunk into the earth, but they
escaped into the mulch. I have torn clumps from the ground, laid
them aside, then shoved them rudely into bad soil in another bed,
and they have thrived. Also part of that edging scheme are some
lamiums, with white-splotched leaves. These are lovely, and I keep
a careful eye on them to protect them from their thuggish
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   All of these, by the way, take shade, which is often one of the
requirements of a ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   My latest efforts include Baltic ivy along the north side of a
wall I am building along the road. I envision it climbing over the
wall and being kept in bounds by the head gardener's diligence. (No
gardener ever has enough to do.) I also have loosed pachysandra
under the apple tree, where nothing but weeds grows anyway, and
under the red maple, where it can compete with a bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   Bamboo, now there is a ground cover. Some get 30 feet high, and
it can just tear across a property. Be careful with this guy.
Still, I have a scheme. I'd like to screen my swimming pool from my
neighbor's new shed, built close to the property line, and I'd like
to have it happen quickly. Bamboo grows fast, and it goes well with
water. So maybe I can plant just a little screen of it. Oh, I'll
have to sink some kind of containment into the ground to keep it
from escaping. And I'll need to improve the gravel that lies under
the landscape plastic around the pool. And I suppose I'll have to
weed for a few years.

SHE SOWED A FEW SEEDS AND PLANTED A LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST TISBURY, Mass. _ A garden seldom outlives its creator. And
with a hot stock market spurring a vacation-home boom on Martha's
Vineyard, there was every chance that Polly Hill's renowned plant
collection on 60-acre Barnard's Inn Farm here would be cut up into
little pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But things worked out differently, and now the Polly Hill
Arboretum is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1958, Hill has been growing and selecting new plant
varieties at her summer residence at 809 State Road. She continues
to do so today. Because of her perseverance in growing trees that
weren't supposed to survive this far north, the garden contains 73
``New England Champion Trees'' designated the largest examples of
their species in the six-state region. Now her collection of 1,700
unusual specimen trees and shrubs will be preserved under the
directorship of Arnold Arboretum curator emeritus Stephen
Spongberg.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Philadelphia stockbroker, Hill began spending
summers at the old sheep farm as a teenager when her mother bought
it in 1927. She was 50 when she herself became its mistress and
took up gardening, planting the stone-wall grid of pastures with
seeds she acquired from around the world. From the start, she used
computers to keep detailed scientific records, a ``live file'' of
successes and a ``dead file'' of plant experiments that failed (of
equal interest to serious horticulturalists).
</P>
<P>
   Hill's goal was simple: to expand the list of plants growing on
Martha's Vineyard. The island seemed to her ``horticulturally
impoverished'' compared to her home state of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Her method was to grow everything from seed. Few people have the
patience to grow from seed a tree that may not bloom for 20 years.
Hill did, savoring the plant's struggling infancy as much as its
ornamental payoff at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Her result was plants such as evergreen Southern magnolias and
camellias that had never been seen growing outdoors on Martha's
Vineyard before.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Natural selection
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How did she do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that most trees and shrubs they buy are
vegetatively propagated,'' explained Spongberg. ``Like Dolly the
sheep, they're identical clones.''
</P>
<P>
   Working without a greenhouse, Hill would start seedlings
outdoors. Most would die. But because they varied genetically and
were not clones, some were more suited for a northern climate and
would survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather chose for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this way over a long span of time, Hill was able to introduce
more than 80 new plant varieties, including a family of 22 North
Tisbury azaleas. She also helped prove that the zonal
characteristics of plants can be dramatically extended if
individuals are grown from seed. ``There are so many factors
besides zones. What we have here on the Vineyard is perfect
drainage and no pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Her garden became a living catalog of what would grow on
Martha's Vineyard. But there's another reason islanders developed a
fond spot for Hill: In a community where privacy is increasingly
fiercely guarded, her garden had a veritable open-door policy to
lovers of horticulture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say, `Come in and behave.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the many who enjoyed the garden were artist Joan Smith
and her husband, Dr. David Smith, a low-profile summer resident
celebrated for his discovery of a vaccine that eliminated childhood
meningitis in the United States, where it killed or permanently
impaired 20,000 kids a year. A supporter of conservation causes,
Smith serves on the national board of the Environmental Defense
Fund and recently helped save Moshup Trail in Gay Head from
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the island's conservation groups,'' he recalled,
``and I said, `There's a lot of liquid money around that will soon
close off your options.' And I challenged them to come up with a
list of priority properties to preserve. And they started with
Polly Hill's because it's strategic as well as horticultural. It
connects to other conservation land.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't spend much time with Polly Hill without falling
in love with her.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Magic garden
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was excited by my records,'' explained the doyenne of the
affinity that grew between her and Smith, to the great relief of
those who had long worried about the magic garden's unsecured
future.
</P>
<P>
   Erect and aristocratic, cheerful and friendly, Hill is a
handsome woman who looks as timeless in her cardigans and sun hats
as the island's stone walls. Her only obvious bow to advanced age
is that she prefers driving to walking long distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know Polly Hill these last few years has been one
of the great joys of our lives,'' said Smith. ``The fact that she
was willing to start everything from seed at the age of 50 in this
era of instant gratification is a special treat. She's the
grandmother everyone wished they had. Bright. Intelligent. And
she's very well organized.''
</P>
<P>
   And so what started as a simple impetus to save open land
evolved into the much more sophisticated effort to preserve a
garden and create an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Other major contributors include the Hill family, horticultural
friends, and the state, which exchanged $300,000 for the land's
development rights.

TRUTH, LIES AND THE LOTTERY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   Lottery winnings can cause all sorts of vexing interpersonal
problems, as anyone who's been following the news lately must know.
So Dee Dee, our all-purpose advice columnist, is reaching out in
her usual caring way to readers with lottery-related questions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: I would like to join the swelling ranks of those
laying claim to that disputed $21 million lottery ticket. I didn't
actually telephone my bet into Watertown Provisions on Feb. 5, but
I distinctly remember telepathically projecting the winning numbers
to the store's lottery machine during my regular Thursday afternoon
out-of-body experience. So obviously the prize is mine. Although I
wouldn't mind sharing it. How should I go about claiming it? _
Optimistic
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee has always maintained that honesty is the best policy.
Just tell the truth. Dee Dee thinks that your story is as good as
any of the rest of the tales that have emerged thus far. She thinks
there's no way you can lose.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: Recently I was a guest on ``Jerry Springer,'' you
may have seen the show, ``Women Who Win Millions in the Lottery and
Throw it All Away on Some No Good Bum.'' I was one of the no good
bums, the third from the left. I am writing to protest the Springer
show's use of the phrase ``throw away.'' I earned every penny of
Darlene's winnings, and I have a note from my doctor to prove it.
Since the program aired my self-esteem has suffered and I find I
have lost the knack of preying on defenseless rich women. What can
I do? _ Disenfranchised
</P>
<P>
   Until recently you could have petitioned the National Endowment
for the Arts for a grant, but since the NEA is being forced to get
picky about what constitutes performance art, Dee Dee thinks that
you have no choice but to sue Darlene, Jerry Springer, and
everybody connected to the show for defamation of character, loss
of income, pain, suffering, and anything else you or your attorney
can think of. Good luck!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: Since I won the Lottery I worry that no one will
ever love me for myself. Actually, no one ever loved me for myself
before I won, and even now, with $32 million, I have trouble
getting a date. So how can I be sure? _ Pining
</P>
<P>
   Sure of what? That you're a loser? Dee Dee thinks that's pretty
obvious. She advises you to give away all your winnings to
charities and to worthy individuals such as herself who unselfishly
devote their lives to helping others. Only then can you be certain
that money plays no part in your failure to find love.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: Several of my multiple personalities jointly hold
a winning lottery ticket and can't agree on which one of them
should claim the money. They argue among themselves continually,
day and night. I am getting no sleep, and neither are the rest of
my personalities. We are just about at the end of our ropes. Help!
_ Exhausted
</P>
<P>
   Try to persuade the winners to see a financial adviser who
specializes in multiple personality issues andwho will arrange for
them to incorporate themselves before they claim the money. Dee Dee
understands that there may be certain tax advantages to this plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: My ex-husband's wife has won $10 million in the
lottery. I can't help but feel that the money is rightfully mine,
since I was married to him for 20 years and she's had to put up
with him for only the last six months. How can I convince her that
in the court of karmic justice the money should go to me? _
Cheated, Again
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee tends to agree that, karmically, most of the cash
probably should be yours, but as anyone who watches Judge Judy
knows, karma doesn't cut much ice in a traditional courtroom.

FIRST SHIPMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE TO ARRIVE IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shipments of radioactive nuclear fuel rods are
scheduled to begin passing through the San Francisco area this
month, according to the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   California Attorney General Dan Lungren declined Wednesday to
sue the federal government to stop or delay the shipments, angering
the state Coastal Commission, which asked the attorney general to
represent them in court.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Douglas, executive director of the commission, said he was
``really shocked ... frustrated and dismayed'' at Lungren's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an accident and the stuff spills and is exposed to
the environment, the consumer of fish poisoned (by the waste) is
going to avoid those fish knowing there's radioactive waste out
there,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Staci Turner, a spokeswoman for Lungren, said Wednesday she
could not comment on the issue. She cited attorney-client privilege
between Lungren's office and the Coastal Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren authorized the commission to sue on its own, but
commission members say they lack the money to hire a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Vice Chairwoman Sara Wan said that by declining to
sue, Lungren ``basically is taking away from the people of this
state the right to review or have a hearing about this issue. An
accident is possible. ... I'm not convinced that everything has
been done to maximize the safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, criticized
Lungren, a Republican who is running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, Dan Lungren is putting his own personal ideology
in front of his duties as attorney general,'' Davis said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 11 years, five shipments of radioactive fuel rods
are scheduled to be delivered through the Bay to the Concord Naval
Weapons Station. There, the shipments will be packed onto a freight
train and hauled through California, Nevada, Utah and Idaho. The
ultimate destination is a storage site at the Idaho National
Engineering and Environment Laboratory, a nuclear weapons
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The shipments are part of a national effort to retrieve
radioactive fuel rods from foreign reactors to prevent ``hot''
waste from being diverted for use in nuclear weapons or
radioactivity-dispersing chemical bombs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Energy Department spokesman John Belluardo
confirmed that the first shipment will arrive sometime this month.
He declined to identify the name of the ship or its precise course
before its planned arrival at the Naval Weapons Station.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipment involves about 360 fuel rods from South
Korea. The radioactive material originated in North Korean nuclear
plants and the United States agreed to dispose the material under
an agreement aimed at preventing the communist-led nation from
developing weapons of mass destruction.

US NEWS' FALLOWS: NO NEWS WAS BAD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This past Monday, as he was informing his staff that he had been
fired after almost two years at the helm, U.S. News &AMP; World Report
editor James Fallows revealed the journalistic priorities that may
have gotten him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the magazine made big news with its June 29 ``exclusive''
report on the Monica Lewinsky tapes. But in the message to his
staff, the outgoing editor lavished much praise on that issue's
``Retirement Guide,'' a 27-page primer on the virtues of the
401(k)and Roth IRA. The guide was vintage Fallows, more service
than scandal, more wonky than sexy. And maybe it explains why owner
Mort Zuckerman, in Fallows's words, wanted a ``change in
direction.'' (The magazine's editorial director Harold Evans
insisted it was his decision to fire Fallows.)
</P>
<P>
   As he turns over the reins to veteran news magazine manager
Stephen Smith, Fallows's legacy is likely to be a subject of heated
debate. Audited numbers at the end of 1997 show a total circulation
of 2.22 million with 57,300 newsstand sales, a slight rise in
single-copy sales and a slight drop in overall circulation from the
previous year. By comparison, Time is at 4.16 million circulation
and Newsweek is at 3.18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows _ keenly aware of the charge that he softened the
magazine by eschewing hard news for navel gazing _ told the staff
that no one should define his dispute with Zuckerman as ``a `news'
versus `non-news' dichotomy.'' But he left little doubt about his
priorities when recounting the magazine's achievements: enterprise
work that ``puts familiar topics in an entirely different light'';
the ``Silver Bullets'' concept of offering solutions to the
nation's thorniest problems; and ``service journalism...worth the
same care, creativity, and standards as any other kind of story.''
</P>
<P>
   This is in keeping with the reputation Fallows has earned _
thanks to his book ``Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine
American Democracy'' _ as a critic of journalism-as-usual and a
believer in the profession as a tool for civic improvement. The New
York Times' Maureen Dowd recently dubbed him the ``Rector of
American Journalism.'' Whether that's fair or not, it is hard to
see how someone so disdainful of the Beltway press corps could
successfully run a Washington-based news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the competition has opted for more
lifestyle-oriented coverage in recent years, U.S. News was often
furthest off the headlines. When Newsweek and Time splashed the
death of Frank Sinatra on the cover, U.S. News ran a story
explaining the drop in violent crime. When the big two played the
Arkansas schoolyard massacre on the cover, U.S. News went with an
uncompelling account of life aboard a U.S. submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows's vision was apparent in such cover stories as ``16
Silver Bullets'' which offered potential solutions to problems
ranging from teenage pregnancy to land mine casualties. And a March
cover story, ``Don't Die Before You Read This,'' may have been the
ultimate in quirky service journalism. The piece _ an expose of
corruption in the funeral industry _ examined everything from the
markup in casket prices to morticians who bribe clergymen and
advised people on how to avoid being ripped off in their moment of
grief. It was fascinating reading, but was it too weird to work?
</P>
<P>
   This raises the eternal question for the perennial show horse in
a three-horse field. Is U.S. News wiser to march to a different
drummer or battle Time and Newsweek in the trenches?
</P>
<P>
   That's a matter that henceforth, will furrow the brow of Smith,
49, an alum of the Daily Hampshire Gazette and The Boston Globe.
For Smith, who has been editing the National Journal, getting the
top slot at U.S. News comes as professional vindication. Twice
before he has just missed the brass ring.
</P>
<P>
   Having risen quickly through the ranks at Time magazine, Smith
took a Newsweek job in 1986 at a point when Henry Muller was going
to beat him out for the Time managing editor's job. He was
dismissed by Newsweek in 1991 after a contentious stay that ended
when his rival, Maynard Parker, won the battle for leadership of
the magazine, leaving Smith with a reputation for less than
world-class people skills.
</P>
<P>
   He has since worked his way back, toiling for Knight-Ridder,
founding Civilization magazine and moving to the National Journal.
Smith is widely praised for strong editing skills and as a
seasoned, smart magazine professional. And his admirers say that
his work in the past decade has earned him a return ticket to the
big time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I don't think anyone envisions any kind of sharp change in
direction,'' says Smith of his new job. ``My hope is to make as
clear as possible the distinctions between U.S. News and the other
two news magazines...Time and Newsweek are fighting for the same
readers and to an extent, define each other. We get to choose the
ground we fight on while they're locked in World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Smith's vision, there's always the question of whether
he'll get to execute it. At U.S. News, where he has a three-year
contract, he becomes Zuckerman's seventh editor in 14 years. And
any honeymoon there may be tempered by Harold Evans' response last
November when asked about rumors that Fallows' days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a new editor at U.S. News &AMP; World
Report,'' he declared.

`SMOKE SIGNALS' IS AN AMERICAN INDIE `EVENT' PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Native-American road picture, ``Smoke Signals,'' which
debuted locally as the ``mid-festival gala'' of the recent Seattle
International Film Festival and begins its regular run today, is
the closest thing we're likely to have this summer to an American
indie ``event'' picture.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it have a strong local connection (it's the first
offering of the Seattle-based ShadowCatcher Entertainment and
adapted from stories by Seattle author Sherman Alexie), it also won
both the Audience Award and Filmmaker's Trophy for best dramatic
film at the last Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   And it's laying claim to being the ``first full-length feature
film written, directed and co-produced by Native Americans,'' which
should guarantee it a high profile among critics, and a special
place (or at least an interesting footnote) in film history.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, all this hoopla and advance praise has turned out to be
more than just hype. The film is no earthshaker, but it's a funny,
charming, often poignant coming-of-age picture and all-around slice
of contemporary Indian life that just sparkles with authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Alexie's 1993 short story collection, ``The Lone Ranger
and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven,'' it's the story of two young Idaho
Indians: the athletic, charismatic and popular Victor Joseph (Adam
Beach) and his smaller, nerdy worshiper, Thomas Builds-the-Fire
(Evan Adams).
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a prologue set on the Fourth of July, 1988,
when a celebration at the Coeur d'Alene Indian reservation gets out
of hand, a fire breaks out, and a series of events ensue that
forces Arnold (Gary Farmer), father of the then-12-year-old Victor,
to desert his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 10 years later, and word reaches Victor and his mother
(Tantoo Cardinal) that Arnold has died in an Arizona trailer camp.
Victor feels obligated to bring back the ashes for burial, but,
with no money, the only way he can finance the trip is through his
ever-admiring pal Thomas, who insists on tagging along.
</P>
<P>
   From here, ``Smoke Signals'' segues into an enjoyable, if
familiar, mismatched-buddy road picture, with the two opposites
regularly attracting and repelling each another through a series of
picaresque experiences that leaves them, in the end, wiser and
better people.
</P>
<P>
   But it's extremely well done: cleverly scripted, almost
perfectly cast (Beach has the stuff of a major star), alternately
funny and touching, and thematically very effective, communicating
its serious message _ the plight of the American Indian _ with an
ingratiating, self-deprecating humor, rather than off-putting
anger.
</P>
<P>
   The only real flaw in the film is that the script has a certain
self-conscious tendency to relate every aspect of the characters'
lives to the ``Indian experience,'' which gradually gets tiresome
and often makes them come off less as living/breathing human beings
as literary devices designed to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals. Directed by Chris Eyre. Written by Sherman
Alexie. Cast: Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Tom Skerritt, Tantoo
Cardinal, Gary Farmer. Miramax. 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature
themes and language.

`CHERRY' IS AN IRANIAN VERSION OF ``IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE'

   Abbas Kiarostami's ``Taste of Cherry,'' which won the
prestigious Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, might be
described as a fancy-free Iranian version of Frank Capra's ``It's a
Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Its hero is an apparently well-off, middle-aged man named Badii
(Homayoun Ershadi), who, for reasons he never expresses, has
decided to kill himself and is driving around the dusty,
mountainous outskirts of Teheran in his Range Rover looking for
someone to help him.
</P>
<P>
   He's already dug a shallow grave, and he believes he's mustered
the courage to lie down in it and do the deed that night. But he
wants someone to come back in the morning to cover him up, or, if
he somehow fails to pull off the task successfully, to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up a young Kurdish soldier in the Iranian Army, then an
Afghan seminary student, then an old Turkish taxidermist who
collects specimens for a natural history museum. The soldier flees
in terror when he explains what he wants, and the others are almost
as reluctant to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The trio give him a succession of reasons why suicide is not a
good idea. Everything from Hamlet's fear of the unknown to the
religious stigma of breaking God's will to your basic humanistic
bias against squandering the sweet gift of life _ giving up ``the
taste of cherries.''
</P>
<P>
   A cynical reviewer might argue Capra told this same story a lot
more effectively and that the Palme d'Or is often politically
inspired, so the award might have less to do with cinematic
brilliance in this case than with the director's courage in dealing
with the taboo subject of suicide in a country still ruled by
strict Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiarostami (``Through the Olive Trees'') definitely has his
own distinctive sensibility and world-view, which come across
nicely; his film has a kind of lyrical and poetic beauty at the
same time it's remarkably free of sentimentality and didacticism;
and it tells its tale with the minimalist effectiveness of a
first-rate short story.
</P>
<P>
   Taste of Cherry. Directed, written and edited by Abbas
Kiarostami. Cast: Homayoung Ershadi, Abdolhossein Bagheri, Afshin
Bakhtiari, Ali Moradi. Zeitgeist Films. 95 minutes. In Farsi with
English subtitles. Unrated.

`THE KINGDOM II IS CONTAGIOUSLY ENTERTAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't nearly as ghostly, creepy or compelling as part one but
``The Kingdom II'' retains a contagiously entertaining flair _
though it pushes the boundaries of good taste onto gaudy,
far-fetched, soap opera turf.
</P>
<P>
   Director Lars von Trier, who developed the series for Danish TV,
presented similar contrasts of good versus evil and sacrifice in
love in his last film, the moving, acclaimed ``Breaking The
Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   He, along with co-director Morten Arnfred, expand on those
themes here as well as pitting old world ignorance and superstition
against modern science.
</P>
<P>
   And they've instilled this 4-hour installment with the same dark
comedy and unflagging energy that helped attain cult status for
``The Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge Copenhagen hospital known as The Kingdom was built atop
an ancient cloth bleaching ground and the ghosts of the laborers
who died in the pits haunt the hospital halls. Somewhere in the
bowels of the structure lurk Satanic forces and worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to a select group of the hospital staff and some psychic
and disabled patients to uncover who among them is the ``Grand
Duc'' to the devil himself.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Stig Helmer (Ernst-Hugo Jaregard), the Swedish consultant
who hates the Danish (``Danish scum,'' he spits), or could it be
his chief associate, Dr. Moesgaard (Holger Juul Hansen), the dim
bulb of the department? Whoever it is, it's up to Mrs. Drusse
(Kirsten Rolffes), an eternal patient who never seems to get
discharged, to rally the hospital's good spirits together to fight
the growing forces of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Part two as a whole is much lighter and more fantastical than
the original. ``The Kingdom II'' suffers from many of the same
problems as regular TV series and soap operas in that relatively
little happens over the four-hour time span. We're fooled into
thinking we've seen much more than we have. And once again, we're
left with a cliff-hanger of an ending which, according to von
Trier, will be resolved in the last episode of the trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   While part two is more ambitious _ it follows 11 stories instead
of the five or six that were tracked in the first series _ the
developments that occur are absurd and silly. The intriguing thing
about the initial show was its gothic creepiness and flight of
imagination and fancy. Here we see more, but that doesn't
necessarily make it better.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the final saga will sway back to the gothic tone of
the original. The traipses into zombie-ism and New Age spirituality
that trip up ``The Kingdom II'' are banal and the dark, dark sense
of dread and unknown that oozed through part one were far more
spooky.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdom II. Directed by Lars von Trier, Morten Arnfred.
Written by von Trier, Niels Vorsel. Cast: Ernst-Hugo Jaregard,
Kirsten Rolffes, Ghita Norby, Soren Pilmark. October Films. 286

rituals. In Danish with English subtitles.

BEHIND THE CURTAINS OF SOTHEBY'S

SOTHEBY'S 
Bidding for Class 
By Robert Lacey 
Little, Brown, 354 pp., Illustrated, $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're probably still safe in calling Sotheby's the world's most
famous auction house. Robert Lacey's wildly entertaining new book,
``Sotheby's _ Bidding for Class,'' demonstrates that it isn't the
oldest, as the firm has always claimed, nor, in some seasons, even
the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey's is the second book in a year to expose the Bond Street
auction house. Peter Watson's ``Sotheby's _ The Inside Story''
investigated the firm's habit of spiriting art out of its country
of origin without proper paperwork. Watson quoted an internal memo
_ ``Should we stop selling anything that might have been smuggled,
for PR reasons?'' _ that seems to sum up Sotheby's creative ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's book is highly focused. Lacey's is broader, a complete
history of the business that began as a London bookseller's,
expanded into fine art, conquered New York, and then went global.
Lacey opens with the spectacular 1996 sale of the effects of
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and quickly gets to the heart of the
matter _ what's under the auction house's gloss of refinement and
taste. ``The trick,'' he writes, ``is to persuade people who
already possess more than their fair share of worldly goods that
their happiness depends on acquiring even more.''
</P>
<P>
   This fiction is complemented by others. ``Founded in 1744,'' the
company's catalogs proclaim. Not so, counters Lacey. ``Started
trading under the name of Sotheby in 1778'' would be more accurate,
by which time the firm's great rival, Christie's, had been in
business for a dozen years. What's now called ``Sotheby's'' started
with one Samuel Baker, a freelance London book dealer who
bequeathed his business to his nephew John Sotheby. There hasn't
been a Sotheby in Sotheby's since the last of the line died in
1861, but no matter. Brand name recognition is the foundation of
the firm, whether it's their name or Van Gogh's. (Lacey offers an
amusing account of the failure of the Sotheby's cigarette, which
was supposed to bail the firm out of one of its periodic financial
crises.)
</P>
<P>
   The revolutions of 18th-century Europe meant that the treasures
of deposed nobles flooded London, making it the center of the
world's art trade. The collections of the great British country
houses were formed when then-new auction houses sold these spoils
of war to English dukes and earls. And when those aristocrats fell
on hard times, the auction houses helped them discreetly dispose of
their property, sending it still further west, as when Sotheby's
sold the duke of Devonshire's great library to the American
railroad tycoon H.E. Huntington in 1913 for $15.9 million in
today's money.
</P>
<P>
   What's even more fascinating than the mind-boggling prices that
culminate with Sotheby's 1987 sale of Van Gogh's ``Irises'' to
Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond for $49 million, money it turned
out he didn't have, is Lacey's analysis of how we got to that
point. For generations, auction houses peddled fair-to-middling
paintings, while dealers sold the stars. Consigning your great
Titian to an auction house wasn't considered nice. Nor was it nice
to turn up at an auction and bid in public. It took Sotheby's 1956
sale of Poussin's ``The Adoration of the Shepherds'' to break the
psychological barrier. The painting ended up in London's National
Gallery, its prestige intact. Collectors were suddenly eager to
unload their major masterpieces at auction, where bidding frenzies
might mean more money than they'd get from a closed-door deal with
a dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the bizarre characters who populate Lacey's book, Peter
Wilson tops the heap. Scion of an aristocratic family fallen on
hard times, Wilson, in a half-century association with Sotheby's,
created the firm we know today. Under his direction, Sotheby's
pioneered the notion of art as excellent investment _ which Lacey
disputes _ and glamorized what was considered a slightly shady
business through black-tie auctions attended by celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey doesn't spoil his string of deliciously disgusting
anecdotes about greed with moralizing. Nor does he spend much time
on actual art. Only once, in describing the ``Irises,'' does he wax
rhapsodic over a painting. Mostly, he lets the facts and follies
speak for themselves, and they're quite enough. Consider Sotheby's
1993 sale of the title to the abandoned moon rover, which is stuck
up there in perpetuity. The winning bid was $68,000. ``It was a
conceptual thing,'' said the presiding auctioneer, ``because true
collecting is not about the actual possession of objects.'' Can a
sale of the emperor's new clothes be far behind?

`THE HANGING GARDEN' IS LIKE A MODERN, ABSTRACT PAINTING) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director and writer Thom Fitzgerald was so hellbent on
exorcising his painful coming of age demons _ he left home at 18
and didn't return for 10 years after his mother learned he was gay
_ that he purposely chose to write the most furious ``non-literal''
script imaginable about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``The Hanging Garden,'' which won prizes at the
Toronto Film Festival and took home a Genie (the Canadian
equivalent of the Oscar) for best screenplay. That's high praise in
a year boasting Atom Egoyan's acclaimed ``The Sweet Hereafter'' as
competition.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the film labors to create a moody atmosphere in
which to present real _ or imagined _ family dramas that happened
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Sweet William (played by three actors, most
notably Troy Veinotte as the teenageer and Chris Leavins as the
adult), a once fat, now thin gay man who returns home after a
decade's absence to attend his snarly sister's wedding. Rosemary
(Kerry Fox) is marrying the fellow who was William's secret
adolescent heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return, his already simmering, faulty-wired family goes
completely berserk. His mother disappears, his alcoholic father,
who has tended the family garden with loving care, gets more
abusive, and his grandmother's Alzheimer's takes a turn for the
worse. In addition, Rosemary's mouth is more off-color than ever
and there's a new little sister who is surly and sullen.
</P>
<P>
   During the short weekend, William uncovers a dark secret that
puts a curious spin on his past flight from his family's remote
Nova Scotia homestead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hanging Garden'' is shaped and textured much like an
abstract, modern painting in that it's open to interpretation and
different points of view. While urging viewers to think and use
their imaginations is a welcome change from formulaic movie fare,
the film unfortunately permutates into what feels more like
incidental, lazy storytelling. It might want to be a film about
forgiveness and redemption, but it hasn't the heart, warmth or
depth to tackle such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem is that William is such a passive character
that his investment and intimacy in telling the story isn't
apparent. It may be his life, but most of the time he's
non-existent. Consequently, his family looms large and out of
control next to his quiet reserve, and we have no one to guide us
through the mayhem _ or to identify with.
</P>
<P>
   It all spirals back to Fitzgerald's frustration over movies and
books that are literal and linear. But by stubbornly refusing to
give us information, he takes his film too far in the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Even a metaphor like the garden, which is visually opulent and
lush to the point of decay and represents a place of birth and
death, never resonates with as much power as it should because we
can't care about the characters and the tragedies that occur there.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanging Garden. Directed and written by Thom Fitzgerald.
Cast: Kerry Fox, Chris Leavins, Sarah Polley, Troy Veinotte.
Goldwyn Films. 91 minutes. Rated R for sexual themes, language, gay
themes, nudity.

LINUX'S WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a few weeks in the company of Linux, I'm convinced that
Microsoft Corp. CEO Bill Gates deserves his billions.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Linux. It's the free operating system software
developed in part by the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge,
Mass. Linux has between 5 million and 7 million users worldwide,
depending on who you ask, and it's beginning to offer a head-on
challenge to Microsoft's Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back I vowed to try running Linux on my home
machine, instead of Windows 95. I'm no Microsoft-basher; I'm just
sick of the company's arrogance and eager for a high-quality
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Since then I've received dozens of e-mails from around the
world. A few suggested that I skip Linux and switch to an Apple
Macintosh instead. But these were far outnumbered by messages from
faithful Linux users, as well as fence-sitters wondering whether
they should take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not surprised by the response. Even most faithful Mac users
know that their favorite computer has reached a commercial dead
end. But today's Mac is a technology dead end as well--along with
Microsoft's DOS and Windows 95, and even the shiny new Windows 98.
None of these operating systems is designed to take full advantage
of today's hot processor chips.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is well aware of this. All of its future releases for
home and business will be built around the more sophisticated
Windows NT. This software is Microsoft's effort to emulate the
sophisticated Unix operating system that runs most of the computers
on the Internet. Meanwhile, Apple's next-generation operating
system, Mac OS X, is set to roll out next year. OS X will be based
upon a Unix work-alike called Mach.
</P>
<P>
   Notice a trend here? The Unix way of doing things holds a lot of
appeal, because Unix and its various clones like Linux tend to be
more crash-resistant, even when you're running several programs at
once. That's because Linux will assign each program its own chunk
of memory to play in, with other programs ordered to keep out.
Windows 95 tries to do the same, but it frequently fails, leading
to those amusing ``general protection fault'' crashes. Windows NT
goes a long way toward fixing this problem, for as much as $800 a
pop. But Linux is free.
</P>
<P>
   So why go with Windows? Well, maybe you'd like to get some work
done.
</P>
<P>
   I get paid to fiddle with computers, and so I had a ball writing
script files and sending desperate e-mails to Linux gurus. Linux
harkens back to the Heroic Age of computing, when you actually had
to know something about your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Any of you weenies can insert a floppy disk on a PC or Mac. With
Linux, I have to shove in the disk, and then type a magical
incantion in computerese, too complicated to repeat here. You PC
and Mac users don't have to understand what's really happening when
you're swapping disks or installing a new piece of software. You
point, you click, you get busy.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what 95 percent of all computer users want to do. My
Linux adventure has heightened my respect for the hardworking
coders at Apple and, yes, even Microsoft. Bill Gates has earned his
money by giving us colorful, convenient software that shields us
from the brute realities of computing. Until Linux also gets a
simple and attractive user interface like Windows NT, it'll only be
popular with tightwads and arrested-development types like me. In
addition, Linux needs high-quality software from reputable
companies if it's to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there's movement on both fronts. Netscape
Communications Corp. has a solid version of its Web browser running
on Linux, and Corel Computer Corp. also offers its excellent
WordPerfect program. Indeed, Corel says they're bringing out an
entire office suite for Linux--word processor, spreadsheet, the
works. Meanwhile, a band of German software designers have created
KDE, a user interface that comes mighty close to civilizing Linux.
While it still needs a lot of work, my KDE-Linux setup qualifies
for the junior varsity in the ease-of-use league.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft just announced that the next version of Windows NT
will be delayed again. It probably won't see daylight till next
year. I'd call that a window of opportunity for Linux.

 Light is shed on morning-after pill
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The morning-after pill must be taken within 72 hours of
unprotected intercourse _ but a woman needs to go get a doctor's
prescription for the pill, making that time frame difficult to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   A prescription has long been thought necessary to prevent women
from using the emergency contraception inappropriately or unsafely.
</P>
<P>
   Now a study has found that such a pill, essentially a high-dose
birth control pill, can be safely made available to women without
their having to go to a doctor every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study suggests that women are able to self-administer
emergency contraception correctly, at the appropriate time, and
without adverse effects,'' write the researchers from Edinburgh in
the current New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers gave one group of about 500 women a supply of
pills to take home, while another group of about 500 women had to
go to a doctor's office for the pill.
</P>
<P>
   The women who got the take-home supply were not more likely to
use the pills repeatedly, to forgo using other contraceptive
methods, nor to experience serious side effects than were those who
went to the doctor. Yet while 25 women in the doctor's office group
had an unintended pregnancy, only 18 among the take-home supply
group did. Those numbers, however, were too small to establish
statistical significance.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial welcoming the study, Dr. Phillip
Stubblefield of Boston University Medical Center writes, ``If
emergency contraception were made available without a prescription,
it would be used more often and could be expected to reduce the
number of unwanted pregnancies.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-dose birth control pill is not approved in the United
States specifically as a morning-after pill, but US physicians are
authorized to write prescriptions for licensed drugs for
nonapproved uses. The pill is not the same as the controversial
abortion pill, RU-486, which has not been licensed to be marketed
in this country for any use.

<P>
   Good and bad news for people who suffer from low back pain.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: A study finds that low back pain sufferers are
just as likely to get appropriate spinal manipulation from
chiropractors as patients with other health problems are to get
appropriate medical procedures from physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: Only 46 percent of the spinal manipulation _ or
``back cracking,'' as it is sometimes called _ met guidelines for
appropriateness, while 29 percent of the care was inappropriate.
For the rest, treatment was deemed uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The study, considered the most thorough analysis yet of spinal
manipulation, is in the current Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs to stop treating chiropractors as if they are
quacks. An appropriateness rate of roughly half is in the same
ballpark as the findings for certain medical procedures when
appropriateness measures were introduced a dozen years ago,'' said
Dr. Paul G. Shekelle, an author of the study. At the same time, he
added, ``clearly, a 29 percent inappropriateness rate is too high
and should be decreased.''

<P>
   Statistics show that black men die at a higher rate from
prostate cancer than white men do, but they don't show why.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have theorized that black men have less access
to health care, and thus get diagnosed later, when the cancer is
more deadly. Others have suggested the cancer is biologically more
virulent in black men.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current issue of the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute explores that question by looking at prostate
cancer survival rates for black and white men belonging to the same
HMO _ where access to care is theoretically equal.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, the researchers from Stanford and the Kaiser
Permanente health maintenance organization looked at the survival
rate for black and white men who did not belong to the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 21,000 men, both HMO members and nonmembers,
the researchers found the prostate cancer death rate for black men
was more than 20 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results argue strongly that racial differences in
prostate cancer survival are not due solely to inequalities in
access to health care,'' the researchers conclude. ``The findings
are most compatible with the hypothesis of increased tumor
virulence in black men.''

   Although the show, organized by guest curator Beth Sellars,
spans more than 60 years with 200 paintings, drawings and prints,
its organization is only loosely chronological.
</P>
<P>
   Sellars thinks Lawrence's work bears directly on his life, that,
in essence, he paints an extended autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   The idea sounds good on paper and has a striking amount of truth
in it. Played out on the gallery walls, however, it becomes a
puzzling mannerism, with stray paintings from, say, the 1940s
popping up amid other works from a decade earlier, just because
they illustrate some point of biography.
</P>
<P>
   Retrospectives usually follow the artist's chronology, with
beginnings, middles and ends. If not, there has to be a compelling
visual reason. This show doesn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Painting Life'' is still terrific, even something
of a miracle. Given roughly six months to put it together, Sellars
managed to secure a significant number of key loans from across the
country and deliver a credible version of Lawrence's career.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the fact the Henry gave itself half a year
instead of the more common year and a half or two years to mount a
major show means there's no catalog. It also means the exhibit
won't travel _ a missed opportunity since there hasn't been a major
Lawrence retrospective since a 1986 Seattle Art Museum show that
traveled to five major venues around the country, breaking
attendance records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting Life'' opens in the first gallery with 30 paintings
from the ``Migration Series,'' completed in 1940, when Lawrence was
23. The full narrative cycle of 60 paintings charts the flow of
Southern blacks to the North, leaving Jim Crow oppressions in hopes
of better lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence was quickly tagged as a Social Realist, although like
every other movement that would come along in this century, he
didn't fit it.
</P>
<P>
   What the ``Migration Series'' actually represents is a young
artist making uncanny use of his technical limitations and mining
one of his essential gifts, the instinct for economy.
</P>
<P>
   Because he couldn't mix colors with any degree of accuracy, he
stuck to primary and secondary shades laid on straight from the
jar. And because he hadn't yet mastered the rendering of fluid
volumes, he reduced his figures to the starkest of shapes. With a
limited palette and simplified forms, his striking compositional
sense lifted his work into virtuoso accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the gallery with ``Migration'' are a suite of paintings
he did earlier of Harlem street scenes. At 19, he painted the
magnificent ``Street Orator.''
</P>
<P>
   The only visible part of the painting's namesake is his striped
cuffed pants and shoes disappearing up a ladder in the foreground
as their owner ascends to his platform. The real subject is, as
ever for Lawrence, the audience. Pressed against the rungs of the
ladder and looking up, they have a German Expressionist intensity
without the usual angst, rancor or blight.
</P>
<P>
   Also from 1936 is ``Ice Man.'' Hung from a large hook on the
front of the rickety old cart is an ice tong, tenderly carved in
black and given its full sculptural dimension, the first of the
tools that will appear again and again in his work throughout his
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ``Migration Series,'' the great cycles of narrative
paintings done in his youth in the 1940s include ``Toussaint
L'Ouverture,'' inspired by the Haitian Revolution of 1795;
``Frederick Douglass,'' ``Harriet Tubman'' and ``John Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting Life'' has half of ``Migration,'' and no ``Frederick
Douglass'' or ``Harriet Tubman'' from this period. ``Toussaint''
appears in print form, as 16 serigraphs from 1986 to 1998, as does
``John Brown,'' with 22 serigraphs from 1977.
</P>
<P>
   These narrative cycles remain the most famous of his career.
With their fierce scale shifts and glowing masses of high-toned
color popping out like fire bursts in variegated seas of brown,
they register on the nerve endings with a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   Gems from the 1940s in this show include ``The Apartment,'' a
clear statement of another lifelong theme, how people living in
dire poverty sometimes manage to find a grace note.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment in question is cramped and the woman walking
through it, coming home from work, is bent with trouble. Around
her, however, are the riotous blessings of inanimate objects.
Flowers woven into a throw rug are strewn at her feet, and a
Picasso-like crazy face made from liquid-light circles looms out
from a gold rug hung on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Lawrence had become adept at mixing colors and
rendering fluid volumes. ``Diners'' from 1942 is undoubtedly a
dive, but the turquoise curtains hung on rods of gold and patterned
with creeping black vines are praise poems to the virtues of cheap
charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rooftops'' from 1943 is a celebration of syncopated life of
color found in hand-painted signs, billboard advertising, church
spires and the pleasures of a vertical life in rundown high-rises,
with room for your body and maybe a potted plant.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence continued working on his Harlem series in the 1940s,
interpreted by service in the Coast Guard, where he became a
shipboard artist.
</P>
<P>
   The world continues to pitch and sway in Lawrence's Coast Guard
paintings, especially ``Cmbar Katian'' from 1944. He painted
soldiers from the back who were packed into a ship's hold on a
strong diagonal: green helmets, backpacks and red flares. In the
foreground, a railing breaks the diagonal flow. Under it, soldiers
break formation, the green cones of their covered heads lurching in
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, he was hospitalized for nine months for depression. His
spirit muted, he nevertheless continued to draw with unfettered
fluency, making bodies that sag with the gravity of their illnesses
and objects that try to lift them up: weavings and quilts, saws and
planks, strings and fabrics flying.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he began a brilliant series relating to
performances and masked parties. Lawrence had begun to pick up some
criticism for being decorative, and these paintings are decorative
with a vengeance. In ``Concert'' from 1952, vines burst through
walls on the stage to curl into a grand piano, blooming everywhere
but around the pianist, whose pale dress looks like a prism of
fractured ice.
</P>
<P>
   The large, benign figures in ``Iyo'' from the Nigerian series of
1964 resemble Romare Bearden's in their heavy, misshapened faces,
hands and feet. Only Lawrence, however, would drape them in fabrics
full of luminous air and colored light.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s also saw the advent of his ``Civil Rights'' series,
which continued into the 1970s with the famed ``Confrontation at
the Bridge,'' represented here in serigraph form. In the 1970s, he
began his ``Builder'' series, which continues to the present day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting Life'' has a choice selection of ``Builders,''
including ``No. 1'' from 1972. Nails are laid out in front of a
formidable carpenter like jewels before a king, silky and softly
shadowed piles of blue, grays and golds.
</P>
<P>
   The man himself is muscled for his tasks and serene like the
Buddha. His bounty attracts Mount Rainier. From a rear window, it
strains toward him in snow-peak splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Lawrence's finest series have emerged in the last two
decades: ``Genesis'' from 1990, ``Hiroshima'' from 1983 and
``Supermarket'' from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Eight Sermons of the Creation from the Book of Genesis''
are hung in ``Painting Life'' in print form, while ``Hiroshima''
and ``Supermarket'' are in gouache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genesis'' traces the world's origins and ``Hiroshima'' its
end, playing across the spectrum from joy to horror.
</P>
<P>
   No one touching the theme of nuclear war has risen to the
standard Lawrence sets. The ground cracks and the hapless figures
on it are frozen in the act of becoming their shadows. As they
lament, they are baking down to their bones.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Genesis'' and ``Supermarket,'' Lawrence has all of the
fluid energy he developed in the 1940s, but in this later work his
polish and density, force and grace, work together to achieve
symphonic greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the exhibition are two paintings by Gwen Knight,
Lawrence's wife of 57 years. Small bust portraits in oil on canvas,
one shows the artist herself, poised and self-protective, casting a
cool eye at the viewer. Lawrence, in contrast, more than fills his
picture frame. Done in golden brown tones, the patina of old
bronze, his face radiates warmth and open affection.
</P>
<P>
   Across the span of more than 60 years, Lawrence has treated the
human figure and the flow of human figures as they mistreat,
defend, comfort and challenge each other. Through purely visual
means, he has expanded our collective notions of own history and
honored our rarely honored heroes and heroines. While the size of
his work is usually modest, its scale is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   What Herman Melville wrote about the Mississippi River is true
of Lawrence's human dramas, that they are ``dashing and all-fusing
spirits'' uniting the streams of the ``most distant and opposite
zones'' and pouring themselves along, ``helter-skelter, in one
cosmopolitan and confident tide.''

BETH BAUER`S FUTURE IS OPEN ENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Barbara McIntire has stood up to golf pressure
before, but this time it was rather awkward. The two-time US
Women's Amateur champion was asked about the Curtis Cup team she
will captain in August, in particular her youngest player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said McIntire, addressing a group of reporters,
``I have never met Beth personally 'til seeing her right here on
the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the opportunity, the moderator said, ``Barbara, this is
Beth. Beth, this is Barbara.''
</P>
<P>
   There was laughter and smiles, but the introduction was
symbolmatic because today, a teenage phenom steps up on a stage
that has seemingly been waiting for her. Golf world, meet Beth
Bauer. Beth Bauer, meet the golf world.
</P>
<P>
   She is 18 years old and in the fall she will be a freshman at
Duke University. Her stature in the golf world has grown rapidly,
from a great talent, to a dominant junior player, to a teenager who
arguably could step right into professional golf. That won't
happen, she says, because college is definitely in her plans, but
when they tee it up today in the 53d US Women's Open at Blackwolf
Run, Bauer will test her much talked about game against the world's
best. She seems prepared, which should not be a surprise because if
there's such a thing as grooming someone to play golf, we may be
looking at the female version of Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   John Bauer introduced his daughter to golf and it didn't take
long for him to realize there was something special. So like
hundreds of parents, John and Christine poured their energy and
financial resources into Beth's career. There was never a shortage
of events, from the American Junior Golf Association circuit, to
the PGA Junior Maxfli, to USGA competitions, with the tab running
as much as $20,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was seen as an investment in a professional golf career,
and always there have been dividends in the form of victories.
Twenty-five national wins, 16 of them being AJGA events, the major
league of junior golf. But no victory meant more, or came with such
eye-opening ease, as last summer's USGA Girls' Junior. At the
Legends Club of Tennessee, Bauer set 18- and 36-hole records with
qualifying rounds of 68 and 66 to win medalist honors by a whopping
seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   She then marched through match play, won the championship, and
accepted another trophy. Only this time, the victory felt somewhat
hollow. She had been trained for this, but there was something
missing. The golf had been easy, but the ceremony ... well, it was
impossible. Bauer cried, and those close to her knew why. Her
father deserved the spotlight, too, but he was sorely missed.
</P>
<P>
   John Bauer had died three years earlier at the age of 41. He had
taken Beth to the PGA Junior Championship when he collapsed. Rushed
to the hospital, he had only one request _ that his daughter go on
with the tournament. Her father's condition deteriorated quickly,
but Beth was never told how bad the situation was. She won the
championship, but three days later real life came crashing down on
her _ her father died as a result of something called Guillain
Barre syndrome, a neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Life has gone on, so has the golf, but she rarely plays a golf
shot without remembering her father. ``I think about my dad and
always try to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Her best has been quite impressive and if recent form is any
indication, perhaps she is as good as advertised. Consider the
results of a spur decision. ``My coach at Duke called me about a
month ago and asked me play in these two amateur championships (the
Women's Southern Amateur and Women's North &AMP; South). Luckily I went
out and I really played well and won them both.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt about her selection to the Curtis Cup
team (the amateur women's version of the Ryder Cup), there was none
now. Bauer, so long a talked-about name in junior golf circles, was
now an elite name. And with the team selection came an exemption
into the US Women's Open, which may be too much, too soon, except
the world today isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 18 or 19 today,'' said Nancy Lopez, ``isn't what being
18 or 19 was back then.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sally Little can vouch for that. Today, Little will look at the
young teenager in her pairing, but she won't see something that
brings back memories. ``When I was 17, we never had that many
tournaments, just one a year,'' said Little. ``When I was 18, I
came over to play professionally to get experience. The women's
tour is where I trained.''
</P>
<P>
   The South African native was LPGA Tour Rookie of the Year in
1971, the year after Bauer was born. She is 46 now and winless
since the third of her major titles, the 1988 du Maurier Classic,
but like Bauer, Little is here for a reason. ``I'm not here for
nostalgia purposes,'' said Little, who was denied a US Women's Open
victory in a playoff loss to Jane Geddes in 1986. ``I feel as a
player I have not achieved my potential. I love competing.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that competition is a wide-eyed teenager with her own
personal coach and a machine-like swing that has been grooved by
years of training, so be it. ``To me it doesn't matter,'' said
Little. ``I've hit against (Joanne) Carner and (Beth) Daniel. When
I tee it up in a national open, I think I've got a tremendous
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer would not argue that point. ``The course is longer than
I'm used to. (In junior events) I'm usually hitting 5-iron or less
into the par-4s, but out here I'm hitting 3-woods. It's going to
test my short game and long irons.''
</P>
<P>
   When reminded that she had shot 76-70-72-72 to tie for 16th in
her only other appearance in a professional tournament _ the
Nabisco Dinah Shore in March _ Bauer tugged at the Titleist cap
that is pulled tightly on her head, the brim bent the way kids wear
them these days. That means nothing this week, she said. ``I would
like to make the cut. That would be my first goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The future goals are not so modest, of course, and there are
those who think Bauer is being polite, that she has the game to
compete right now. ``We may be seeing the best American woman
golfer of our time,'' said Rhonda Glenn of the USGA, who has
authored several books on women's golf. ``I can't think of anyone
who has done as much as her at her age.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Under a scorching sun, Bauer was at work Wednesday, listening to
her caddie and coach, Phil Krick, who knows what it is to compete.
Years ago, he was what they called a rabbit, one of those guys who
had to play in Monday qualifiers just to get into PGA Tour events.
He didn't fare well, but he learned a lot about being
tournament-tough. It's part of the package that he hopes to pass on
to Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   As Bauer played her practice round, an interested bystander
walked several yards behind. ``She's impressive, very impressive,''
said McIntire, who was finally getting a chance to see the
youngster play.
</P>
<P>
   On the 540-yard, par-5 16th, a typical Pete Dye creation that
has a tree on the leftside of the fairway 25 yards in front of the
green, Bauer's layup off a nice drive was pulled left. She looked
at Krick, who shook his head in in disapproval. His player would be
blocked out by the tree, and he pointed firmly to right side of the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer reloaded and rifled a 3-wood down the middle, which cut
slightly and settled in perfect position for a wedge into the
green.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson learned for the young lady who has been studying
for this test for most of her young life. Today, the curtain rises
on what many predict will be a bright golf future.

AT 80, LAWRENCE IS STILL SEARCHING FOR `SOMETHING ELSE'  
 (WITH RETROSPECTIVE-JACOB-LAWRENCE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ By the time Jacob Lawrence got to Harlem, the party
was over. The flush days of Harlem's cultural renaissance had come
to an abrupt end with the 1929 stock market crash and the beginning
of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Lawrence was in a position to judge his neighborhood's
sagging fortunes. In 1930, at age 13, he wasn't prepared to lead
anything close to the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1917 in Atlantic City, N.J., to a couple who had come
North in the general migration of blacks out of the South, he found
little he could count on in his early years.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 13, his father was long gone. He and younger
brother and sister had spent three years in foster care before
their mother could afford to send for them. She was a domestic with
an irregular income, barely able to hold her family together.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, he was shocked by the lack of open space, the crush
of humanity and the cramped verticality of the buildings. Because
he neither played sports or followed them, he wasn't a big hit with
his contemporaries. Nor was he especially drawn to school.
</P>
<P>
   What follows from such beginnings? Predictably, he became a high
school dropout, leaving to help his mother earn a living. His
sister died early from tuberculous, his brother from a drug
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   And yet his story is one of resounding successes, with triumphs
coming fast and early and sustaining themselves throughout a long
and productive life. To date, he has received 20 honorary
doctorates, membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters,
the National Council of the Arts and the National Academy of
Design, as well as scores of significant citations, prizes and
foundation grants.
</P>
<P>
   Two retrospective exhibits featuring his work have toured the
country to record-breaking crowds (organized by the Whitney Museum
of American Art in 1974 and the Seattle Art Museum in 1986). Two
similarly popular touring exhibits, both in 1994, featured his
early work: one featuring series charting the careers of
anti-slavery activists Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass and
the other the ``Migration Series.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his radically changing fortunes as a youth,
Lawrence is quick to give credit where it belongs: to Harlem's
black community. He doesn't mean only Harlem's extraordinary
grouping of painters, musicians, poets and playwrights who
befriended him, but the ordinary people with whom he interacted
every day.
</P>
<P>
   His first Harlem break came right away. ``My mother wanted me to
be safe when I wasn't at school, so she enrolled me in an arts and
crafts program at Utopia House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the staff was painter Charles Alston, who immediately
recognized the young man's drawing talent. Alston provided him with
materials and some technical information, but let him build his
painted, cutout cardboard cities on his own.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Lawrence continued to study with Alston, who
became director of the Harlem Art Workshop funded by the WPA Mural
Project for the Federal Art Project.
</P>
<P>
   Alston ran an intellectual salon. Through him, Lawrence met poet
Langston Hughes, painter Aaron Douglas, writers Ralph Ellison and
Claude McCay. Before Lawrence was out of his teens, McCay was
hailing him as a ``peerless delineator of the Harlem scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Another important mentor was sculptor Augusta Savage. When
Lawrence dropped out of high school to earn money, taking on a
series of mind-numbing menial jobs, Savage tried to get him
employment as a WPA artist. The first time she took him, he was too
young. The following year, she remembered and brought him back down
to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the first person to give me the idea of being an
artist as a job,'' he said. ``I always wanted to be an artist, but
I assumed I'd have to work in laundry or something of that
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The heady company he kept encouraged his intellectual interests,
and he spent many hours in the Harlem library, studying the history
of African Americans, research that would result in his first great
cycles of narrative paintings.
</P>
<P>
   He also accompanied various mentors on trips to downtown
galleries and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, eventually going by
himself on foot, 60 blocks south of his home territory. While still
a teenager, he had developed an appreciation of early Renaissance
art, the murals of Jose Orozco and the paintings of Arthur Dove,
John Marin and Kathe Kollwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The credit goes to Savage for introducing Lawrence to Gwen
Knight, a young painter from Barbados whom he married in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   That was a big year for Lawrence. Art dealer Edith Halpert
included his ``Migration'' series in a show in her Downtown
Gallery, where the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., and the
Museum of Modern Art immediately began vying to purchase it. When
neither would give way, the series was split, with 30 paintings
going to each institution. He was the first African American artist
to be represented by a major New York gallery and to have a solo
exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel discovered (at that point),'' Lawrence said in
an interview this week. ``I'd already been discovered by my own
community. It had prepared me for success.''
</P>
<P>
   The community had also given him a lifetime of themes to ponder.
``I used to hang around a group of brothers who were cabinet
makers, the Bates brothers,'' he said. ``I'd watch them working
with their tools, never thinking they'd represent my content in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy and diversity of Harlem moved him as well. He
remembers taking a stroll and passing Marcus Garvey's messengers or
even the great man himself exhorting Harlem's citizens to return to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Vying with Garvey for atteniton were communists and labor
organizers, preachers of old and new faiths, musicians with their
hats out, sellers of trinkets and healing potions, jump ropers and
crap shooters, old people sitting on stoops and little kids darting
in and out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 he was baptized in the Abyssinian Baptist Church and
remembers the ringing sermons of the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Sr.,
the model for his ``Genesis'' minister 50 years later. Lawrence was
particularly fond of Powell's ringing ``old bones'' sermon from the
Prophet Ezekiel: ``Son of Man, can these bones live?''
</P>
<P>
   Knight and Lawrence went to New Orleans for their honeymoon,
experiencing Jim Crow laws for the first time: the segregated
drinking fountains, dining and buses. ``We just did what everybody
else did,'' said Knight. ``We sat in the back of the bus and ate in
the restricted areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence nodded. ``But I don't think we felt real hatred in New
Orleans. It was too cosmopolitan a city for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight remembered waiting at a lunch counter for a seat and one
being empty at the end of the white section. ``A (white) man just
moved the sign over so the empty seat was in the black section. I
said thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph Albers invited Lawrence to teach at Black Mountain
College in North Carolina, the school hired a separate compartment
on the train so that the Lawrences wouldn't have to endure the
inferior segregated sections. ``We just stayed in our room,'' said
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   And once at the college, they didn't dare leave it to go into
town. ``Nobody told us we couldn't leave, but nobody encouraged us
to either,'' said Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 1950s, Lawrence discovered that he enjoyed teaching,
thanks to a offer at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. After an
8-month trip to Nigeria, he was appointed an instructor at the New
School for Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's mother died in 1968, after he had become a major
figure in the art world. ``She was proud, but she would have been
much happier if I'd had a job in the civil service,'' he said.
``For people of her generation, security was everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he was offered a full professor, tenured faculty
position at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never intended to stay more than 3 or 4 years,'' he said.
``But we established relationships and made commitments. It was a
gradual thing. I've always felt fortunate to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, he and his wife lived in a modest bungalow
within walking distance of the university.
</P>
<P>
   Classic New Yorkers, neither ever learned to drive. They now
live in a retirement complex on First Hill, which is nice without
being at all luxurious. They live modestly. Only this year could
their dealer Francine Seders persuade them to fly first class on

</P>
<P>
   With little interest in the high life and a steady appreciation
of his own worth, Lawrence has been able to pace himself and
produce a great flowering in his later years.
</P>
<P>
   For his entire career, he has been odd man out from the art
mainstream. In the 1940s, he was considered a raw talent,
unschooled, even though he had been rigorously schooled by the
generation of Harlem artists who preceded him. In the 1950s and
1960s, he was considered decorative. As a figurate painter, he was
an odd man out in the New York art scene dominated by Abstract
Expressionism from the mid-'40s through the '50s. Nor was he any
closer to the movements that replaced it: Pop, Industrial Process,
Conceptualism and finally, in the '80s, Neo-Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1986 SAM retrospective revived his career, his name
didn't come up much in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he has produced close to 1,100 works, estimated art
historican Peter Nesbett, director of the Jacob Lawrence Catalogue
Raisonne Project, an attempt to find and document all of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence has continued to push the boundaries of what he can do,
retaining his edge as he increases his mastery, maybe because he
never allowed the spotlight to become essential.
</P>
<P>
   At 80, he still seeks to break new aesthetic ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search goes on for something else,'' he says. ``I don't
know what it is _ some other dimension I still hope to find.''

POPCORN IS JUST LETTING OFF STEAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Why does popcorn pop?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.N., Joshua, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The pop occurs because of steam pressure that can't escape
the popcorn kernel any other way. Ideally, the unpopped kernel
contains approximately 13 percent moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly Time, which began selling popcorn in 1914, answers your
question on its World Wide Web site at www.jollytime.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kernel of popcorn is like a little steam engine,'' the
site says. Cracks in the kernel cause unpopped or partially popped
corn.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1930s, popping problems prevented the product from
prospering, Jolly Time postulates. ``It was just too darn
unpredictable. Sometimes the kernels would pop ... and sometimes
they would just sit there and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Lea Thompson of ``Caroline in the City''
and buy a poster or other merchandise from the show?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.A.S., Hayward, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Thompson in care of the Gersh Agency, Box 5617,
Beverly Hills, Calif. 90210.
</P>
<P>
   No posters turn up, but the NBC Store in New York City sells
four different ``Caroline'' T-shirts and a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   These can be ordered by calling (800) 622-8760 or visiting the
World Wide Web page www.nbc.com/shop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Victor Mature star in ``The Glory Brigade,'' a movie
about Greek soldiers during the Korean War? Also, where can I write
to him?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.O., Ridgefield Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: In the 1953 film, Mature played Lt. Sam Pryor, a
Greek-American who escorts troops from Greece on a reconnaissance
mission behind Communist lines.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can write to the 82-year-old actor and avid golfer at Box
706, Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. 92067.
</P>
<P>
   If the city sounds familiar, it's the community of 12,000 where
the Higher Source cult suicide took place in March 1997.

A DIFFERENT TREATMENT FOR GULF WAR SYNDROME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh for decades has
specialized in unearthing deeply buried government secrets and
recounting them in massive book-length treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with his 1969 expos &UR; gfacute &LR; e of the My Lai massacre
in Vietnam, in which a company of American soldiers gunned down
several hundred civilians, to his best seller last year, ``The Dark
Side of Camelot,'' which plumbed in depth the disturbing side of
John F. Kennedy's life, ranging from sexual misconduct to mafia
connections, Hersh has set a standard for thorough, in-depth
research.
</P>
<P>
   But in his latest project, an account of the mysterious Gulf War
Syndrome that has stricken more than 90,000 American veterans of
the Persian Gulf War, Hersh has taken a radically different tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against All Enemies,'' (Library of Contemporary Thought, 103
pages, $8.95), is actually an in-depth magazine article formatted
into a soft-cover book format. Unlike his massive treatment of the
Kennedys, which required more than four years of full-time research
and spanned nearly 500 pages, Hersh wrote the 103-page Gulf War
project in four months. And speed did not necessarily translate
into loss of depth on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a tough, concise account of how the Pentagon,
military doctors, the Veterans Administration and White House
botched one of the biggest medical mysteries to emerge from combat
since the Agent Orange defoliant scandal from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Hersh writes, there was not so much a deliberate
coverup of wrongdoing as a mindset to disbelieve an increasingly
credible avalanche of data.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning less than a year after the end of hostilities in the
Arabian desert in March 1991, a steadily increasing number of
veterans from the massive allied deployment began contracting a
baffling array of symptoms, including bone and joint aches, blurred
vision, night sweats and short-term memory loss. Until last year,
government experts dismissed the medical complaints as stemming
from stress, Hersh notes, a characterization insinuating the
veterans were imagining their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether it (the source) is real or from
stress,'' Hersh said in a telephone interview this week. ``They are
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh was in Seattle Wednesday to discuss his Gulf War Syndrome
research at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh's book does not significantly break new ground in
revealing causes of the medical ailments, but it does succinctly
review how a growing number of activist veterans, concerned
congressmen and medical experts were able to overcome the
inattention and inertia of the Pentagon, White House and major news
media.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he says, our increasing awareness of Gulf War
Syndrome and revelation of a host of potential health threats
(depleted uranium ammunition, Iraqi chemical and biological
stockpiles that survived the war, experimental drugs given soldiers
to protect them from the Iraqi materials) firmly repudiate the
televised smart-bomb image of Operation Desert Storm as a ``clean''
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into this because of a father of one of the kids who
called me,'' Hersh said. ``I heard something I hadn't heard since
Vietnam: a radicalized father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a parent myself and very sensitive
</P>
<P>
   to a parent talking about a son dying,'' he
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh's book is the latest of a series of in-depth journalism
from the Library of Contemporary Thought, a publishing initiative
by the Ballantine Publishing Group that has been releasing similar
paperback treatments on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said the concept is needed because major magazines such as
The New Yorker no longer can accommodate full-length investigative
articles. Other works published under the series have included
``Team Rodent'' by Carl Hiaason, a critical examination of the Walt
Disney Co. empire in Florida, and ``News is a Verb'' by Pete
Hamill, a retrospective on
</P>
<P>
   his controversial and lengthy journalism career.

UNDERSTANDING THE SPIRIT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander F. Kleiner 3d &UR;  &LR; is an entrepreneur through and through.
Last month, before fulfilling his dream of starting a company, he
earned an MBA &UR;  &LR; from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Sloan School of Management. The following Monday, he founded
Frictionless Commerce Inc., an Internet shopping startup, with
three MIT Media Lab engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner, 30, credits a set of Sloan courses in ``New Venture and
Product Development,'' which trains students in the basic skills of
entrepreneurship, with helping him get Frictionless Commerce off
the ground. But he says it never would have been possible had he
not been passionate about his business idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to start my own company,'' says Kleiner,
the company's president. But taking classes helped turn that
passion into a reality. ``It's certainly easy to guide people who
have some predisposition'' toward entrepreneurship, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner and other young company founders with MBAs shed new
light on the longstanding question of whether entrepreneurship can
be taught. &UR;  &LR; Critics of entrepreneurial studies programs argue that
entrepreneurship is an instinct or talent _ involving passion,
creativity, and drive _ that cannot be taught. Academicians at
Sloan, Harvard Business School, and Babson College, which have
entrepreneurship programs for MBA students, counter that a
masters-level curriculum that teaches specific business skills is
critical for success in the fiercely competitive startup market. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the young entrepreneurs themselves say both the talent and
the toolbox are needed: Instinctive entrepreneurial drive and
classroom-taught business skills can both be essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can teach somebody to be an entrepreneur,''
says Deborah E. Frieze, a 28-year-old partner at the Boston-based
Internet consulting startup Zefer Corp. ``You just have to have an
incredible amount of passion, spirit, and drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Frieze, who received her MBA from Harvard Business School last
month, came to entrepreneurship by an unusual path. A longtime
skiing and boating enthusiast, the Newton, Mass. native graduated
from Amherst College and promptly headed to Colorado to be a ski
instructor, or ``ski bum for a year,'' as she puts it. While editor
of the ski magazine Snow Country, Frieze realized that she wanted
to work on both the business and news sides of publishing.
</P>
<P>
   A family history of entrepreneurship is among the key indicators
of entrepreneurial traits in business people, according to MIT
Entrepreneurship Center director Kenneth P. Morse. Frieze fits this
profile: her father started his own business.
</P>
<P>
   But it was at Harvard Business School that Frieze discovered a
long-dormant strain of entrepreneurship within herself. She
accepted a founding position with Zefer, where she runs the
company's content development for its Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Business school, Frieze says, taught her the nuts and bolts of
running a company, but it couldn't teach her to love the
entrepreneurial life. Her business partner agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parts that can be taught are the parts that are common to
every business, such as the fundamentals of strategy and the
fundamentals of finance,'' says Anthony K. Tjan, Zefer's chief
executive officer and a Harvard Business classmate of Frieze. An
entrepreneurial spirit since childhood, Tjan, 28, credits Harvard
Business School with teaching him the skills he needed to run his
business.
</P>
<P>
   He and some friends entered and won the school's annual business
plan competition with their plan for Zefer, and he says his
professors acted as ``true advisers,'' helping him understand the
intricacies of a venture financing deal he secured with
Toronto-based Mosaic Venture Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Zefer, which is renovating office space on South Street in
Boston, has 12 fulltime employees and receives 10 to 15 resumes a
week from job-seekers. The firm has signed up two major clients and
projects revenue of ``several hundred thousand dollars this
quarter,'' Tjan says.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, would-be entrepreneurs, lured by stories like
Zefer's, have turned to business schools to teach them the
practicalities of starting a business. Of the 900 students in the
Harvard Business School Class of 1998, 90 percent took one elective
class in entrepreneurship; 25 percent took three classes. And 22
percent of the Class of 1997 took jobs with small companies,
according to the school. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At Babson, a school known for its entrepreneurial studies, 30
percent of 1,600 undergraduates major in entrepreneurship, making
it the most popular major. And about 340 MBA students at the
Wellesley school enter the annual second-year business plan
competition, says entrepreneurship professor Julian E. Lange,
contest's faculty adviser.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sloan MBA students also favor entrepreneurship; New Product
and Venture Development was the second most popular track for MBAs
in the 1997-98 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   In entrepreneurship classes, students learn how to run a startup
from conception to initial public offering, taking classes such as
Sloan's ``Entrepreneurial Marketing,'' ``Starting and Running a
High Tech Company,'' and ``The Nuts and Bolts of Business Plans.''
They also network with other students, often forming partnerships
which can blossom into businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I've been developing this concept with are great,''
says Kleiner, of his partners. ``We've had dinner every week since
October.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over entrepreneurship education, professors say
they're tired of defending an educational field &UR;  &LR; which has
spawned &UR;  &LR; multiple successful companies.
</P>
<P>
   Morse, himself the founder of six companies, scoffs at the idea
that entrepreneurship is purely innate. ``That's like saying
someone has to be born a fighter pilot,'' he says. ``Would you put
somebody in a $16 million plane and say, `You look like Tom Cruise,
why don't you fly this plane?''' he notes, referring to the movie
``Top Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   But academics and students agree the fundamental drive which
impels every entrepreneur cannot be taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walk into the class saying, `Teach me to be an
entrepreneur,' you're not going to get it,'' says Babson MBA
Michael A. Healey, 33, who founded PCBuild Upgrade Centers Inc., a
hardware servicing firm in Needham which will have $5 million in
sales this fiscal year. ``If you say, `I want to be an
entrepreneur, what am I missing?' you'll do better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was Yon Lee and Wilson Lee, David Lee and Yolanda
Lee, Steven Lee and Dan Lee. There were short Lees and tall Lees,
boisterous and demure Lees, jittery Lees and self-assured Lees.
</P>
<P>
   Big enough to fill a banquet hall, the Lee family descended on
Boston's Chinatown this week for a reunion of roughly 350 members
from across the United States, Canada, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Though they do not all share a bloodline, they share the most
common surname in the world and a familial spirit that has linked
Lees _ in formal associations _ for 122 years.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 100 million Lees worldwide _ including 100,000
in the United States and 5,000 in Greater Boston _ it's quite a
family. The Lees are so numerous they own seven credit union
branches with $22 million in assets and buy buildings that serve as
cultural centers and meeting places in various cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Lees are not immediate relatives,'' said Yon Lee, the
English secretary of the Lee Family Association of New England.
``We follow the Confucius philosophy _ under the family tree, all
people of the same surname, at one time or another, came from the
same forefathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lees say they descended from the ancient philosopher Lao
Tzu, the founder of Taoism, who lived about 2,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The family reunion _ also called a convention, bringing together
``delegates'' from various cities _ is primarily social, but also
includes elections and meetings on fund-raising and launching more
credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever shares the last name of Lee can come _ besides Robert
E. Lee's descendants,'' jokes Steven Lee of San Francisco, the
group's grand national president.
</P>
<P>
   With only 10 delegates, compared to San Francisco's 40, Boston
won the rare opportunity to host this year's convention _ the last
of the millennium, since they're held every three years. Dynasty
restaurant owner Wilson Lee, who heads the New England chapter and
hopes to win election as grand national president at the
convention, excitedly bustled through the banquet, ushering people
to their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the back of a San Francisco store by two Lee brothers
in 1866, the Lee Family Association has sprouted 18 chapters since
then. The Lees have banded together for financial and moral support
and even to generate political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here for 150 years and we're still second-class
citizens,'' said Steven Lee. ``The only way the Chinese can get
more into the mainstream is to get more into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Their best-known relative is Bill Lann Lee, the assistant
attorney general for civil rights who was appointed by President
Clinton late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial assistance is one of the benefits of membership. ``It
helped me when I purchased a restaurant. I went there to borrow
money,'' said Steven Lee.
</P>
<P>
   But the association is best known as a friendly connection in an
unfamiliar place. What began as a support group providing food,
shelter and medical treatment for immigrant laborers facing
hostility and hardship has evolved into a networking group for
immigrant or non-immigrant Lees moving to new locales.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lee, who met his cousin through the association, said his
nephew needed a hand when he came to Harvard University. Steven
Lee's son was at Harvard Medical School and, a few phone calls
later, the sons were linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, a lot of people go to city government for help,''
said Al Lee, who noted the family association provides more
personal aid. ``All you need is to say the name of your village and
they'll know someone from the area.''

POSTAL SERVICE WON'T DISPATCH WILD TURKEY TO NEW HOME

 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Neither rain nor snow ... nor a wild turkey will
keep the postman away.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the bird that has been attacking mail trucks and preventing
postal deliveries on a leafy residential street here will not be
dispatched to a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Under an arrangement worked about between the residents of
Loughlin Street and the U.S. Postal Service, homeowners agreed to
move their mailboxes to the curbside.
</P>
<P>
   This will allow the letter carrier to deliver mail without
having to get out of the mail truck and risking a turkey attack,
said Mary Madonna, spokeswoman for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that the turkey will get accustomed to the new
system, and that will be the end of it,'' Madonna said.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey, which lives in the woods around Loughlin Street,
began periodically assaulting the mail truck last winter, neighbors
said. Frightened that he would hurt the bird, the postman stopped
delivering mail. Residents had to pick up their letters at the post
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service offered to have the bird trapped, but
residents refused, saying they had grown to like it.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement is fine with turkey-loving residents, said
James Palmer, 76, of 5 Loughlin St.
</P>
<P>
   But the bird has kept a low profile recently. Loughlin Street
residents say they have received their mail without incident for
the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hollister, former wildlife biologist with the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation, said the bird might have
perceived the red, white and blue mail truck as a competitor. But
now that the mating season has ended, so has the bird's aggressive
behavior, he theorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birds have a tendency to get more belligerent during the
mating season,'' Hollister said. ``They start in early March and
continue until June or as long as there are receptive hens
around.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sometime early on the morning of April 15, 1912, a white
porcelain teacup trimmed with 22-carat gold followed the Titanic to
the ocean floor. It settled, right-side up, on a crushed,
building-sized boiler that had been stoked by laborers, joining for
eternity symbols of the rich and the working class in a union too
deep for tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed when the cup was photographed by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, which located the wreck in 1985 and,
honoring its sanctity, took away only pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 2 1/2-mile-deep wreck has been visited 132
times, 96 of them under the auspices of George Tulloch, a
Connecticut entrepreneur whose exhibit, ``Titanic _ The Artifact
Exhibition,'' opened July 1 in a tent opposite the World Trade
Center in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Tulloch and associates have corralled about 5,000 items from the
wreck. Critics, including a Titanic historian, call Tulloch a grave
robber who has cheapened the Titanic by disturbing it for profit.
Admirers call him a hero who has guaranteed the artifacts will be
around for centuries, silently screaming of the thoughtlessness
that led to humankind's most spectacular maritime folly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, today, someone were to break off a piece of Plymouth Rock,
would the Museum of Fine Arts rush to display it?'' asked Don
Lynch, a Titanic historian and author who is vice president of the
Springfield-based Titanic Historical Society. ``What a shame that
Eastern Massachusetts, which has figured so prominently in our
nation's history, has so little regard for it by displaying these
artifacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Titanic historian takes the opposing camp's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been unethical not to salvage these artifacts,
and to have allowed the acidic sands to continue destroying them,''
said Charles Haas, a New Jersey teacher who has written three books
about the Titanic. ``Wait too long, and the pieces will be
destroyed. Tell me: Just when does history begin? When is it proper
to collect the evidence of a major human event?''
</P>
<P>
   The teacup, dramatically photographed by Dr. Robert D. Ballard
in ``The Discovery of the Titanic,'' is not in the exhibit. In
fact, its whereabouts today are in dispute. Critics suspect it was
knocked from its deep sea perch by all the robots plying the wreck
for the past nine years. To them, its disappearance represents
everything that is wrong with excavating a ship for profit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Paul Louden Brown, a Titanic Historical Society officer who
lives in Kent, England, has accused Tulloch of ``looting it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For 80 years, it nestled undisturbed, testament to an event
that caught ordinary people in an extraordinary moment of time,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Tulloch adamantly denies touching the cup, saying it remains
where it has always been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I care about? Making this exhibit so tasteful,
so devastatingly emotional that no one ever, ever ignores the kind
of warnings Captain (Edward J.) Smith ignored when he speeded into
that iceberg field,'' said Tulloch, who is 53.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: It is not smooth sailing through the ethical
reefs of a disaster that killed more than 1,500 people at a site
where the US Coast Guard continues to drop a commemorative wreath
annually. Is ``Titanic _ The Artifact Exhibition,'' a legend to
life or an insult to the dead? When the exhibit opened in London in
1994, it was the first time artifacts from the sunken ship had ever
been displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriateness of the display is an issue for James
Delgado, a maritime archeologist who has written extensively on the
pitfalls of salvaging shipwrecks for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most important is that the audience ask the question,'' said
Delgado, executive director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum.
``This exhibit may end up teaching you most about yourself.'' He
praised the careful conservation and archeological standards
maintained by Tulloch's crews.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston show (9 a.m.-6 p.m. Sun.-Thurs, 9 a.m.-8 p.m.
Fri.-Sat.) will be the fifth for an exhibit that has traveled
through London, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, Fla., and Memphis. The
show has been popular enough to force an extension of exhibition
hours and dates in those cities, curators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston show features 500 artifacts, including sheet music,
the ship's telegraph (the device that linked the bridge to the
engine room), and personal effects such as a man's suit and china,
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   A string of victories in Admiralty Court has granted Tulloch's
RMS Titanic Inc. exclusive salvaging rights to the wreck. He
essentially has vowed not to sell artifacts, and envisions storing
the collection, to which he adds annually, in its own museum
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I die it will be together,'' Tulloch said of the
collection during a break in exhibition construction the other day.
</P>
<P>
   But as remnants of the Titanic literally surface _ Tulloch hopes
to bring the bow up this summer _ vestiges of the disaster's
aftermath, captured in photographs such as the teacup, disappear
below. And this, said Louden Brown, cheapens the Titanic story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ship is still within the memory of the five living
survivors,'' he said. ``Shall I go collect and display artifacts
from the TWA 800 disaster or the Challenger explosion? Would this
be right? Who would pay, other than the ghouls?''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``There's nothing historically relevant in the
Titanic exhibit. We see a smoking pipe. So what have we learned?
That Edwardians smoked?''
</P>
<P>
   To such criticism, Tulloch cites such memorials as the Holocaust
Museum in Washington, which charges admission to illustrate with
actual artifacts the horror and bravery of humans in distress. No
human remains have been confirmed in the Titanic wreckage;
salvagers surmise the dead drifted away from the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, the schoolteacher, said an artifact does not have to be
unique to be historically important. For example, he said he
recently viewed in the exhibit a pair of eyeglasses, nail clippers,
a paperback book with a turned-down page, and pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   ``By themselves, they didn't mean much. But consider that they
were in the possession of Abe Lincoln when he was shot,'' Haas
said. ``That's how artifacts teach us about an event, and about
ourselves.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Dead Kennedys, their images, their spirits, are
everywhere in this grand Georgian house that Jean Kennedy Smith has
called home for five years. They don't haunt the place as much as
inform it with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That purpose is served now, and so Jean Kennedy Smith, the
longest-serving American ambassador to Ireland, is going home.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, she stood on these very grounds, in the
massive expanse they call the Phoenix Park, the shy sister of the
most powerful man in the world. She was standing here when John F.
Kennedy promised to return in the springtime. She was standing next
to her brother Jack when he looked around and wistfully suggested
he would like to live here as ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   But because of Dallas there couldn't be Dublin. It was left to
his little sister to return in the spring of 1993, to live in this
house as ambassador, to see through the unfinished business of
Ireland, which has always been, to one degree or another, the
unfinished business of the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 70-year-old Jean Kennedy Smith will end one of the
most improbable, controversial, and ultimately successful
diplomatic careers in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sleepy outpost for sleepy men, the US Embassy in
Ballsbridge, an ugly, circular granite building that looks like a
block of cheese, became a nerve center for White House foreign
policy on her watch. Britain's role as America's staunchest ally
became less important to a White House occupied by the first
president in a half-century whose world view was not shaped by
World War II. Under Bill Clinton, Washington abandoned its
hands-off policy in Northern Ireland, injecting itself into the
conflict, and treating Dublin's view of the problem as equally
valid as London's. Clinton's precedent-breaking foreign policy was
enthusiastically encouraged by his ambassador in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomatic neophyte and a politician only by osmosis, Jean
Kennedy Smith eschewed protocol and went with her gut, pushing for
things that career diplomats considered too controversial _ among
them a visa for Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political wing, so he could enter the United
States in 1994 while the IRA was still killing people. Her disdain
for protocol rubbed many traditionalists the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan, the filmmaker who is among the eclectic mix at her
frequent dinner parties, gave her a cameo appearance in his film
``Michael Collins.'' Some at the State Department rolled their
eyes, thinking such a stunt was beneath the dignity of a sitting
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   When the Irish president, Mary McAleese, was getting flak for
breaking Catholic canon law by taking communion in an Anglican
church to promote ecumenism, Kennedy Smith showed some sisterly
solidarity by going out and doing the same. Again, the
traditionalists at Foggy Bottom shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith treated dissent from her staff as disloyalty. She
punished two career diplomats who questioned her judgment on the
Adams visa, a break with protocol for which she was reprimanded by
the State Department. Raymond Seitz, the former US ambassador to
Britain recently used his memoirs to slam her as shallow, naive,
and ``an ardent IRA apologist.''
</P>
<P>
   What may bother her critics most is that Jean Kennedy Smith got
results. She has left bruised egos and toes in her wake. But she
has played a prominent role in one of Bill Clinton's few foreign
policy success stories. She will leave her post having seen the
Northern Ireland political settlement overwhelmingly approved by
people throughout the island.
</P>
<P>
   As democratic politics gradually phase out terrorism in Ireland,
she has earned a mention in the history books for her own actions,
not those of her brothers. For someone who lived most of her life
in the shadow of powerful men, she has stepped out into the light
and, critics be damned, got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her library, the soft light of a soft Irish day
filtering across a face that looks at this angle so much like her
brother Bobby, dead these 30 years, Jean Kennedy Smith folds her
arms across her chest. She is sliding her pumps on and off, smiling
that Cheshire cat smile, when asked about a tenure marked by both
diplomatic controversy and diplomatic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I was very fortunate to be in the position to do
something positive, to make a contribution to change. It gave me
terrific satisfaction,'' she says. ``It wasn't any hardship for
me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
From the Kennedy mold
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hardship, however, is no stranger to Jean Kennedy. Despite
having grown up rich and privileged, there was always a hint of
melancholy about her. Being on the bottom rung of a big, important
family can be a lonely place. She and Teddy were the youngest of
nine kids, she four years older than he.
</P>
<P>
   She has not had an easy life. Three of her four brothers died
young and violently. Her husband, Stephen Smith, who died in 1990,
was part of the Kennedy machine and was often on the road. She
raised four children. One of her daughters, Kym, married a Dublin
bartender a few years ago in what was a Dublin society event. The
marriage didn't last. One of her sons, William, was acquitted of
rape in a highly publicized 1991 trial that was hardly a
vindication of Kennedy family get-togethers.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, there was a dogged determination about her,
an ability to ride out stormy waters. In that respect, she is often
compared to her sister-in-law, Ethel. It was Jean who fixed Bobby
up with Ethel, Jean who introduced Jackie to Jack, and Joan to Ted.
More than an aunt to most of her nieces and nephews, Jean is
literally the matchmaker who ensured their births.
</P>
<P>
   At her dinner parties, however, she breaks couples up, refusing
to seat them next to each other, or even at the same table.
Instead, she invites people of different backgrounds and political
persuasions then deliberately sits them next to or near each other.
She prides herself on prodding those with different viewpoints to
share and defend them.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent soiree, Liz Mansergh and Patricia Walsh sat across
from each other, debating the merits of the settlement in Northern
Ireland. Mansergh, whose husband, Martin, is the Irish government's
top Northern Ireland strategist, was understandably optimistic.
Walsh, a clinical psychologist, was more cynical, viewing the North
as a hopelessly violent and bigoted place.
</P>
<P>
   Both women, however, agreed on one thing: They love Jean Kennedy
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has an extraordinary talent for getting people of
different backgrounds together and getting them to talk,'' said
Mansergh.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is an unabashed fan because of the Very Special Arts
program for the mentally disabled, which Kennedy Smith founded. It
is now in 55 countries, including Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps telling that women are among Kennedy Smith's
staunchest admirers, and men among her most vituperative critics.
</P>
<P>
   Seitz, US ambassador to Britain from 1991 to 1994, says she got
the job because it ``had always been a plaything for American
presidents who wanted to score a point or two with the
Irish-American electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, ``Over Here,'' Seitz was less than diplomatic:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean Kennedy Smith, who distrusted her own staff and penalized
them for their dissent, became a promotion agent for Adams. Too
shallow to understand the past and too naive to anticipate the
future, she was an ardent IRA apologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Washington's ambassador to the Court of St. James
has been the most influential in the White House. But Seitz
increasingly found his counsel on Northern Ireland, a situation he
called ``an issue without a resolution,'' being ignored. Clinton,
who wanted to help break the cycle of violence and reap the
political benefits, was more receptive to his Dublin ambassador,
who told him that he could help change the political dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Seitz's influence was eclipsed by a woman who as an
11-year-old lived at 14 Prince's Gate, the palatial US ambassador's
house in London that Seitz so adores, by the daughter of one of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Seitz accused Kennedy Smith of ``clientitis,'' a serious offense
in diplomatic service marked by identifying more with the interests
of the country where you are stationed than the one for which you
work.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Seitz is an unabashed Anglophile who now lives in
England, many wrote his criticism off as sour grapes. Some friends
suggest Kennedy Smith was stung by his attack. But she professes
more bewilderment than hurt.

 DUBLIN: ... than hurt.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But ``it didn't faze me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles when asked if she is hard to work for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I think I'm fairly demanding, probably. You have
to feel that when you're appointed to a job you have to do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses for a moment, then adds, ``The reprimand part was
unfortunate.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A natural politician
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are jealous of her, full stop,'' said Mary O'Rourke, the
Irish Cabinet minister for trade. ``Jean came here without a
reputation in politics, but she practiced the art of politics
better than her male predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Adams is partial to her. The former IRA leader turned
politician has brought the Irish republican movement into the
political mainstream. He credits Kennedy Smith with assisting in
that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes in dialogue, in creating the conditions that lead
to dialogue,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith says her ``open house'' policy was simply
following White House policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said the United States will help those who
take risks for peace, and I agree wholeheartedly with that
philosophy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She took risks herself. She backed the Adams visa long before
Clinton did. Attorney General Janet Reno and then Secretary of
State Warren Christopher were toeing the British line, that Adams
was an unreconstructed terrorist, that he needed to denounce
terrorism and distance himself from the IRA. Kennedy Smith accepted
that for Adams to do so would be political, if not literal,
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith's friends, among them the author Tim Pat Coogan
and the New York publisher Niall O'Dowd, who were both privy to
Sinn Fein strategy, told her that the IRA was considering a
cease-fire. But the IRA did not trust the British government, and
wanted the American government to broker the peace process. John
Hume, the leader of moderate nationalism in Northern Ireland, and
Albert Reynolds, then the Irish prime minister, told her they
thought letting Adams into the United States could dramatically
change the political climate and set in motion events that could
lead to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to prove that politics worked, worked better than
violence and produced better results,'' said Reynolds. ``Getting a
visa for Gerry Adams against all the opposition from London would
show the republican leadership and nationalists that politics and
the democratic system does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Kennedy said his sister convinced him to back the visa for
Adams, and to lobby Clinton for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to my big sister,'' Kennedy explained, only
half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton let Adams in, the resulting howls from the British
Establishment convinced the IRA that it was a bigger deal than it
really was.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith went even further in August 1994, when the IRA's
cease-fire was being held up because Sinn Fein wanted Joe Cahill,
the 78-year-old former IRA chief of staff, to brief American
supporters. Cahill had been convicted of killing a policeman in
1942, and the White House would have to intervene to let him into
the United States. Compounding the problem was the timing. Both
Washington and Dublin are virtually shut down during the last week
of August.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith was on vacation in France when she learned about
the holdup. She tracked down Nancy Soderberg, then the National
Security Council director, who was on vacation in Madrid. A few
days later, she found Soderberg again, this time in Los Angeles,
and repeated her appeal. Sensing that Soderberg was unconvinced,
Kennedy Smith called Reynolds on a boat in the Mediterranean and
asked him to call Soderberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 25 percent Irish. Tell her to use it,'' Kennedy Smith
told him.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Smith didn't leave anything to chance. She disturbed one
more vacation, calling President Clinton on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill got in and the cease-fire was declared 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when Soderberg gets an unexpected phone call in a
strange place, she half-thinks it's Jean Kennedy Smith. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bonds of bereavement
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While such diplomatic persistence impressed many, it did little
to change the perception among Protestants in Northern Ireland that
the Kennedys in general, and Jean Kennedy Smith in particular, are
blatantly pro-nationalist. Still, the leaders of loyalist groups,
which in the past killed Catholics in an attempt to weaken support
for the IRA, are among those who regularly attended Kennedy Smith's
soirees.
</P>
<P>
   Among her fans is Billy Hutchinson, a leader of the Progressive
Unionist Party, the political wing of the Ulster Volunteer Force,
for which he served 15 years in prison for killing two Catholics.
Hutchinson said his party sees her as a nationalist, but admires
her for treating them with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the IRA and the main loyalist paramilitary groups
called their cease-fires in 1994, it has been the representatives
of the extremists who have been most willing to compromise. It is
their people, after all, who do the bulk of the killing, dying, and
prison time. In Kennedy Smith, they found someone who understood
both the weight of suffering and the promise of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over the Dublin Mountains in the distance, Jean
Kennedy Smith acknowledges that the assassinations of her brothers
have had a profound effect on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I went to Belfast for a reception. We
saw in the news that a woman's husband had been shot. I said I
wanted to stop by and see her. So we did. We just took a long walk,
the woman and I, and she told me the story of how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the men who killed her husband ran out of the house, her
two children ran out after them, screaming, `You bastards!' She was
so afraid that they'd shoot her kids, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extemely brave, and I was very moved. She opened up to
me, because I think she saw me as someone who's been through it. I
think she felt that we had some bond there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to see how people came to their positions.
It's understandable, there was so much violence. I experienced that
in my own family. I think they appreciated the fact that I could
understand it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
An Irish heritage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The extended family is living here vicariously. Even those long
dead are everywhere, in photographs and paintings. Rose's photo is
on a radiator. Bobby and Jack are framed together on a side table.
Joseph Kennedy Sr. and three of his four sons, Jack, Bobby, and
Ted, are engraved into a decanter that rests, empty, on another
table.
</P>
<P>
   There is an oil portrait of Joe Sr. in the main foyer. A
portrait of Jack, looking pensive, stares across at his father, his
mother's portrait just beneath him. There is a Jamie Wyeth of the
ambassador hanging in one of the reception rooms. In the hush of an
afternoon, all of these Kennedy eyes are unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are Irish, the Kennedys are obsessed with history
and anniversaries. Kennedy Smith took up her Dublin post 30 years
to the day that she arrived in Ireland with her brother, Jack. She
carried with her a photograph of her standing with President
Clinton after he nominated her. Ted wrote on the back: ``For Jean,
who is going back in the springtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she returns to New York, she will end her official duties
Sunday as she began them, by going back to New Ross, in Wexford,
149 years after her great-grandfather Patrick Kennedy boarded a
ship there to escape the potato famine and begin a new life in
Boston. She will travel just a bit outside New Ross, to a place
called Dunganston, to the Kennedy homestead. She goes there, on
occasion, to smell the air, to wonder what would have happened if
her great-grandfather had not got on that boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-grandfather's youngest brother never left,'' she
says. ``And his great-grandson, Pat Kennedy, is a farmer in
Wexford. I visit him and we talk. We always have a chuckle about
what would have happened if his great-grandfather had gone over,
and how life would have been so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested Jean Kennedy Smith was driven by a desire to
complete some unfinished family business. She isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of the tide,'' she says, glancing at a photo of her
brother, the dead president. ``I really didn't think of it as a
Kennedy thing. I thought of it as a moment. A moment in history.''

`SMOKE SIGNALS' IS AN AMERICAN INDIE `EVENT' PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Native-American road picture, ``Smoke Signals,'' which
debuted locally as the ``mid-festival gala'' of the recent Seattle
International Film Festival and begins its regular run today, is
the closest thing we're likely to have this summer to an American
indie ``event'' picture.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it have a strong local connection (it's the first
offering of the Seattle-based ShadowCatcher Entertainment and
adapted from stories by Seattle author Sherman Alexie), it also won
both the Audience Award and Filmmaker's Trophy for best dramatic
film at the last Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   And it's laying claim to being the ``first full-length feature
film written, directed and co-produced by Native Americans,'' which
should guarantee it a high profile among critics, and a special
place (or at least an interesting footnote) in film history.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, all this hoopla and advance praise has turned out to be
more than just hype. The film is no earthshaker, but it's a funny,
charming, often poignant coming-of-age picture and all-around slice
of contemporary Indian life that just sparkles with authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Alexie's 1993 short story collection, ``The Lone Ranger
and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven,'' it's the story of two young Idaho
Indians: the athletic, charismatic and popular Victor Joseph (Adam
Beach) and his smaller, nerdy worshiper, Thomas Builds-the-Fire
(Evan Adams).
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a prologue set on the Fourth of July, 1988,
when a celebration at the Coeur d'Alene Indian reservation gets out
of hand, a fire breaks out, and a series of events ensue that
forces Arnold (Gary Farmer), father of the then-12-year-old Victor,
to desert his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 10 years later, and word reaches Victor and his mother
(Tantoo Cardinal) that Arnold has died in an Arizona trailer camp.
Victor feels obligated to bring back the ashes for burial, but,
with no money, the only way he can finance the trip is through his
ever-admiring pal Thomas, who insists on tagging along.
</P>
<P>
   From here, ``Smoke Signals'' segues into an enjoyable, if
familiar, mismatched-buddy road picture, with the two opposites
regularly attracting and repelling each another through a series of
picaresque experiences that leaves them, in the end, wiser and
better people.
</P>
<P>
   But it's extremely well done: cleverly scripted, almost
perfectly cast (Beach has the stuff of a major star), alternately
funny and touching, and thematically very effective, communicating
its serious message _ the plight of the American Indian _ with an
ingratiating, self-deprecating humor, rather than off-putting
anger.
</P>
<P>
   The only real flaw in the film is that the script has a certain
self-conscious tendency to relate every aspect of the characters'
lives to the ``Indian experience,'' which gradually gets tiresome
and often makes them come off less as living/breathing human beings
as literary devices designed to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals. Directed by Chris Eyre. Written by Sherman
Alexie. Cast: Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Tom Skerritt, Tantoo
Cardinal, Gary Farmer. Miramax. 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature
themes and language.

`CHERRY' IS AN IRANIAN VERSION OF ``IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abbas Kiarostami's ``Taste of Cherry,'' which won the
prestigious Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, might be
described as a fancy-free Iranian version of Frank Capra's ``It's a
Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Its hero is an apparently well-off, middle-aged man named Badii
(Homayoun Ershadi), who, for reasons he never expresses, has
decided to kill himself and is driving around the dusty,
mountainous outskirts of Teheran in his Range Rover looking for
someone to help him.
</P>
<P>
   He's already dug a shallow grave, and he believes he's mustered
the courage to lie down in it and do the deed that night. But he
wants someone to come back in the morning to cover him up, or, if
he somehow fails to pull off the task successfully, to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up a young Kurdish soldier in the Iranian Army, then an
Afghan seminary student, then an old Turkish taxidermist who
collects specimens for a natural history museum. The soldier flees
in terror when he explains what he wants, and the others are almost
as reluctant to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The trio give him a succession of reasons why suicide is not a
good idea. Everything from Hamlet's fear of the unknown to the
religious stigma of breaking God's will to your basic humanistic
bias against squandering the sweet gift of life _ giving up ``the
taste of cherries.''
</P>
<P>
   A cynical reviewer might argue Capra told this same story a lot
more effectively and that the Palme d'Or is often politically
inspired, so the award might have less to do with cinematic
brilliance in this case than with the director's courage in dealing
with the taboo subject of suicide in a country still ruled by
strict Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiarostami (``Through the Olive Trees'') definitely has his
own distinctive sensibility and world-view, which come across
nicely; his film has a kind of lyrical and poetic beauty at the
same time it's remarkably free of sentimentality and didacticism;
and it tells its tale with the minimalist effectiveness of a
first-rate short story.
</P>
<P>
   Taste of Cherry. Directed, written and edited by Abbas
Kiarostami. Cast: Homayoung Ershadi, Abdolhossein Bagheri, Afshin
Bakhtiari, Ali Moradi. Zeitgeist Films. 95 minutes. In Farsi with
English subtitles. Unrated.

GINGRICH TOUTS ALAMO AS SYMBOL OF FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich satisfied an old
historical itch Wednesday with a private tour of the Alamo as he
continued crisscrossing the nation, gauging reaction to a possible
presidential bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican also attended a GOP fund-raising event
before going to Dallas to address the national convention of the
League of United Latin American Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The former history professor described his first visit to the
storied Alamo, a Franciscan mission that became a symbol of Texas
independence, as remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about freedom,'' Gingrich beamed after emerging
from a 40-minute guided tour before the historic site opened to the
public. ``Just as freedom was the issue at the Alamo, it is an
issue around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 55, said he was impressed by the number of Texans of
Hispanic descent who died during the famed battle of 1836 against
the forces of Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the Hispanic-friendly theme, Gingrich said his speech
to the Hispanic convention would involve an inclusive theme aimed
at attracting more minorities to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe every American of every background deserves a
better education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich told reporters that Texas Gov. George W. Bush was a
``serious, honorable man'' who is ``definitely a contender'' for
the 2000 presidential nomination, if he chooses to run.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a Republican and son of the former president, is expected
to easily win re-election this year in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On his own presidential aspirations, Gingrich said he would not
make a decision until Labor Day 1999.

SENATE UNLIKELY TO APPROVE PROCESS FOR PUERTO RICAN STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release over the July 4 weekend)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican leaders have this good news for
Michael Liberman: You won't have to toss out your inventory of
50-star flags any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman, president of Valley Forge Flag Company, Inc., in
Womelsdorf, Pa., the nation's largest retail flag maker, has been
fretting that moves in Congress to make Puerto Rico the 51st state
would leave him with a huge inventory of outdated Old Glorys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lobby for statehood from a flag manufacturing point of
view,'' said Liberman. ``It's no picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the House voted in March for a plan for Puerto Rico to
hold a plebiscite on whether its 3.9 million residents wanted to
become a state or be totally independent or retain their present
commonwealth status, the measure appears dead in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Puerto Rico already are U.S. citizens and serve
in the U.S. military. They have a local government like most states
and get most federal services, like the U.S. Postal Office, but get
a smaller share of programs for the needy like Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike residents of the 50 states, Puerto Ricans aren't
represented by voting members of Congress and they can't vote for
president. They also don't pay federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Puerto Ricans voted on their future political
status, in 1993, they showed themselves ambivalent: 48 percent
favored the current commonwealth status, 46 percent wanted
statehood and 4 percent preferred total independence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Puerto Ricans think Congress should act this
year because 1998 marks the 100th anniversary of the U.S.
annexation of Puerto Rico as part of the spoils from the
Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   If a congressionally approved plebiscite were held anytime soon,
polls in Puerto Rico indicate the statehood option would likely get
the most votes. If a majority opted for statehood, the House-passed
bill would give Congress 10 years to decide whether to grant
statehood to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The issue's apparent death in the Senate stems from two factors.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the ``cultural'' opponents of Puerto Rican
statehood led by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the assistant majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles says he doesn't believe Puerto Rico should become a
state because ``there are very significant cultural differences,
language, traditions and culture'' between Puerto Rico and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who supports the plebiscite plan, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use their culture to bar them from voting rights or
responsibilities in our country, if they so choose to seek them by
majority vote, is wrong,'' Clinton said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles also says he has ``strong reservations'' about the House
bill because it ``really seems tilted toward statehood.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, he adds, it's ``not going to be on the (Senate's)
calendar this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The second factor is that no one knows whether Democrats or
Republicans would occupy all or most of the two new Senate seats
and six new House seats that Puerto Rican statehood would bring to
Congress. Given this uncertainty, senators are reluctant to change
the political status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry E. Craig, R-Idaho, No. 4 in the Senate Republican
leadership and a supporter of a plebiscite in Puerto Rico, says the
uncertainty is one reason the issue won't come up in the Senate
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be Democrat or Republican?'' Craig said. ``Nobody
knows. Who can predict the politics of Puerto Rico 10 years down
the road?''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of Puerto Rico's local senators and
representatives are Republicans and their legislature recently
approved such Republican agenda items as school tuition vouchers,
school prayer and income and capital gains tax cuts. On the other
hand, with the average wage in Puerto Rico at about $11,000 a year,
there's speculation that traditional Democratic programs might
appeal to many voters there.
</P>
<P>
   Others predict that the political party that Puerto Ricans
perceive as championing statehood could expect to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   Craig cites Alaska and Hawaii, which joined the union in 1959
and 1960 respectively, as examples of political unpredictability.
While many senators thought Alaska would be a Democratic state and
Hawaii would be Republican, the opposite has generally been the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance on the part of lawmakers is easy to understand,
Craig said. ``It's very simple, you count numbers.'' Puerto Rico,
with nearly 3.9 million residents, would be larger than 24 states,
which means it would have more House members than nearly half the
states.
</P>
<P>
   At least some Republicans think a GOP push for Puerto Rican
statehood would help erase any lingering anti-Hispanic blemish on
the party stemming from California Gov. Pete Wilson's energetic
campaigns against bilingual education, illegal immigration, state
benefits to illegal immigrants and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Romeu, the Washington lobbyist for Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro
Rossello, warned that words coming from the Senate about cultural
differences between Puerto Ricans and the rest of the United States
smack of racism and will not play well in the territory and among
American Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican party can ill afford such anti-Hispanic
sentiment,'' Romeu said. ``It is a time bomb for Republicans
because if they fail to act, it will look like racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Pollster Frank Luntz advised House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who pushed for the House bill, that pressing for
Puerto Rican self-determination would be a good way to appeal to
Hispanic voters around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the razor-thin vote in the House in March, 209 to 208, was
too close to sweep the issue onto the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., a co-sponsor with Craig of the bill in
the Senate, said the centennial of Puerto Rico's acquisition by the
United States ``would be an ideal time'' for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   However, Graham said Congress should not put statehood up as an
option if the lawmakers are not prepared to grant it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing we could do is set up a plebiscite and then
not respect their choice,'' Graham said. ``That would go to the
core of issues of dignity and respect that are so critical to U.S.
relations in the Western hemisphere. If people feel this is a
beauty contest and it doesn't carry any consequences, then they
should vote no.''

GOP SEN. JOHN ASHCROFT AIMS FOR PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For weekend release)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Staunch conservative Sen. John Ashcroft is battling
to break out of political obscurity and become the Republican
Party's new version of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan, Ashcroft, 56, is a former governor. And although he
lacks Reagan's Hollywood credentials, Ashcroft is a baritone with
the ``Singing Senators'' (which includes Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott), writes his own gospel tunes and has performed on stage
with country music stars including Ray Stevens and the Oak Ridge
Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential election is two years off, but Ashcroft,
Missouri's first-term junior senator, is already elbowing his way
into a crowded field of GOP 2000 possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, seen as a moderate conservative, is
the early darling of the party establishment. Publishing magnate
Steve Forbes, commentator Patrick Buchanan and former Vice
President Dan Quayle all loom large as Ashcroft competitors for
support among the party's hard-core conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that is stopping the senator from trying to be the
nominee who bridges the gap between the party's often-contentious
hardline conservative wings _ social conservatives, who favor
school prayer and oppose legal abortion, and fiscal conservatives,
who want major tax cuts and minimal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever leads the Republican Party in 2000 (has to) motivate
both of those streams,'' Ashcroft said at a recent lunch with
reporters. ``If you can't, I don't think you'll win. But if you
have both energized, you'll succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Ashcroft has succeeded in winning support from Paul
Weyrich, a leading conservative thinker who is president of the
Washington-based Free Congress Foundation. In an interview Weyrich
called Ashcroft ``non-threatening'' and said that by contrast,
``one reason brother Pat (Buchanan) couldn't get elected (in 1992
and 1996) was that, stylistically, he was threatening.'' Ashcroft,
with much the same message as Buchanan, ``is somebody who is
attractive and saleable,'' Weyrich added.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, a former law professor at Southwest Missouri State
University, has a long record of public service back home. He was
state auditor and state attorney general as well as a two-term
governor before winning his U.S. Senate seat in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to prove his bridge-building credentials, he cites his
record in balancing eight budgets in a row. On his watch, Missouri
adopted a restrictive abortion law that the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld in a landmark 1989 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's aides trumpet his current role in ratcheting up the
tax cut in the Senate Republicans' proposed 1999 budget. It had
been pegged at $30 billion, but last month GOP Senate leaders,
under pressure from Ashcroft and others, doubled it.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is a champion of killing the so-called marriage
penalty, which requires many married couples to pay higher taxes
together than if each were single. The issue, Ashcroft insists,
appeals to conservatives of every stripe within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   His political consultant, Keith Appell, calls Ashcroft ``the
best man to reunite the economic and social conservatives, which is
the Reagan formula for victory. That's why he's viewed as the most
electable conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft also has sharply criticized President Clinton on the
Monica Lewinsky matter, calling Clinton ``a president who views a
vulnerable woman from the perspective of a predator.'' At the same
time, he has criticized fellow Republicans for failing to go on the
offensive over allegations that Clinton had a sexual relationship
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   An evangelical Christian, Ashcroft leads his office staff in
prayer each morning. The senator, who has the demeanor of a
thank-you-ma'am Boy Scout, wins praise from the Christian Coalition
and popular Christian broadcaster James C. Dobson for his
opposition to the National Endowment for the Arts and his efforts
to win federal funding for religiously oriented organizations that
run homeless shelters and drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Ashcroft has turned the heads of a lot of social
conservatives in this country,'' says Randy Tate, a former House
member from Washington state and executive director of the
Christian Coalition, which does not endorse candidates. ``He has a
message that resonates with the grassroots.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ashcroft is running uphill. His name recognition is
nowhere near that of his chief conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And if he were to win the nomination, ``he's not the kind of
candidate who could move back to the center, where most voters
are,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution. ``It would give the Democrat a great advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar view was expressed by Mark Miller, executive director
of the Republican Leadership Council, which seeks to offset the
grip of social conservatives on the party. ``Republicans who focus
on narrow litmus-test issues have lost in the past and are going to
keep losing,'' Miller said. ``We want the party to focus on issues
that unite all Republicans.'' But he added that ``if Ashcroft does
that, I think he'll find some success.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ashcroft's political action committee, Spirit of America, has $1
million in the bank and is likely to take in another million by the
end of the year, says its director, Jack Oliver. Since declaring
his interest in seeking the nomination last August, Ashcroft has
visited such key states as Iowa six times, including a visit this
weekend, and New Hampshire twice.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he will make up his mind about running in October
or November. He figures he would have to raise $20 million to mount
an effective campaign. His attractiveness to big conservative
contributors hovers as a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have good ideas,'' said Tate of the
Christian Coalition. ``But if no one hears you, it doesn't do any
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the GOP faithful are beginning to take notice. In March,
Ashcroft placed fifth with 9 percent in a straw poll of Republican
leaders in Biloxi, Miss. Bush was first with 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a CBS News poll of Republican voters in April, Ashcroft
received only 2 percent. Bush had 25 percent. But in May, Ashcroft
was No. 1 in a poll of Republican activists in South Carolina,
taking 32 percent of the vote to Bush's 15 percent.

   SHARP-COLUMN-COX (Atlanta) _ One of the greatest challenges
facing any automaker today is bringing the right product to market.
Few would argue that Mercedes-Benz is doing an exceptional job: the
E-Class, sporty SLK and M-Class sport-utility vehicle are all
blessed with exceptional customer demand. Just how does a carmaker
make the right decision at the right time? Many rely on research
groups, previous sales data and managerial skills. By Linda Sharp.

Of course, there'll always be buyers for two-door, regular-cab

boomers who have made it as the second or even third car in their

GERMAN WILL IS SYMBOL OF ITS SOCCER PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: A version of this feature was sent and held yesterday.
Please use this version.) 
 (JT)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Of all the World Cup quarterfinalists, the Germans have
looked, at times, the most inept. Indeed, at home, they have been
compared to the Russian space station MIR, staggering from mishap
to mishap but somehow staying aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Clumsy, strangely disorganized, the team has often looked like a
group of aging has-beens. Coach Berti Vogts has experimented with
so many players in midfield _ even dropping what looked like the
best of them, the 25-year-old Jens Jeremies _ that attempts to
discern his strategy have seemed futile.
</P>
<P>
   But soccer's supreme competition is much more than a test of
skill, as England's epic struggle with Argentina showed. When, as
now, the final rounds loom, the game moves beyond the control and
distribution of a ball to the realm of psychological confrontation.
Nations unwittingly bear their souls in what amounts to
life-and-death struggles for victory.
</P>
<P>
   This is an area in which the German team _ known simply at home
as the ``Mannschaft'' (The Team) _ has excelled, regularly coming
from behind, often in the last minutes, to reach a remarkable six
finals and nine semifinals in thirteen World Cup appearances. It
has won the trophy three times, a record surpassed only by Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the classic image of the German team comes from the 1982
World Cup semifinal against France. With his team trailing 3-1 to
France and minutes left to play, the great striker Karl-Heinz
Rummenigge came on as substitute and immediately removed his shin
guards.
</P>
<P>
   By disdainfully hurling away his protection, Rummenigge was
declaring that the real battle, unsoftened and unfettered, had
begun. France, with perhaps its greatest team ever, and one clearly
more skilled than the German, shuddered. Germany surged back to 3-3
and won the game on a penalty shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has his own conception of tactics,'' Jurgen
Klinsmann, the German captain, said here this week. ``For
ourselves, we try to concentrate on our power. That is to say, we
try to build the pressure, increase the pressure, until the
adversary finally cracks and is overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ability counts, but so, too, does the sheer
strength of character and self-belief that alone can keep tide
after tide of attacks coming and turn near-certain defeat into
victory. It is this quality of the Germans that strikes fear into
opponents who, on paper, have superior players.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsmann, who has played more than 100 times for Germany, was
speaking after Germany had reached the quarterfinals here by
beating Mexico 2-1. It was a textbook German victory against a team
that often seemed more skilled. Two goals in the last 15 minutes,
by Klinsmann and fellow striker Oliver Bierhoff, literally
shattered the Mexicans, who had seemed headed for a surprise 1-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the tournament, Germany trailed Yugoslavia 2-0 with
20 minutes left and came back to tie the game 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to its first World Cup victory in 1954 in
Switzerland, Germany was thrashed 8-3 in an opening game against
Hungary but nonetheless qualified for the knockout rounds. In the
final, it faced Hungary again. Within minutes the Hungarians took a
2-0 lead and the match seemed over. But the Germans came back to
win, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans are in the final eight yet again, playing Croatia on
Saturday. It seems, more than ever, that sheer force of character
has brought them this far. For this, by any estimate, is not a
great squad. Indeed, its midfield has often resembled nothing so
much as a great and gloomy void.
</P>
<P>
   What then keeps the ``Mannschaft'' going here, urged onward by
the 34-year-old Klinsmann and the 37-year-old sweeper Lothar
Matthaus? Where does this exceptional will to win find its roots?
</P>
<P>
   The expression of national pride has, of course, been a
difficult issue for Germans ever since World War II. In the soccer
team the nation clearly finds a uniquely powerful symbol for values
of strength, determination and cohesion that cannot readily be
displayed elsewhere. While every country takes pride in its soccer
team, not every country takes pride in the team's moral fiber and
will power above all else.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many players over 30, and so many evident problems
in the team, a fourth triumph still looks like a long shot, despite
the fine performances of striker Oliver Bierhoff, the best header
of the ball in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the team's repeated last-minute comebacks here,
left-back Christian Ziege said this week, ``It is time we won a
game safely, otherwise our fans will die of heart attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, however, the heart attacks have generally been
suffered by Germany's opponents. France, which will meet Germany in
the semifinal if the teams win against Italy and Croatia
respectively, still bears the scars of that 1982 game which seemed
to many French commentators to reflect an old French inferiority
complex with respect to its powerful neighbor. France has never won
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As the French sports columnist Roland Gransart commented
laconically this week of the German side, ``Defeat? Never heard of
it.''

 &HT;    (ANALYSIS: CLINTON'S VISIT BRINGS NEW OPENNESS IN CHINA, BUT FOR
HOW LONG?
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ For the first time, Chinese from village leaders to
Communist Party Central Committee staff talked openly this week to
Americans about what has been a taboo topic _ taking direct
elections beyond the very lowest grass roots level in China.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's new thinking or just new talking about thoughts
that have lain hidden in Chinese minds for years, Robert Pastor, a
foreign policy expert with the Carter Center in Atlanta, believes
the change his delegation of elections consultants saw this week
was a rapid response to President Clinton's trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Clinton visit will change America's relationships
with China in operative ways,'' said Pastor, whose delegation
happened to be visiting the country simultaneously with Clinton.
``We found that the visit seemed to break down some officials'
reluctance to talk about sensitive issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the change will last is altogether another question.
</P>
<P>
   What did the most to break down old ways was the unprecedented
joint news conference on June 27, when Clinton and China's
President Jiang Zemin aired their differing views about democracy
and individual rights on live television.
</P>
<P>
   Live, uncensored television coverage of that event and of
Clinton's major speech on Monday, which also dug into sensitive
human rights issues, was the most important victory the White House
attained on the nine-day China tour that was ending here Friday.
Appearances on a later Shanghai radio call-in show and a television
interview added two mini-achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But these were victories that came at a price to the Clinton
administration. They also were victories whose repercussions could
continue rippling down a positive course or could catch in an
undertow disastrous for the administration's goals of engendering
democracy and freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, a key feature of that polite but tense
confrontation between Jiang and Clinton was its ending. The two
leaders stepped out of the ring smiling.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that President Jiang held a well-publicized,
friendly dinner to say goodbye to the Clintons the next day
reinforced the message that debate at least on some levels can be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   It was followed by the surprising openness found by Carter
Center consultants who have been wandering around the countryside
for two years trying to help village elections proceed like they do
in a seasoned democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Their experience was probably more than just a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists sampling the Chinese reaction have met the same
phenomenon as the Carter Center team _ a shy opening that is far
from universal yet still noticeable among average Chinese. This
week, many Chinese who were queried on streets, in the train
station or at the infamous Tiananmen Square were willing to talk
about democracy and individual rights. The number was much greater
than in early June around the ninth anniversary of the crushing of
the Tiananmen Square democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where it leads or what it amounts to or what additional things
might happen as a result of that type of opening is something
that's not entirely clear to us,'' White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said late this week. ``Maybe it's not even clear to the
Chinese authorities themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the administration gives this an optimistic spin.
``We hope it signals some reconsideration of the degree to which
this has been a very closed political culture,'' McCurry said.
``Having made a conscious decision to be that open, it sometimes
becomes hard to reverse decisions like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, over the past quarter century the Chinese have
found it quite easy to reverse such decisions, despite the high
cost. Just ask the students who mounted the Tiananmen Square
protests that lasted for weeks before the government decided to act
against them. Ask the families of the hundreds who were killed by
government troops.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen if tens of thousands of Chinese start demanding
those freedoms Clinton said they deserve?
</P>
<P>
   McCurry noted that Jiang Zemin and the leaders who permitted the
live telecast of Clinton's sometimes hard words made a decision
``fraught with great risk.''
</P>
<P>
   So far there has been no manifestation of high level, internal
party dissent over that decision, which led to millions of Chinese
people viewing Clinton's exceptional public criticism of China's
policies. None of the politburo's seven standing committee members
boycotted the state dinner for Clinton held just hours after the
remarkable joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But party dissension isn't normally evident until it is acted
upon through the removal of officials or change of policies or
order to send out tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand,'' McCurry went on, ``that it's incumbent on us
to maximize the reward for doing the right thing and minimize the
opportunities for those who would try to exploit what some might
call 'weakness' on the part of the Chinese leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he added that administration officials ``obviously want to
try to help the good guys as much as we can'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   And giving that ``reward'' to ``the good guys'' was the price of
airing American views.
</P>
<P>
   The first cost was paid when Clinton received the formal state
welcome outside the Great Hall of the People on the western edge of
Tiananmen Square. Participating in the ceremony there, with
saluting canon positioned on the square at the same place the
students' tents met tank treads, will be rightly viewed by many
pro-democracy activists here and abroad as closing the books on the
Chinese regime's 1989 violent crackdown on nonviolent protest.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Clinton has already paid with his reputation _
mainly among idealists who refuse to accept realpoliticking as the
basis for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The second price was Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement Clinton seemed to toss off during a roundtable
discussion in Shanghai on Tuesday, he offered up to the Chinese
leadership the single most valuable gift he could have given.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first U.S. president to utter the ``three no's''
policy _ no support for Taiwan's independence, no support of a
``two China'' policy or a ``one China, one Taiwan'' policy, and no
support for Taiwanese membership in international organizations
whose members are sovereign countries. This was the message the top
Chinese leadership said they wanted to hear from Clinton in the
days leading up to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   To Western ears the ``three no's'' don't sound like much,
considering that other leading U.S. officials including the
secretary of state have repeated that the formula is American
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it means something vital to Taiwanese, especially those
increasingly popular opposition figures in the Democratic
Progressive Party who do support independence and feel their
adherence to democractic principles earns them the right to form
their own nation. They will run in legislative elections at the end
of the year, which will be followed in the year 2000 by
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   With the President himself for the first time ever enunciating
the ``three no's,'' it is a clear statement that those
pro-independence forces will not get U.S. support, even if they win
overwhelming support of their own people at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton statement looked a lot like a trade-off with the
Chinese leadership, the quid the U.S. gave for the Chinese quo of
granting Clinton unfettered access to the air waves and thus to the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Chinese finally granted him his second live
access to a mass television audience, reporters noted a curious
last-minute switch in the composition of the Chinese members of a
roundtable discussion. An Internet entrepreneur who had arrived at
the Shanghai Library with an invitation to participate in the
roundtable was replaced inexplicably with a Chinese expert on
U.S.-Chinese relations. Clinton's ``three no's'' came in response
to a comment from that added-starter panelist.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the ``rewards'' Clinton gave the Chinese were intangible
_ accepting a welcoming ceremony on Tiananmen Square and
eliminating the wiggle room in American policy on Taiwan. They're
only symbols, but they carry great importance to China's leaders,
to underground Chinese dissidents and to the Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
   They were symbols traded for a potential _ the potential of more
openness and greater democracy in China _ that may or may not be
realized.

THE DIFFERENCE IS DONATIONS, NOT DISTRIBUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The solution is more organ donation, not wider distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the rules to require nationwide allocation of organs
and tissues for transplant surgery won't save more lives, but
working together as communities to increase organ donation will.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
says that ``accidents of geography'' explain why certain cities
have less waiting time.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, these cities have shorter waiting times because
the level of organ donation is higher, and the high levels of
donation are no accident.
</P>
<P>
   LifeGift, the Fort Worth-based organization that oversees the
donation and recovery of organs and tissues for transplant centers
throughout North Texas, increased organ donation by 51 percent in
the 108 counties it serves during the past five years, more than
twice the national rate of increase.
</P>
<P>
   Too few organs are available for all the lifesaving transplant
surgery needed in the Fort Worth area, or anywhere else. Increasing
donation is the only way to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed changes would punish communities such as ours that are
doing a good job of increasing organ donation, and would reward
communities that are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   In May, LifeGift recovered more organs for donation than any
other organ-procurement organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
   LifeGift does a great job of inspiring this community to donate
organs and tissues. The group works with doctors, nurses,
chaplains, families, community organizations and the media to
increase our commitment to organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   LifeGift and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) are
spearheading efforts to keep the current regional organ allocation
system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while the Senate was debating a new regulation to
revise the nation's organ-transplantation system, members of Texans
for Transplants were meeting outside Cook Children's Medical
Center, rallying public support for rejecting the new plan,
scheduled for adoption in October.
</P>
<P>
   UNOS, the national organization responsible for organ
allocation, was meeting in Fort Worth to emphasize the need to keep
the current system, which requires all patients listed for
transplant to meet certain requirements, no matter where the
surgery is to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Status 1 patients _ those on life-support systems with a week or
less to live without transplant surgery _ have highest priority
nationwide. What changes in the allocations system would do, UNOS
says, is decrease the waiting time for Status 2 and 3 patients at
centers with long waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   That all translates into a substantial increase in transplant
volume at large centers and reduced transplant volume in small to
midsize centers, where procurement organizations such as LifeGift
have done an extraordinary job of recruiting donors.
</P>
<P>
   It would help the large centers grow larger and increase their
success rate, because they could give more transplants to less-sick
patients, but ultimately it won't save more lives. The only thing
that will do that is more donations.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians were debating the issue in Washington, UNOS
members from across the country were clarifying their stand in Fort
Worth: The current system best meets the goals of utility, equity
and justice.

 (JT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On television or in the grandstand, the World Cup
appears stridently nationalistic. When the English chant during the
Argentine national anthem and the Argentines whistle during ``God
Save the Queen,'' it sounds like the guns of August of 1914 all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the field, it is another story, and thank goodness for
that. As the World Cup shifts into the quarterfinals Friday, with
France meeting Italy in St. Denis, and Brazil meeting Denmark in
Nantes, it is helpful to remember that these players are members of
the same latter-day guild, free to cross borders in search of the
almighty lira, pound, franc, peseta, Deutschmark and yen.
</P>
<P>
   When they kick each other and take anguished dives over some
poltergeistian foul, they are not doing it for the fatherland or
motherland, but rather because that is how they normally go about
their business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these guys are even friends. Last Saturday night, after
Ronaldo's Brazil defeated Ivan Zamorano's Chile, they embraced and
disappeared down the tunnel together, perhaps to exchange shirts
with identical No. 9 on them.
</P>
<P>
   This was not some instant friendship sprung from 90 minutes of
soccer. These two men from Latin America spend most of the year in
Milan, where they both play up front for Inter.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 22 French players have worked in Italy, and they
graciously praise that country for their soccer education.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Italy, every Sunday is a championship and every Wednesday
is a European cup,'' said Zinadine Zidane of France, who plays for
Juventus of Turin, the New York Yankees of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the French players who played outside the country have
brought something back with them,'' Zidane said. ``Myself, I
learned to win with Juventus. Today I have only one wish: To win
with the national team of France.''
</P>
<P>
   Another French player who works in Italy is Youri Djorkaeff, the
artistic shotmaker for Inter. Friday, he is sure to run into
Giuseppe Bergomi, the quiet Zio Beppe (Uncle Joey) of Inter, who
has been pressed into duty as the Italian sweeper because of
injuries. Then there is Gianluca Pagliuca, the winner of the Dean
Martin Lookalike Contest, who minds the goal for Inter and
currently for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good pal, but on Friday he will become my enemy for 90
minutes,'' Pagliuca told the French sports daily, L'Equipe.
</P>
<P>
   Pagliuca swung an ugly elbow at an opponent during the first
round, while Djorkaeff and all attackers know how to deliver nasty
little kicks to the head and body of a goalkeeper sprawling for the
ball, but there are limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't insult Gianluca that way I insulted Chilavert before
the Paraguay game,'' Djorkaeff said, referring to the burly goalie,
Jose-Luis Chilavert. ``That time, I wanted to create a spirit of
revolt, to provoke him.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Djorkaeff has been provoking Pagliuca on the long
pullman rides to the old Italian city-states during the grueling
Serie A season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to light up Gianluca, gently,'' Djorkaeff said. ``I've
played against Italy twice and scored twice, both when he was the
keeper. He tells me I was lucky both times.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other players in this World Cup have labored in Spain or
England. When Real Madrid won the Champions Cup in May, Predrag
Mijatovic of Yugoslavia scored the winning goal and later came off
for Davor Suker, who plays for Croatia. The history of their two
nations is full of grief, but Mijatovic and Suker are family
friends. Yugoslavia has been eliminated, and Sukor made the penalty
kick to beat Romania the other day.
</P>
<P>
   When Argentina plays the Netherlands in Marseille on Saturday,
Javier Zanetti of Argentina may cross paths with Aron Winter, the
savvy Dutch midfielder, his teammate from Inter. When towering
Peter Schmeichel, the Danish goalkeeper, wields his body as a
weapon against Brazil on Friday, he already knows many of them from
European games with Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Desailly of France recently completed five seasons with
AC Milan, where he meshed in the defensive formation with three
starters for Italy, Paolo Maldini, Billy Costacurta and Demetrio
Albertini.
</P>
<P>
   There is a history to this cross-pollenization. Michel Platini,
the co-president of the French organizing committee for this World
Cup, had six superb seasons playing for Juventus. Despite his
family's roots in the Piedmont section of Italy, Platini did not
speak Italian when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played cards, we ate together, we visited each others'
homes,'' Platini said this week. ``If my socks didn't match my
shirt, Claudio Gentile or Marco Tardelli would get on me about
it.'' In 1986, Platini scored a goal for France in a 2-0
quarterfinal victory over Italy in the World Cup in Mexico. A few
weeks later, he and his Italian pals were replaying the game during
Juventus road trips to Naples or Florence. If only the fans could
bounce back so easily.

STRESSED-OUT WORKERS, MANAGERS ARE OFFERED GOOD SUGGESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty million Americans stay at their jobs only to retain
health benefits. Yet research studies indicate that their work has
a good chance of making them sick.
</P>
<P>
   That is an interesting observation discussed in ``Toxic Work:
How to Overcome Stress, Overload, and Burnout and Revitalize Your
Career'' (The Penguin Group, 245 pages, $12.95, paperback).
</P>
<P>
   The book is one of several paperbacks now out discussing the
horrendous problem of stress in the work place.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Loving your job is not an option, but an absolute
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect more pressure, greater demands, and fewer people
employed on-site to do the work,'' writes ``Toxic Work'' author
Barbara Bailey Reinhold. ``That's why loving what you do has never
been more important _ if your work doesn't excite you, the
accelerated expectations will be unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Workplace stress is the single greatest health problem of
working adults, according to the president of the American
Institute of Stress.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks are most common on Monday mornings between 8-9
a.m., a statistic that led to the coining of the term ``Black
Monday Syndrome,'' Reinhold writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The syndrome of toxic work overtakes you when what's happening
to you at work causes protracted bouts of distress, culminating in
emotional suffering or physical symptoms and heightened by the
perceived inability to stop the pain and move on to find or create
a more rewarding situation,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Body signals from stress at the workplace that can lead to
greater health complications include fatigue, dizziness, headaches,
nausea, allergies, back pain, digestive tract problems and
recurrent colds, flu or infections.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the problems Reinhold has observed in her
clients over the past 25 years as a counselor and teacher of career
planning. Reinhold is also the director of career development and
an adjunct professor of psychology at Smith College.
</P>
<P>
   Using numerous vignettes and studies to support her case of
stressful work and health complications, Reinhold helps readers
evaluate their own work situation through a quiz and discussion of
body signals.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find a connection between the two, Reinhold
provides a detox section, in which she offers numerous suggestions
to relieve the stress. Changing jobs is just one of the options.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you cannot control some events ..., you can control how
you react to those events,'' she writes. ``Two major things make
the difference: how you interpret what's happening at work, and
whether you are able to see life's upheavals and dissatisfactions
as catalysts rather than catastrophes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another book in paperback offers good suggestions for managers
in charge of all those stressed-out workers.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``The Bad Attitude Survival Guide: Essential Tools
for Managers'' (Addison Wesley, 278 pages, $15) by management
consultant Harry E. Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many management books that outline a Utopian work
environment supported by numerous case studies of companies that
are doing things right, this book deals more directly with the
down-and-dirty realities of most workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers suggests that there is an epidemic of bad attitudes in
the American workplace, primarily the result of poor managers, who
are not properly trained to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot change someone else's attitude,'' he writes.
``Trying to change bad attitudes is a fruitless pursuit. Focus on
behavior _ it is something you can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers uses case studies of individuals to illustrate common
workplace situations. He then offers numerous approaches that a
manager can take to effectively turn around that individual's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The book is full of useful observations on how to handle real
work world scenarios.

DANISH GOALKEEPER CONSIDERED THE BEST IN THE WORLD ... AND THE
LOUDEST 
</HEADLINE>

 (JT)  
 By JERE LONGMAN

<P>
   PARIS _ As he stood in goal for Denmark's 4-1 dismantling of
Nigeria, Peter Schmeichel grabbed his head with his hands and
twisted it from side to side as if he were unscrewing a bottle cap.
Then he repeatedly flexed his jaws, limbering the muscles of his
mouth the way others stretch their hamstrings. He is considered the
best goalkeeper in the world, and also the loudest.
</P>
<P>
   He screams and yells at teammate and opponent alike, blistering
them with the same histrionic torrent that John McEnroe and Jimmy
Connors leveled at tennis umpires. The son of a classically-trained
musician, he is a boisterous conductor on the field, using his
mouth as a baton.
</P>
<P>
   He sees everyone in front of him, knowing where they are, or
should be, and he feels it is his job to direct the rhythm of a
game. In keeping the ball out of the net, he believes he must be as
selfish as a striker trying to send it into the net. And he has
even been known to grab fans who have invaded the pitch and edgily
toss them out of his workspace.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Schmeichel's steadfastness, tiny Denmark has grown
accustomed to high achievement in the face of low expectations. Few
are expecting the Danes to defeat Brazil in the World Cup
quarterfinals on Friday in Nantes, but with the 6-foot-4 Schmeichel
hulking in goal, Coach Bo Johansson feels that Denmark will at
least begin the game with the equivalent of a goal advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we have a great victory it is often just because
Peter Schmeichel is so good,'' Johansson said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that no one is dismissing Denmark has much to do with
the 1992 European championships. That summer, its players were on
the beach, celebrating a short break between seasons, when they
were summoned to replace Yugoslavia, which had been banned because
of sanctions relating to the Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the late replacements acquit themselves well,
Denmark became the champions of all of Europe. In the semifinals,
Schmeichel saved a penalty kick against Holland's Marco Van Basten,
who was the world's best scorer at the time. In the final,
Schmeichel turned the momentum in Denmark's favor with a
spectacular save on a shot by Germany's Juergen Klinsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he will have to contend with Brazil and Ronaldo, the
latest gunslinger challenging for a shootout. Brazil returned to
bogo jonito, the beautiful game, with a 4-1 second-round swamping
of Chile as Ronaldo delivered two goals. But the Danes, playing in
only their second World Cup, have nothing to lose, so they approach
Brazil with great equanimity. There are only five million people in
all of Denmark, while there appears to be at least that many in the
frenzied Brazilian press corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fantastic for a small country like Denmark,''
Schmeichel said. ``We have a lot of confidence. If we lose, okay,
people expect that, but if we win, then it will be the sensation of
the century.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 34 now, and came to full-time professional soccer at the
relatively late age of 24. As a semi-pro, he supplemented his
soccer income with various jobs that today's millionaires might
find insulting. Schmeichel served as an apprentice carpet, fitter,
he sold advertising for a newspaper, he worked as a cleaner and he
ran a charity shop for the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Schmeichel was signed by powerful Manchester United of
the English Premier League. The price paid for him was the
now-miserly sum of 750,000 pounds (slightly more than $1 million),
considering that Schmeichel has now bolstered the team to four
league championships. His style in goal is to stand up tall, cut
down the angles, and force the attacker to make the first move.
That way, Schmeichel insists, the opposing striker is left to do
the thinking, and perhaps, the self-doubting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his entire aura, this big, blonde Viking flying out at
you,'' Alex Ferguson, Manchester United's manager, once said of
Schmeichel. ``It cuts an attacker's options down 10 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Unafraid to join in attack, Schmeichel once headed in a goal for
Manchester United during a European cup match. Some consider him to
be reckless, though, in his wandering, and opponents try to make
him pay by lifting long chip shots over his head. His screaming has
gotten him into trouble, also. Twice he has been accused of making
racial remarks at Ian Wright, a black striker, during matches
between Manchester United and Arsenal. He has denied making the
remarks, and no sanctions have been taken against him.
</P>
<P>
   Away from soccer, Schmeichel, a father of two, is quiet and
reflective. He plays the piano, everything from Billy Joel to
classical, and he keeps a studio in his home. A tune he composed
for the 1996 European championships, ``We Can Do It,'' did well on
the Danish charts. Friday, it will be his difficult job to prevent
the rhythm on the field from becoming strictly samba.

DESOLATE BUT BEAUTIFUL, SIERRA BLANCA IN LINE TO BECOME A NUCLEAR
DUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIERRA BLANCA, Texas _ In the fall of 1948, with his political
survival hanging by a thread, President Harry Truman nonetheless
found time for a campaign whistle-stop that would be worth a few
dozen votes at best.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Truman, at the time in a fierce re-election battle
with Thomas Dewey, had something other than the Electoral College
in mind when his campaign train pulled into this tiny southwest
Texas hamlet 90 miles east of El Paso. Maybe he stopped instead to
restore his spirits amid the rocky desert peaks of the Quitman
Mountains, and the blooming yucca, and the elk and deer and jack
rabbits, and the sun- and wind-burned people who somehow managed to
scratch sustenance from the dry earth.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving photographs of Truman's 10-minute visit to Sierra
Blanca show a beaming president exchanging a robust handshake with
a locally renowned rodeo cowboy named Charley Norton, who rode to
the presidential train on his horse, Snake. Truman briefly
addressed the gathered crowd that day, and his wistfulness was
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go see the rodeo than do what I have to do,'' he
said. ``But I have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that sentiment, one wonders what Truman might think about
developments in this desert enclave today. Just east of town, there
are plans for a massive underground facility to receive low-level
nuclear waste from other parts of Texas and two Northeastern
states. Already, every day since 1992, tons of New York City's
waste-water sludge have been dispersed across the desert just to
the west.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, at least, this seems an affront. On my own first
visit here a decade ago, the local sheriff, a leathery fellow named
Dick Love, took me in his pickup on a long tour of the back country
south of town. Against the blue backdrop of racing storm clouds,
great mountains blazed orange in the setting sun. We drove up a
craggy one-lane mountain road that ran precariously along a steep
cliff, and came to look down on the crude huts of a tiny Mexican
village just across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   It was a breathtaking moment, one I've often thought of in the
years since. I can appreciate Truman's wistfulness for a land that
seems taken from a border novel of Cormac McCarthy, a land so
reminiscent of the Big Bend or the Guadalupe Mountains, Texas
places now preserved and celebrated as national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed nuclear waste disposal site has long been a matter
of fierce debate. Whether it or the New York City sludge operation
pose threats to human health depends on whom you talk to. In fact,
they probably don't. But celebrations they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``IT'S BEEN AN OBSESSION'': The mountain called Sierra Blanca
looms on the horizon northwest of the village, humpbacked and
tan-colored in the desert sun, not white like its Spanish name
suggests. When Spanish explorers first encountered this chunk of
the Chihuahua Desert centuries ago, rainfall was more abundant and
the mountain was covered by white poppies. Or so explains a tall,
thin man named Billy Addington, who stands in the desert sun
outside the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Addington talks above the noise of successive semitrailers as
they lumber through town, waving at each passing pickup, for he has
lived in Sierra Blanca for almost all of his 42 years and knows
virtually every one of the 600 or so residents.
</P>
<P>
   The brown-brick family-owned store was built in 1929 by his
grandfather, Jose Guerra, a Lebanese immigrant who came first to
Mexico, then to Sierra Blanca in 1910. Guerra first sold his goods
from a small wagon hauled up and down the newly finished railroad
line. Eventually there was a Guerra store, a butane company, a
lumberyard and a 6,000-acre ranch in the foothills of the Eagle
Mountains near the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have been a multimillionaire,'' Addington says of his
ancestor. ``But he loved this town. He could have made a lot more
money in the city, but he loved this. He put his sweat and blood in
this town. What you see here he built ... and by God, I'm going to
defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   So last Nov. 1, Addington embarked on a 56-day hunger strike to
protest the nuclear dump site, ending his fast at, of all places,
the Terlingua Chili Cook-Off in nearby Big Bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an experience with a Porta Potti that I won't describe
to you,'' he says, smiling. ``You're supposed to eat rice and drink
broth when you go off one of those suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the conversation, Addington is deadly
earnest, his eyes welling up in tears while speaking of a long
battle against the dump that he says cost him his wife and young
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I see you more on TV than at home,''' Addington
says. ``She left in January of 1994. She said, `I love you, Billy,
and I'll always love you. But I want a life.' It's been an
obsession, a self-admitted obsession. I've got a lot of anger. A
little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Addington, the leader of the local opposition, scarcely surfaces
for air as he rants on. State and federal politicians have
conspired with huge utilities who need a cheaper place to dump
nuclear waste, he says. Each of the six other similar nuclear dump
sites built in the United States since the 1960s has leaked. This
is the state's most active area for earthquakes, further
heightening the risk of leakage, which could contaminate the ground
water. Because it is small and isolated, Sierra Blanca has no
political clout with which to defend itself.

NOT ALL SUMMER MOVIES ARE SILLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood has never issued an official declaration. But the
Fourth of July weekend is the peak of the silly season in movies.
As fireworks detonate around the country, thousands of screens will
light up with fantasies of the world (or part of the world) saved
at the last minute from destruction by the savvy and courage of
comic-book heroes going up against catastrophic forces.
</P>
<P>
   In a movie climate where giant mutant lizards (``Godzilla''),
earth-shattering comets (``Deep Impact'') and zooming asteroids
(``Armageddon'') call the apocalyptic shots, is there any room left
for real people with human-size problems?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some high-profile movies (``The Truman Show,'' ``Out of
Sight,'' ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' and, of course, the re-release
of ``Gone With the Wind'') aspire to be more than high-concept
blockbusters. But the place you're still mostly likely to find one
is your local art theater.
</P>
<P>
   This year there are plenty of worthy small films to choose from.
Here is a sampling, listed in the order of this critic's
preference.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``HENRY FOOL.'' In an astounding leap beyond the polished
whimsy of movies like ``Flirt,'' independent filmmaker Hal Hartley
has concocted a gripping all-American fable about art and
excrement, friendship and fame, genius and self-delusion, that
follows the rise of Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) from persecuted
milquetoasty garbage man to internationally acclaimed poet.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's raggedy mentor, Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), is an
equally unlikely literary type, an erudite borderline psychopath
who camps out in the basement of the New York home Simon shares
with his grotesquely dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing subtle about ``Henry Fool,'' which while cannily
avoiding quoting from Simon's epic poem, suggests that great
literature is necessarily shocking and offensive to the status quo.
Parker Posey is memorably abrasive as Simon's slatternly sister
who, in a fit of pique, douses him with boiling water. A caveat: If
you have no tolerance for raw, patently unrealistic allegory,
``Henry Fool'' is not for you.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``VOYAGE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.'' In his last major
film role, an obviously ailing Marcello Mastroianni plays an aged
movie director who is the alter ego of the octogenarian
Portuguese-French filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira. Touring rural
Portugal with three younger colleagues, the crotchety old director
revisits crumbling landmarks of his youth that stir up old
memories. Paying a surprise visit to the aged aunt of one of the
travelers, the group arrives in a village where time seems to have
stood still for the last two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The movie (much of which was filmed from the back of a moving
car in which the camera observes the landscape left behind) feels
like the director's long austerely poignant goodbye to filmmaking
and to life itself. Warning: There is no action, no suspense, no
real story. The film is essentially a personal meditation.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK.'' The success of Peter Weir's
``Truman Show'' has prompted the re-release of the director's eerie
unsolved mystery (made in 1975). Adapted from a novel by Joan
Lindsay, it is about some virginal Australian schoolgirls who
mysteriously disappear one afternoon while exploring an ominous
geological formation.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting the rigid formality and repression of boarding
school life in 1900 with the rugged outdoors teeming with life, the
film conveys a hallucinatory vision of two colliding worlds, one
artificially sanitized, the other fiercely predatory.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a more surreal and subtle ``Close Encounters of the
Third Kind'' as conceived by Sigmund Freud.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``THE SPANISH PRISONER.'' Almost as sleek as ``North by
Northwest,'' David Mamet's homage to Alfred Hitchcock by way of
Kafka finds Joe Ross (Campbell Scott), a loyal corporate employee
and inventor of something called ``the process,'' caught in a web
of chicanery fiendish enough to drive anyone to a raving paranoia.
The screenplay's self-consciously staccato ``Mametese'' deepens the
tension, as Joe, finding himself a murder suspect, attempts to flee
with the help of a resourceful secretary (Rebecca Pidgeon).
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin is especially intriguing as a twinkling-eyed bon
vivant named Jimmy Dell who pulls some powerful strings. More than
just a suspenseful romp, ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' is a moral fable
of integrity and greed that imagines the world as a game of poker
rigged against all suckers who are foolish enough to believe
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``THE OPPOSITE OF SEX.'' Some of the nastiest dialogue ever to
spice a Hollywood film spews from the mouth of Dedee (Christina
Ricci), the selfish teen-age vixen who narrates Don Roos' smart but
occasionally stumbling comedy of gay and straight (bad) manners.
Fleeing Louisiana to visit her gay older half brother, Bill (Martin
Donovan), in Indiana, Dedee seduces his handsome younger lover,
Matt (Ivan Sergei), and the pair elope to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the beginning of a sustained comic chase in which
Bill and his ex-lover's spinsterish sister, Lucia (Lisa Kudrow),
pursue the couple from West Hollywood to the Canadian woods, with
many complications (including an accidental homicide) along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I WENT DOWN.'' Paddy Breathnach's quirky underworld comedy
follows two comically mismatched Irish hoods, Git (Peter McDonald)
and Bunny (Brendan Gleeson), who are forced by their petty mobster
of a boss (Tony Doyle) to travel to Cork to bring back another man
who owes him money. The trip becomes a bumbling comedy of errors in
which the reluctant kidnappers establish an unlikely bond of
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   If the Irish dialect is sometimes too thick to be intelligible,
the movie unfolds like an absorbing, idiomatically pungent string
of anecdotes (announced by chapter titles) related from a bar stool
in a seedy Irish pub.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``HIGH ART.'' Ally Sheedy is mesmerizing as Lucy, a prickly
heroin-sniffing photographer whose downstairs neighbor, Syd (Radha
Mitchell), a low-level editor for a photography magazine, coaxes
her out of her self-destructive stupor to create a cover essay for
the publication. Patricia Clarkson is equally compelling as Lucy's
arrogant, seriously drug-addicted German lover.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Lisa Cholodenko, raises uncomfortable
questions about self-exploitation in the pursuit of art and career
success but is marred by a melodramatic ending that feels tossed
off and unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ ``BUFFALO '66.'' Wiry, wide-eyed and twitching in his
semi-autobiographical debut film, Vincent Gallo is Billy Brown, a
high-strung loser just sprung from prison where he spent five years
for a crime he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   Abducting a teen-ager named Layla (Christina Ricci) from her
dance class, he coerces her into pretending to be his adoring wife
when he visits his monstrous parents (Ben Gazzara and Anjelica
Huston) and tells them a phony story about how well he has been
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo '66'' has the raw spontaneity and abrasive texture of
a John Cassavetes film and a nerve-jangling central performance by
Gallo, who also directed, helped write the screenplay and composed
the music.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO.'' The Studio 54-like club to which
the endlessly loquacious yuppies in Whit Stillman's third film
periodically repair is only a backdrop for the philosophically
wistful conversations of its WASPy would-be smart set.
</P>
<P>
   If the conversation isn't as stimulating as the
upper-class-conscious prattle in Stillman's first and best film,
``Metropolitan,'' ``The Last Days of Disco'' has the same
distinctive style and mood. Kate Beckinsale is the group's arrogant
mean-spirited social director and Chloe Sevigny her persecuted
roommate and co-worker in a publishing house. Chris Eigeman, a
Stillman regular, offers an amusing analysis of Disney's ``Lady and
the Tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``MARIE BAIE DES ANGES.'' Vahina Giocante is a sullen,
sexually precocious teen-ager who stirs up the hormones of a group
of American sailors on the French Riviera near Nice.
</P>
<P>
   In this ominous meditation on the primal savagery of teen-age
sexual rites, the camera never stops moving as it observes an
assortment of wild youth diving and preying on one another in the
pearly waters of the ``Bay of Angels.'' Frederic Malgras is the
disaffected petty criminal who plays a brooding Romeo to Ms.
Giocante's Juliet. If this first feature film by Manuel Pradal has
trouble telling a story and keeping track of time, it still casts a
spell.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``THE LAND GIRLS.'' As a hundred World War II movies have
taught several generations of postwar filmgoers, the Americans and
British were never more high-minded and noble than when
collectively standing up against Nazism. David Leland's appealingly
rose-colored memory film recalls the contribution of the Women's
Land Army to the British war effort.
</P>
<P>
   A high-toned soap opera with a stiff upper lip, the movie
follows the lives of three young women (Catherine McCormack, Rachel
Weisz and Anna Friel) from divergent backgrounds who share cramped
quarters on the same Dorset farm and take turns having flings with
the owner's son.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``HAV PLENTY.'' Nodding gracefully to Woody Allen and Spike
Lee, Christopher Scott Cherot makes a promising feature film debut
with a sharply witty, lighter-than-air satire of buppie mating
rituals. Chertot directed, wrote the screenplay and stars as Lee
Plenty, a self-effacing down-on-his-luck writer who resists the
aggressive overtures of several women to remain loyal to his pal
and secret true love, Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell). An
arrogant materialistic beauty with a heavy attitude, Havilland must
discover for herself that money isn't everything. The movie is
marred by a weak, tacked-on ending.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``KURT AND COURTNEY.'' Did Courtney Love have Kurt Cobain
killed for his fortune? Nick Broomfield, an intrepid British
filmmaker infatuated with sleaze doesn't really believe she did.
But the what-if premise becomes an excuse for Broomfield, a pushy,
tabloid answer to David Frost, to stick his nose into some of the
grimier corners of the leftover Seattle grunge scene.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unpleasant characters interviewed, Ms. Love's father,
Hank Harrison, may be the most appalling. Years after Ms. Love has
fled the nest, he is still waging a bitter power struggle with his
absent daughter, whom he trashes with malicious glee.
</P>
<P>
   As Broomfield showed in ``Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam,'' he
has a talent for coaxing unsavory characters to come out from under
their rocks and spill the beans.

SIERRA BLANCA, Texas: to defend itself. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It grieves me deeply that for the love of money, they're
making us the nuclear and sewage sludge pay toilet of the United
States, and that's never going to stop,'' Addington says. ``That is
the future of Sierra Blanca if this happens _ national dump, a
graveyard for retired reactors, maybe even more sludge projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Addington probably fights a losing battle. On July 7, after
months of contentious hearings, a two-judge administrative panel in
Austin is expected to recommend that an operating license be
granted for the low-level waste site five miles east of Sierra
Blanca on Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   And the truth is, more Hudspeth County and Sierra Blanca
residents probably favor the site and the badly needed jobs and tax
dollars it brings than oppose it. As evidence, proponents routinely
point to Addington's campaign this spring for Hudspeth County
Democratic chairman, which he turned into a nuclear dump site
referendum. On April 14, Addington was defeated, 340 votes to 245,
by a retired Hudspeth County resident named Tom Neely, who took no
position on the dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the Nixon speech,'' area rancher James
Schilling says one day in the lobby of the Sierra Motel. ``Remember
the Silent Majority? The funny thing is, the only people you'll get
to talk about it are the ones opposed. I just don't see any
problems with it. It has to go somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the support are not hard to fathom in the
predominantly Hispanic village, where most residents have stronger
ancestral ties to towns like Chihuahua and Coyame in Mexico than
any place north. They scratch out livings on the ranches, or
working for the county or school district. Century-old adobe homes
are cracked and weather-beaten, most roads are unpaved, and most
schoolchildren meet federal poverty guidelines for free hot
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   But today, in the middle of town sits a new, oasislike park,
strikingly green and lush against the otherwise dusty desert
backdrop. The park, replete with shiny new playground equipment and
pristine tennis courts, was built in part with tax money already
received from the disposal site. There is a new local firetruck,
too, and plans to renovate the crumbling adobe courthouse. The
school district owns two new buses, a new floor in the high school
gym, new turf and lighting at the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have those types of projects without a new bond
issue, and we're taxed almost to the limit already,'' says Lewis
Rogers, the retiring superintendent of Sierra Blanca schools, with
an enrollment of 128 students in grades K-12. ``Those buses were
very much needed, and we're very thankful to get them. Now we can
send our kids out almost anywhere they need to go, and not worry
about getting them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Addington calls this economic blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to be isolated,'' he says. ``But that isolation has
been our greatest hurt now, because the reality is that there are
only 1,607 registered voters in the county, and 3 million acres, a
place the size of Connecticut. That's why they're putting it here.
That's why they keep coming back here. They just won't give up.
They've come in with that economic blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY LOVED PATTON: An uninterrupted night's sleep does not come
easy in Sierra Blanca. Every few hours, trains rumble loudly
through the middle of town, trains like the one that brought Truman
to town, Amtrak trains speeding west toward California or east to
San Antonio, freight trains, trains pulling red rail cars carrying
New York City sludge.
</P>
<P>
   They are ubiquitous reminders that without the railroad, there
probably would be no Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, 1869, they drove the golden spike at Promontory in
the Utah Territory, celebrating the completion of the nation's
first transcontinental railroad. ``But the need remained for a
southern route,'' reads the historical marker in Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   In 1869, Southern Pacific began building a line east from
California; two years later, the Texas and Pacific railroad built
westward from East Texas. The two lines neared each other in Sierra
Blanca, where railroad officials agreed the lines would ``approach,
meet and form one continuous line to the Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroad's strategic significance and the mounting border
menace of guerrilla Pancho Villa in the early 1900s led to the
deployment of U.S. Cavalry in Sierra Blanca, including a
30-year-old lieutenant named George Patton. One Patton biography
would later describe Sierra Blanca as ``a violent holdover from the
Old West, populated by cowboys and gunfighters of fearsome
reputation. ... The entire town consisted of approximately 50
people, 20 houses, a saloon and a hotel. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The whiskey flowed copiously in the saloon, and on any given
Saturday night the local pistoleros and cowhands entertained
themselves by firing weapons at targets both real and imagined,''
writes Patton biographer Carlo D'Este. ``Patton's profanity, his
ability to shoot a pistol and his free-spending ways at the saloon,
where he delighted in buying beer for them, quickly made him a
popular figure with the rough-hewn Texans, who sensed a kindred
spirit.''

   STUTTGART, Germany _ When John Cranko, the artistic director of
the Wurttemberg State Theater Ballet, took his company to New York
in 1969, he warned his dancers, ``Don't unpack your bags until
after the first-night reviews.'' But the critics raved and the
company returned to Germany triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   From then on it would be known as the Stuttgart Ballet, a named
bestowed by the dance critic Clive Barnes, and today ballet
companies everywhere aspire to its success.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Cranko died in 1973 _ only 45, he had a heart attack
on a plane returning from another New York tour _ he had created a
company that was to become a dynasty builder: former members now
direct troupes in Frankfurt, Vienna, Stuttgart, Hamburg and Leipzig
as well as at The Hague and Vancouver. Cranko, a South African,
danced and choreographed in London before taking over the
Wurttemberg in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   There, he developed a company with several dancers from the
Americas who stayed on to help shape the German ballet scene. These
include Reid Anderson, John Neumeier, Richard Cragun, William
Forsythe and Marcia Haydee, who was also Cranko's muse.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Tuesday, Lincoln Center Festival '98 pays tribute to
this influential choreographer and father figure when two members
of the 1969 tour, Anderson and Neumeier, return to New York as
directors of the Stuttgart and Hamburg troupes, respectively.
Performances by their companies span 36 years of choreography _
from Cranko's signature full-length works ``Romeo and Juliet'' and
``Onegin'' to Neumeier's two United States premieres, ``All Our
Yesteryears'' and ``Bernstein Dances,'' which begin on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which hasn't seen the Stuttgart for almost 20 years
and the Hamburg for 13, is an appropriate venue for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of New York in 1969 was so very important because
suddenly everybody in Stuttgart realized what they had in this
company, and they were able to change things,'' Anderson said in an
interview in April, sitting at his desk overlooking Stuttgart's
Schlossgarten. Dressed stylishly in a black-and-white-checked suit,
Anderson, a Canadian who studied dance in London and joined the
Stuttgart at 18, now doubles as artistic director and general
manager, or Intendant, of the 64-member troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, Stuttgart was the first company in Germany whose
corps went on pay parity with the corps in the opera,'' Anderson
said. Previously, the chorus had earned more than the corps de
ballet. ``We were the first company here to actually become a
ballet company, not an opera-ballet company,'' he added, referring
to dancers who must perform in opera as well as ballet productions.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stuttgart Ballet started courting him for the position,
Anderson told the search committee he had to have his own budget,
meaning control of $6.1 million. Germany's system of
government-subsidized culture takes care of many basic expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it works is I have a budget, but I don't have to pay
for the making of the sets,'' Anderson explained. ``I don't have to
pay for making costumes, to rent a theater, to pay for an
orchestra. I don't have to have a huge staff; I can avail myself of
the theater's staff. Those are all costs that North American
companies have to pay out of their budgets. Eighty percent of my
budget goes toward the cost of my dancers and my team here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson learned about budgets first-hand when he served as
artistic director of Ballet British Columbia in Vancouver, from
1987 to 1989, and then of the National Ballet of Canada in Toronto,
from 1989 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Stuttgart, when I first went to Vancouver, I
didn't even know what marketing and development was,'' he said.
``We raised $8 million for new works in seven years. I was
extremely happy in Toronto. In 1989 it was a go-getter city, it was
thriving. Everybody was in the black, everybody was doing lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Province of Ontario cut Anderson's budget by a
half-million dollars. ``It was like being eaten by piranha,'' he
said. At that point, he accepted Stuttgart's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Cranko's death, Ms. Haydee, a Brazilian, had
taken over as artistic director. When Anderson arrived in 1996, he
said he found much to be done: ``It was kind of calcified at the
top. I was the gray eminence who would float through the hallways.
I had to fire friends of mine. I had to say, `I'm sorry I don't
think so.' '' Anderson subsequently hired 21 new dancers.
</P>
<P>
   German opera houses offer a combination of artistic freedom and
financial security that produces working conditions much different
from those in North America. But when Stuttgart Ballet mounted a
two-week homage to John Cranko in October, Anderson said, the
extravaganza cost ``a whole pile of money I didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a regional bank backed the festival, becoming one of
a growing number of corporate sponsors of the arts in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Stuttgart Ballet's performances this week are classic Cranko,
Anderson said: ``I haven't had time to build up an arsenal of rep
to go to New York and say this is what we do now.'' ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' created in 1958, put Cranko on the map. (Ms. Haydee, who
danced Juliet in the Stuttgart version, plays Lady Capulet in the
current production.) Walter Erich Schaefer, Stuttgart's intendant
from 1945 to 1972, didn't know that much about ballet, Anderson
said, adding, ``But he knew what he had in John, especially after
the huge success of `Romeo and Juliet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson praises ``Onegin,'' first performed in New York in
1969, as a brilliant story ballet. ``John's credo,'' he said, ``was
you should be able to arrive as the lights go down and you should
be able to understand everything that's going on without reading a
program note.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranko's choreography uses a cinematic technique in which two
scenes are juxtaposed, one interacting against the other. Anderson
remembers the choreographer's saying: ``Wherever I look onstage, I
want to see a story. The audiences happen to be focusing on the
(italics)lead,(end italics) but I want to see what's happening to
the other people onstage as a reaction to the drama.''
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on a dramatic story line distinguishes many
European companies from those in the United States. Both the
Stuttgart's and the Hamburg's dancers excel at blending emotion and
technique, as the narrative choreography by Cranko and Neumeier
demands, influenced, perhaps, by their years in England.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Confessions of a June
father-of-the-bride
 &HT;    Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My youngest daughter was a June bride. I was a
June father-of-the-bride.
</P>
<P>
   This was my third and last stint as father of the bride. Through
it all, I have learned much, most of which came too late to do me
any good.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a father of daughters, maybe some of the following
will help you.
</P>
<P>
   A girl can't begin planning her wedding too soon. If she hasn't
picked out a wedding dress by age 3, she is behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Guys have little or no part to play in weddings. A cardboard
cutout could do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the wedding for the bride. The wedding is for the bride's
mother. The bride will have her wedding a generation later when it
comes time for her daughter to marry.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way in heaven's name you can prepare yourself for
what the flowers will cost. Ever wonder why fathers of the bride
cry at weddings?
</P>
<P>
   That's not to suggest that a wedding is about money. A wedding
is about love. A wedding is about how women love to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   Wedding cakes are priced by the slice. For what it cost, you'd
think it'd be the size of a slice of watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   There will be wedding cake left over. Eat to your heart's
content. Better that than eating your heart out thinking how much
it cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the top of the wedding cake is to be saved, frozen and then
eaten by the couple on their first anniversary. Not all fathers of
the bride know about that ritual. I didn't when my oldest daughter
married. By the time they told me, it was too late. Sorry about
that.
</P>
<P>
   When my second daughter married, I offered a cash option.
Anything less than what her older sister had spent, she could have
in cash. So it was that she ended up with both a nice wedding and a
nice nest egg. Better she than the florist.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is required of the father of the bride. Get a
haircut and show up. That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't make suggestions. Keep your mouth shut. Keep to yourself.
Best that you lock yourself in your room. Let them shove you the
bills under the door, and you shove them the checks.
</P>
<P>
   If you hold the reception at your home, make the proper
arrangements ahead of time at the bank. The blood bank, that is.
Before it's over, you're going to be bled dry.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need to have the house painted. You'll need new shutters.
(Wait until you find out what shutters cost. Shudder would be a
better spelling.)
</P>
<P>
   You may even need a new driveway, walkway and patio. Awnings are
a nice touch.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, we even added an extra outside staircase
from which the bride could toss her bouquet. I only wish I'd caught
the bouquet. Maybe I could have gotten a partial refund from the
florist.

SIERRA BLANCA, Texas: a kindred spirit.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eighty-three years after Patton's departure, the Sierra Blanca
train depot has been converted into a museum, and Hudspeth County
historian Julia Jenkins directs visitors to a small painting of the
nondescript wood-frame house Patton called home. On another wall is
the newspaper chronicling Truman's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who was born in Sierra Blanca more than 70 years ago,
says the site of Patton's home is now a vacant lot. She points out
the back door of the museum to the ranch land where the sludge
operation now exists, but tries to deflect questions about the
current nuclear controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of have to stay neutral,'' she says. ``It's supposed to
be harmless. That's my word, supposed. It's just because we're
poor, I guess. Poor and struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TRENCH AND THE ELK: Joe Castro grew up in Fort Hancock,
another small town only 35 miles west. In the dust of a windy, gray
afternoon, he points at and names each visible mountain. The Eagle
Mountains loom to the south. Devil's Back Ridge is over there.
Yucca Mesa. Sand Mountain. The Quitmans.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro's job today has more to do with what might soon be
below the ground than what is above it. He is a state employee,
field office supervisor at the desert site nominated to receive
low-level nuclear waste from Texas, Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and officials of the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Disposal Authority have convincing answers for most questions
raised by critics. In the last 20 years, they say, improved
technology has all but eliminated the chance of nuclear waste
escaping into the earth. Inside a brown double-wide trailer at the
proposed dump site, 28 thick volumes of research used in the
license application process fill a bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   Near the trailer's front door stands a 55-gallon barrel with the
top cut away to show the gloves, syringes, tools and other smaller
items irradiated by medical uses that will be disposed of at the
site. Outside are huge plastic containers that hold irradiated
water from nuclear power plants, water that will be transformed
into solids by a special resin before being buried here.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the property is a huge gash in the earth, 40
feet deep, hundreds of yards long. If the facility is licensed,
trucks will back into similar trenches and off-load the nuclear
waste into concrete canisters strong enough, Castro says, to
withstand a massive earthquake without leaking.
</P>
<P>
   But the technical merits of the waste disposal site are only
part of the tour. Jack rabbits skitter by. Castro points out the
soaptree yucca. He plucks small yellow berries from a poisonous
desert plant called a silver nightshade.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are used to curdle cheese even though the plants are
poisonous,'' Castro says. ``I remember gathering them for my
grandma as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Deer are abundant here, Castro says. There are javelina,
coyotes, snakes and turtles, whose well-being has been accounted
for in government environmental studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact,'' Castro says, ``we had an elk who used
to come and sit up here beneath a yucca and watch us work on the
trench. It was kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When the facility is built, Castro says, a double fence will
surround the property, to repel both human and animal visitors.
</P>
<P>
   THE RAINBOW: Dick Love retired as Hudspeth County sheriff five
years ago, and when I finally track him down, he's in an El Paso
hospital for tests. There will be no guided mountain tour on my
second trip to Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   So I set out alone in a rental car, south from town on the
blacktop of Farm Road 1111. The pavement turned to gravel after a
few miles and cut a beige ribbon through a broad valley toward the
Eagle Mountains. Earlier in the day, a rare storm had dumped badly
needed rain on the parched earth, but now the clouds were opening.
On the horizon toward Mexico was a huge, vertical rainbow. The sun
finally emerged through the clouds to the west, and in an instant,
the mountains were the brilliant orange I remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness closed in before I reached the border. The peaks were
blue silhouettes as I returned to town, dodging jack rabbits that
skipped across the headlights. I'd driven for an hour without
seeing another human soul. I felt fortunate to be back in one of
the prettiest parts of Texas. But as I drove, a question kept
nagging.
</P>
<P>
   What if the mountains could talk? And yucca? And elk? Would they
quietly accept a nuclear landfill next door? Maybe two trips in 10
years didn't entitle me to an opinion, but as the sun set over the
desert, I couldn't help but think that this was a terrible place
for a nuclear dump, a terrible place for a dump of any sort.

 STUTTGART, Germany: in England.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In America, where ballet has evolved alongside modern dance,
speed, abstract movement and virtuosity take precedence. Balanchine
and Cunningham reign supreme, and many critics tend to favor
pure-movement styles.
</P>
<P>
   The Cranko protege who first challenged Stuttgart Ballet's
dominance in Germany was Neumeier, who was born in Milwaukee. Like
Anderson, he trained at the Royal Ballet School in London. Unlike
Anderson, he became a choreographer as well as a director. ``It
never was my intention to be an expatriate, but the ball started to
roll,'' said Neumeier. ``I did some choreographies for an
experimental group in Stuttgart, and one of them became very
popular and it led to my being asked _ at a very young age _ to be
director of the Frankfurt Ballet.'' He accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, in 1973, the invitation to direct the Hamburg
Ballet extended Neumeier's stay in Germany. This year he celebrates
his 25th anniversary as head of the Hamburg company. During that
time, the ballet's space has expanded from what he describes as ``a
half an office and a half-day secretary'' to a nine-studio
building, Ballettzentrum Hamburg John Neumeier, housing both the
company and its school.
</P>
<P>
   Neumeier operates on a $7.2 million budget. ``We are also having
financial problems, but I am more able to take chances than, say,
at American Ballet Theater,'' he said. ``I know my dancers have
these contracts and they will have them next year. If I don't fire
them.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years with Hamburg Ballet, the choreographer found
``it was impossible'' to share his dancers with the opera: ``They
had to be used exclusively for the ballet company because we work
so much that it wouldn't really be possible for them to do it.
Aside from that, generally the work in opera is not really that
interesting or productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cragun, the California-born director of Deutsche Oper
Ballet, which continues to serve both functions, confirms this from
Berlin: ``A healthy ballet company should have the resources of the
opera house, but independence from the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, since the wall came down in 1989, Cragun's company
has had to compete for resources with two other major opera houses
and their dance troupes, leaving him with an ``unforeseeable''
future. He says his budget is ``a quarter to a third'' that of
Stuttgart's or Hamburg's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Schaefer, referring to the period that followed World
War II, wrote: ``Music and dance were still intelligible to all,
even in a world of hatred and resentment. The great hour arrived in
Germany for ballet, the nonlingual art.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its postwar prosperity is fading, dance continues to
hold a prominent position in the country's civic life. The German
public worships culture the way American audiences worship sports.
In Stuttgart, the ballet never advertises. ``We don't have to,''
Anderson said. ``Performances are always sold out. We don't even
have a marketing department.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hamburg, Neumeier has achieved celebrity status. The premiere
of his ``Bernstein Dances'' last month attracted front-page
coverage in The Hamburger Abendblatt. ``Wherever I would have ended
up _ China, New York or Hamburg _ I would have been a
choreographer,'' Neumeier said. ``But like a seed, a choreographer
grows slightly differently in whatever soil he's put in. So I guess
my soil _ German soil _ has been very fertile for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``Bernstein Dances,'' a ballet-revue choreographed to a
suite of Leonard Bernstein's compositions, coincides with the
festival's tribute to the prolific composer. The idea for the
ballet emerged in 1978, when Neumeier made a version of ``West Side
Story'' that Bernstein saw in Hamburg. ``He was very enthusiastic,
and we became friends,'' Neumeier said.
</P>
<P>
   For his 20th anniversary with the Hamburg company, Neumeier
created a ballet using Bernstein's ``Serenade'' and piano
compositions, called ``Anniversaries,'' that Bernstein wrote as
gifts for friends and lovers.
</P>
<P>
   When Harry Kraut, Bernstein's manager, saw this
``Bernstein-Serenade'' in 1993, he said to Neumeier: ``That was
wonderful. Could you imagine doing a whole evening of his works?
Maybe even using some his songs and shorter symphonic works?''
Neumeier describes ``Bernstein Dances'' as ``kind of biographical
because it does go through stages of a person's, an artist's,
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer thrives on complicated subjects. Previous
topics range from the Bible _ as in ``Joseph's Legend'' (1977) and
``St. Matthew's Passion'' (1981) _ to Bavaria, as in ``Illusions:
Like Swan Lake'' (1976), based on the life of King Ludwig. These
dramatic narratives recall Cranko's story-ballet genre, but
Neumeier also cites Sybil Shearer, Antony Tudor and Jerome Robbins
as choreographers he particularly admires.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Bernstein Dances,'' Neumeier asked Giorgio Armani to dress
the performers. Armani's 427 costumes include mini-skirts and
halter tops for the women and long-sleeved shirts and classic
Armani suits for the men. They give the production a sophisticated,
cosmopolitan look, and with its Italian, American and German
collaborators, ``Bernstein Dances'' becomes a sort of microcosm of
German ballet: a scene that is shaped today by a cast of
international artists.

JUST ONE MAN'S SOCIETY, BUT IT SPEAKS FOR MANY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Mary Johnson is editor of The Disability Rag's Ragged Edge
magazine, which covers the disability-rights movement.  
 By MARY JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon after ``If I Can't Do It'' begins, Walter Brock, the
filmmaker, faces the camera and addresses the viewer. Arthur
Campbell Jr., the subject of this documentary, ``thinks I should
tell my account of our first meeting right up front,'' says Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says it's the way society really feels about disabled
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock says that Campbell had been described to him only as a
disability-rights activist. He wasn't prepared to meet a man with
severe cerebral palsy and barely intelligible speech. He describes
his response: ``What kind of life could this guy have? Maybe the
most merciful thing to do would be to put him out of his misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, that response still shocks Brock. ``Where does
such prejudice come from?'' he asks himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three's Company'' it's not. But television viewers who assume
that this documentary profile of a disabled person could be of no
possible interest to them will miss a program that is ultimately
less about disabled people than about viewers' own feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I Can't Do It,'' which has its premiere on the PBS series
``P.O.V.'' on Tuesday at 10 p.m., seems a stunningly appropriate
observance right after Independence Day. This portrait of a
cantankerous activist-come-lately offers a vision not often seen on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The film may appear to deal only indirectly with the question of
prejudice as Campbell recounts his childhood, his escape from home
through a hunger strike and his later association with the
activists who gave shape and meaning to his life. But in fact,
prejudice is its overarching subject.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled people ``have suffered unspeakable torment _ and death
_ at the hands of their relatives and others, simply because they
do not look or do things as so-called normal people thought they
should,'' Campbell said in an e-mail interview, adding that they
are ``still denied the most basic of civil and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But our nation is not accustomed to thinking about the idea of
``disability prejudice.'' Scenes of activists kept out of
restaurants or off buses because of a lack of access haven't yet
generated the visceral response that most of us now feel when we
recall the ``white only'' and ``colored'' restrooms of the Old
South. We haven't had our consciousnesses raised.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us stick to our old convictions about what it's like to
be disabled. Campbell and his fellow protesters struggle to shake
those convictions but get little more than occasional random news
coverage (when Gallaudet University students demanded a deaf
college president in 1988, for instance, and when President Bush
signed the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990). The issues
that disability activists raise are merely isolated news incidents;
they don't seem to merit sustained coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the civil rights, women's rights and gay rights
movements, generating public enthusiasm for still another movement
is difficult. Yet of all movements, this one has the greatest
potential to humanize society: witness the concept of ``universal
design'' in housing, public buildings and products to make them
easier for everyone to use; the idea that living at home is better
than going to a nursing home; the advent of talking books,
voice-activated computers, television captioning that lets everyone
follow the game in a noisy sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet pundits grouse that disability rights just let malingerers
and malcontents claim victim status and soak the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   That grousing comes from prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell hopes viewers will pay attention to what Adapt
(American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today) protesters with
their diverse and severe disabilities say in the film. ``If they
can live in their own homes on their own, with support systems to
help them day to day, then why can't the other two and a half
million of their fellow disabled brothers and sisters _ those who
are rotting away both mentally and physically in the institutions
and nursing homes in this nation _ do the same?''
</P>
<P>
   We've been taught to ``believe that disability is unnatural and
unsightly,'' said Campbell, ``so when I see myself on film I
cringe, worrying about how others react to how I look and move.''
He attributes this feeling to the way he believes he was
``programmed'' to feel from the age of 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I was a burden, causing fights in my family,'' he
said. He felt that guilt well into his 40s, he says, calling it
``part of a disability mentality that most of us with disabilities
never grow out of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like myself couldn't, or weren't allowed to, move into
the community on their own; there were no funds to hire someone to
come in and get them out of bed, bathe them, do personal hygiene,
dress them, prepare meals,'' he said. He believes his work in the
1980s _ which resulted in Kentucky offering more in-home services,
predating Adapt's current focus _ is the most important thing he
has done. Yet calling himself ``a has-been,'' he has now abandoned
the activism that once defined his life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born to be a leader,'' he says in a voice-over while the
film shows him eluding the police at a demonstration. ``And the
truth is there ain't no way,'' he says, for a man with his CP
speech impediment to do that in today's society.
</P>
<P>
   His longing and frustration mirror the feelings of every
disability activist I've encountered. Ed Hooper, a disability
movement writer, once put it this way: ``Our words, no matter how
clearly we communicate them, no matter how many facts we marshal,
society hears as so much gibberish.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of belonging that Campbell found in Adapt has been the
salvation of many of his peers, salvation literally from suicide.
This belief in the saving grace of community spurs most disability
activists today.
</P>
<P>
   The group Not Dead Yet, for instance, offers a nuanced argument
that the so-called right to die has a disproportionate impact on
people with disabilities. Many have internalized the belief, as
Campbell once did, that they are useless burdens better off dead.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nation's still-unraised consciousness, however, Not
Dead Yet's analysis is dismissed by opinion makers who see all
right-to-die opposition as coming from the extreme political right.
</P>
<P>
   Activists rarely rebut conservatives' charges that the Americans
With Disabilities Act is out of control or that access is costing
the nation billions (it is one of today's more cost-effective
concepts). They don't write opinion pieces explaining why the
Supreme Court makes decisions like its recent ones validating the
disabilities act.
</P>
<P>
   The movers and shakers in the film _ Bob Kafka, Mike Auberger,
Cass Irvin _ are not yet the media equivalents of Gloria Steinem or
Larry Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   They're usually not credited for the changes they effect, a
point poignantly driven home by a weeping Shel Trapp, an Adapt
organizer, who sees a McDonald's commercial using sign language and
realizes with a start that an earlier Adapt protest demand has
borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adapt did that!'' he shouts to his wife in a scene roughly
halfway through the film. ``Adapt did that!'' Viewers will very
likely weep with Trapp. But then they should ask why Adapt has been
unsung for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Today Adapt is working to shift federal long-term-care financing
from nursing homes to in-home services, using the Americans With
Disabilities Act to force states to redirect federal money to keep
people free of nursing homes and pressing the Department of Justice
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   An Adapt-engineered bill in the House of Representatives (House
Resolution 2020, called Mi Casa) would move this agenda along. But
Mi Casa isn't on the nation's radar screen. ``The average person
could be behind this _ if they knew about it,'' says Mike Oxford,
an Adapt organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was leery of Brock's documentary idea at first: ``Most
filmmakers want to make us either some sympathetic, poor little
character that no one could have mature and normal relations with,
or some kind of a monster who has to be kept away and watched for
the safety of society or themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock is too astute to do this. Nevertheless, viewers may insist
on seeing Campbell's life as either inspiring or tragic. As
Campbell said, ``It's the way society really feels about
disability.''
</P>
<P>
   For such viewers, the personal here will never be political.
They won't recognize what this film has to do with their own lives,
even though all of us encounter illness and disability as we age.
But a film like ``If I Can't Do It'' can help us begin to
understand a new paradigm for our own futures. To not let it do so
would be the real tragedy.

 A '60s FREE SPIRIT WHOSE MAIN SUBJECT WAS HERSELF   (af)  
 Edward M. Gomez has written about and curated exhibitions of
Japanese modern art in Japan and the United States.  
 By EDWARD M. GOMEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How do you classify Yayoi Kusama? Art historians,
critics and even other artists have found it difficult to
categorize the work of the Japanese-born artist, whose career
flourished in New York during the 1960s but whose art is not
exactly Pop, or Minimalist, or psychedelic, or Abstract
Expressionist.
</P>
<P>
   But from today's late-post-modern vantage point, Ms. Kusama's
art shared affinities with or anticipated all of these tendencies
and others, too. They include performance art, body art,
``feminist'' art and art forms full of role-playing or mass-media
manipulation that anticipated those developed later by artists like
Cindy Sherman, Yasumasa Morimura and Jeff Koons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Forever: Yayoi Kusama, 1958-1968,'' an exhibition that
opens Thursday at the Museum of Modern Art, explores this
art-historical lineage and other themes in a survey of 70 of the
artist's seminal works from her formative years in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which remains on view through Sept. 22, includes
paintings, drawings, photographs, collages, sculptures, an
experimental film, three environmental installations and slides of
performance pieces.
</P>
<P>
   As a symbolic homecoming for Ms. Kusama to a city she adores but
left in 1973, ``Love Forever'' comes at a time of increasing
interest in '60s-era pop culture and of a surge in the career of
this reclusive Japanese artist, who is now 69 years old and who,
since 1977, has voluntarily resided in a Tokyo psychiatric
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For someone seemingly emblematic of the free-wheeling spirit of
the '60s, even in her heyday Ms. Kusama, was something of an
art-world outsider. Japan's art establishment ignored Ms. Kusama
for a long time, until her overseas accomplishments forced it to
give her greater recognition.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1989 mini-retrospective at the now-defunct Center for
International Contemporary Arts in Manhattan, organized by the
Japanese modern-art specialist Alexandra Munroe, thrust Ms. Kusama
back into the international limelight, the artist was chosen to
represent Japan at the 1993 Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kusama's fame did not come easily. She worked at it. As this
new show makes clear, she routinely put herself at the center of
her art and made special efforts to draw the attention of the news
media to her more sensational activities.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street nude-in and a body-painting event in Central Park,
for example, were a major part of her artistic project. ``This
artist transformed her persona into the most important work in her
oeuvre,'' says Laura Hoptman, an assistant curator at the Modern
and one of the show's organizers. ``It knits together the
paintings, sculptures and performances. They're Kusama's alter
ego.''
</P>
<P>
   For a Japanese woman, Ms. Kusama was unusually bold from the
beginning. She was one of four children who grew up in a well-to-do
rural household. Her father was mostly absent, and her mother
derided Yayoi's interest in art and her individualistic ways. She
even smeared and tore up her daughter's drawings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this tumultuous home life and wartime stress,
during childhood Ms. Kusama developed psychological disorders that
ultimately required psychiatric care. Emerging from deep anxiety,
her art has always been of and about obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to pursue art to cure my mental illness,'' Ms. Kusama
has often remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munroe has noted that Ms. Kusama's art is its maker's
attempt to beat the self-obliterating power of her malady, which
has been called obsessional neurosis. ``It appears that as Kusama
became more familiar with the formal symptoms of her illness and
its childhood sources, her art became to a greater and greater
extent the literal working-out of her disorders,'' Ms. Munroe
writes in the show's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, with a few shows already behind her, the young artist
left Japan for the United States, but only after she had first
written to Georgia O'Keeffe for help. ``It seems to me very odd
that you are so ambitious to show your paintings here, but I wish
the best for you,'' Ms. O'Keeffe replied rather frostily.
</P>
<P>
   After a stopover in Seattle for her first solo gallery show in
America, Ms. Kusama arrived in Manhattan in 1958, armed with some
2,000 of her watercolors and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Japan after the end of the long war, I felt a
sense of freedom in New York,'' the artist recalled in an interview
by fax from Tokyo. ``I was amazed, above all, by the high status of
women in society, far higher than in Japan. I did not leave Japan,
I fled Japan. Labeled as a lunatic, I had been ostracized from art
circles.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kusama immediately set out to find venues for her new works,
which, as her first solo outing 18 months later showed, quickly
assimilated the large-canvas proportions and techniques of the New
York School. These were the first of Ms. Kusama's ``infinity net''
paintings, whose all-over, intricately wrought net pattern, like
the ubiquitous polka dots that became her other signature motif,
had appeared in her earliest drawings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly all-white and monochromatic, these first `infinity net'
paintings made a perfect bridge between Abstract Expressionism and
what would later become known as Minimalism,'' says Lynn Zelevansky
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where ``Love Forever,''
which she curated with Ms. Hoptman, originated.
</P>
<P>
   In these works, hand labor is intensive, unlike the mechanical
processes of stenciling or silk-screening that the Pop artists
favored, and they exude an obsessive quality with their daunting
repetitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my sculpture and performance are a positive, my visionary
and apocalyptic paintings, which I have produced in large
quantities, are a negative,'' Ms. Kusama says. ``They spring up
from the bottom of my negative soul to heal it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kusama went on to develop soft sculptures in which she
covered armchairs, tables, high-heeled shoes and, most famously, an
entire rowboat with bulbous, phallic protrusions. Painted silver or
bright colors with polka dots, these creations, which she often
presented in installation groupings, gave physical form to her
obsessional neurosis. Even today, they possess an eerie, erotic
allure. They have frequently been described as fetishistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Forever'' features many classics of this genre, which
presaged the pop sculptor Claes Oldenburg's switch from
papier-mache to soft materials, including ``Accumulation No. 1''
(1962) and ``Aggregation: One Thousand Boats Show'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggregation'' incorporated 999 posters of the rowboat
sculpture, covering the walls around it. Andy Warhol saw and
admired Ms. Kusama's showing of this full-scale environment at the
Gertrude Stein Gallery in 1963, before he produced his own ``Cow
Wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   A famous image from that time shows Ms. Kusama posing nude, her
backside to the camera, at the edge of her surreal boat. In fact,
she appears in nearly all the photographs of her work from the New
York era that ``Love Forever'' documents. ``She was and is not
separable from it,'' Ms. Zelevansky says. ``She animated the art.''
Ms. Zelevansky describes this role of Ms. Kusama's within or
alongside her artworks, where she was often seen, as her art's
distinctly ``performative'' aspect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kusama befriended many other artists in New York, including
Barnett Newman, Donald Judd and Joseph Cornell, who adored her and
sent her collaged billets-doux from his Utopia Parkway retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, her intensely personal work shared certain
art-as-object, abstract characteristics with that of participants
in the German Zero and Dutch Nul groups with whom she exhibited.
But as ``Love Forever'' demonstrates and Ms. Hoptman emphasizes:
``Kusama always went her own way. She was never a joiner.''
</P>
<P>
   That individualism, her drive and her survival story have
endeared Ms. Kusama to younger artists who have discovered her rich
visual vocabulary and prescient treatment of now-timely themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a unique bridge between outsider art and fine art,''
says Jon Waldo, a New York painter and ceramics artist with folk
art and rock-and-roll roots. Others note the links between Ms.
Kusama's ``sex and food obsession'' works, like her mid-1960s
macaroni-encrusted shirts and handbags, and the current concern
about bulimia and anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   And many viewers have been moved by the alchemical aura of the
Japanese artist's creations, in which, like Eva Hesse or Louise
Bourgeois, she powerfully transforms the meaning and nature of her
materials.
</P>
<P>
   In her newest works, on view at the Robert Miller Gallery
through Aug. 7, Ms. Kusama has applied her infinity nets to Venus
de Milo statues. She has also made elegant updated ``accumulation''
works featuring clusters of plump phallic protuberances, Barbie
dolls and even kitchen utensils painted gold.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, ``Kusama wasn't really right for the 60s,'' Ms.
Zelevansky says. ``But she had great antennae. She has always been
a very sophisticated artist, and in these pluralistic times, people
really are interested in and respond to her kind of idiosyncrasy.''

`AMERICAN STORIES: THE AMERICAN DREAM': AMERICA'S ESSENCE IN
ANECDOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(bl) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American Stories: The American Dream,'' from the Discovery
Channel, is a discount version of ``People's Century,'' the 26-part
world-history lesson that started on PBS in April and promises to
carry on into the 20th century's twilight.
</P>
<P>
   Both productions offer resounding events as experienced by
people who were caught up in them: history from below. But the
Discovery Channel series, which arrives Saturday, concentrates on
the United States and does the job in a mere five hours.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of oral history and newsreels has a natural appeal
for the television producer; eyewitness drama comes more readily to
the camera than intellectual depth. At its most effective, the form
can be stirring; the pictures from the archives combined with the
accounts of how war and weather, reform and rebellion touched or
transformed the lives of individuals and families invite empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``American Stories'' is not all that effective.
There are moving moments, but many scenes will seem familiar, even
derivative, to fans of more innovative historical excursions,
notably ``The American Experience.'' The writing keeps edging into
platitude (a line like ``His name was Franklin D. Roosevelt'' must
be aimed at children), and the history is thin.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is to concentrate on 10 people who lived through
upheavals like the stock market crash, World War II, the Vietnam
War, the civil-rights movement and what has come to be known as the
Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday night's opening hour, we meet Oklahoma and Arkansas
farmers who lost everything to dust storms and Depression and
braved the hard trip to California in search of paradise; a scion
of the patrician Peabody clan, embodiment of the East Coast
establishment, who wound up as governor of Massachusetts; two Ford
automobile workers, one black, one white, who fought together in
union-organizing battles, and an offspring of Jewish immigrants who
went from the family delicatessen to prosperity via the City
College of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture of success and failure, of grand hopes and bitter
disappointments gives force to the memories. The white Ford worker,
an immigrant from Malta, says, ``I thought I was in heaven here,''
but his black co-worker remembers the factory as ``a hell on
earth.'' The former student credits City College with turning
success ``from a possibility to a real probability,'' but the farm
woman whose family was uprooted says, ``You felt unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The people are easy to identify with, and their recollections
seem honest. But even by undemanding television standards,
``American Stories'' delivers what viewers have already seen and
heard in superior documentaries, and some of the personal
interludes, like the Peabody romance, are just dull. The packaging
is efficient, but the narration, delivered by Peter Fonda, is
relentlessly conventional, in the spirit of a play-it-safe
junior-high textbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stories,'' he reports, ``take us to the heart and soul
of the American dream.'' It seems to me they take us mainly where
we have already been many times.
</P>

`TALK TO ME': BETTY AND VERONICA SEEK A GUY WHO'S NO JUGHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Betty and Veronica are the focal females of ``Talk to Me,'' but
the action is far from the teen-age angst of Archie Comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to Me'' may have been made in 1996, but it is very much
at home in 1998 because it revolves around telephone sex.
</P>
<P>
   In this amiable, modest romantic comedy, Betty and Veronica are
facing the dread age of 30, and the romantic lives of these New
Yorkers are not in the best of shape.
</P>
<P>
   Betty hasn't had sex in nine months. Veronica, or Ronnie as she
is known, is still dating Stuart even though they have broken up
because he said he wasn't ready for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   So one night Betty (Cheryl Clifford) succumbs to the temptation
to dial the ``900'' number of the Universe of Love (``Tired of
being judged before a person can get to know the real you?''), and
soon she finds herself smitten with the voice of a young man named
Arnold Dowling (Peter Welch).
</P>
<P>
   And not long after that, they are involved in a private
telephonic chat, shucking off clothes and acting out a fantasy
about a cleaning woman in a blue uniform, a white apron and high
heels and some sudsy water.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold, it seems, has a problem, which his brother Michael
(Gary Navicoff), a psychiatrist, is trying to address. Arnold, an
architect, has been traumatized by a devastating office romance.
After a year, without warning, Maggie, Arnold's love, turned up one
day wearing another man's engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   What he cannot stand, therefore, is a liar, and what he has not
yet discovered is that the woman he knows on the telephone only as
Miranda is actually Betty.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one day Betty will actually track down the reticent
Arnold, and they will have a date, which will lead to
complications. And in the meantime, Veronica (Elizabeth Landis),
will also decide to let her fingers do the trolling, which leads
her into the lair and limo of the suave Frederick (Ralph Romeo).
</P>
<P>
   George Esguerra, who produced and directed ``Talk to Me'' and
wrote the screenplay with Robert Foulkes, displays a nice
understanding of the scars of the dating game, the difficulties of
the mating game, the uses of guises and the elements of human
comedy. ``Talk to Me'' holds no special surprises and reaches no
heights of hilarity, but Betty and Arnold prove to be the sort of
decent people who deserve a happy ending.

 GREAT TROUBLEMAKER, LOUSY PRESIDENT   (EDS.: First 2 graphs may be
set in italic.)
 By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ...It is this arm, this right arm, that North Vietnamese
torturers worked over for days in a hellhole called the Plantation,
till it was broken and bruised and lacerated. It is this arm, this
right arm, that is still stiff, still scarred, still bent. And it
is this arm, this right arm, that the avaricious barons of tobacco,
who sell death and call it commerce, think they can twist, think
they can break, think they can make reach out to them, open-palmed.
</P>
<P>
   But, you see, they don't understand that this arm has a man
attached to it. And they don't understand that the man is Sen. John
McCain, who is allergic to their blandishments and threats, just as
he is allergic to the cozy, sleazy compromises of this dark city,
just as he is allergic to the mendacious hypocrisies of politics as
it is practiced in late-20th century America. For Sen. John McCain
is the last _____ (man of honor, hero, honest man, saint ...) in
American politics. And perhaps, if we are very lucky, he is our
next president ...
</P>
<P>
   Political journalism, like all professions, depends on the
formula--the ritual ``Newt is doomed'' or ``Clinton will survive
anything'' stories. During the past year, there has been a
significant addition to the Washington media formulary: the John
McCain profile. It can be boiled down to this: He was our bravest
Vietnam prisoner of war. Now he's the only senator courageous
enough to tell the truth. He is battling evil cigarette lobbyists
and Senate money-grubbers. He may lose, but he won't quit. In 2000,
he'll run for president. We don't deserve someone this honorable.
Vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair, Time and
countless newspapers have sanctified the Arizona Republican in this
way. Mike Wallace has said he would consider quitting 60 Minutes to
aid a McCain 2000 campaign. As far as the national media are
concerned, McCain can do no wrong. When his tobacco bill was shot
down, The New York Times declared the defeat would only burnish his
reputation. When he got caught telling a dumb, nasty joke about
Chelsea Clinton--the kind of crack that might cripple the career of
someone else in Congress--he apologized immediately, was forgiven
by the president, and the love-in continued.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why McCain has been anointed the media's
favorite presidential hopeful. He is irresistible. In a Senate
populated by grasping automatons, he behaves like an actual human
being. Probably because of his 5 1/2 year imprisonment, he is
impatient with the euphemisms and lies of politics. (Bob Dole once
said of him, ``You spend five years in a box and you're entitled to
speak your mind.'') McCain cracks jokes, dishes dirt and generally
mocks the hypocrisies and failings of his colleagues (and himself).
The more his colleagues spin and position themselves, the better he
looks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has the appeal of the maverick. The press loves
Republican traitors, and McCain's willingness to buck his party
bosses on campaign finance and tobacco makes great copy. (If he
were a Democrat leading the fight against tobacco and campaign
corruption, no one would care.) There is something heroic about a
politician who seems to act against his immediate self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain benefits, too, from the general swoon about his history.
He is an awesome man. He doesn't need to talk about the war:
Reporters, most of whom never served in the military, are paralyzed
by him. His indisputable bravery and honor inoculate him against
charges of base motives.
</P>
<P>
   And he makes himself phenomenally accessible. According to
Arizona reporters, he's ill-tempered and vindictive toward the
local press; but he charms the socks off national reporters. He
interrupts family vacations to appear on cable news and rises at
ungodly hours on foreign trips to do TV interviews. He has a knack
for flattering reporters. Other politicians obviously stage-manage
media encounters. McCain, by contrast, is transparent. He confides
in reporters. He holds conversations with his children in front of
them. He asks them for advice. (Tip to pols: No. 1 way to ensure a
favorable article is to ask the reporter for advice.)
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain hagiography is not harmless. It misleads the
American people, and it will disserve him if he does run for
president. He isn't just an honorable, truth-seeking hero, a
selfless iconoclast. He's a schemer, a politician, a calculating
populist who has built his career on sexy, attention-getting
issues. He is opportunistic. He arrived at a convenient time in the
tobacco fight: He had no strong feelings about the evil weed, and
he became the tobacco scourge only when Republican leaders asked
him to shepherd the bill through the Senate. He adopted campaign
finance reform only after he was tarred in the Keating Five scandal
several years ago. Others who've devoted years to campaign finance
and tobacco have watched McCain get credit as the heroic martyr,
the patron saint of lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   What's more pernicious about the coverage is that it confuses
the qualities of a crusader with those of a president. McCain is
often praised as an independent legislator, but no one ever points
out that he's a rather ineffective one. He is unpopular in the
Senate. Some of his Republican colleagues dislike him for selfish
reasons--they envy his popularity and resent his outsider stances.
(``His colleagues feel he's a showboat and a camera hog,'' says
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.) But they
also dislike him for good reasons. McCain resists the political
horse trading that underlies legislating: He has said he has no
plans to modify the tobacco bill to get it passed. (Well, why not?)
Similarly, he infuriates senators with grandstanding attacks on
pork, being a master at publicizing and eliminating other senators'
sweetheart projects. He does not recognize quid pro quo politics.
</P>
<P>
   This naked, righteous populism makes McCain a superb advocate on
campaign finance and tobacco. And there is certainly something
romantic in the notion that America needs an honorable,
truth-telling president like him. But there is also something
foolish in it. McCain is a contrarian, someone whose life is
defined by lonely opposition. He was a pilot, not a platoon leader.
He resisted his captors alone and endured years in solitary
confinement. At the Naval Academy, McCain was nicknamed ``Punk,''
and that's what he is. He suspects authority and challenges
orthodoxy. It's why he's a great story and a great troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   It's also why he would make a lousy president. Being president
is not about bucking authority, it's about being authority. It's
not about resisting coercion, it's about coercing, and bargaining,
and sucking up, and twisting arms, and telling little lies. John
McCain thinks that's beneath him. So he should stay in the Senate
and continue to make trouble.

 HEGEMON AND PROUD OF IT  
 By STROBE TALBOTT 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American soccer team had a tough week in June at the World
Cup in France, losing to the Iranians and then the Yugoslavs. The
cheering around the world stopped short of classic
anti-Americanism, but it went beyond mere appreciation for two
games well played. In many quarters of the globe, there seemed to
be a sense of relief: Whew! At least here was one genuinely level
playing field on which the United States was just another
contender, not a superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that Uncle Sam is too big for his britches is almost
as popular an international sport as soccer itself. Lately, an old
word has resurfaced: The United States stands accused of
hegemonism. Didn't this musty term figure in Thucydides'
description of how Sparta feared the rising power of Athens? And
wasn't it a Maoist code word during the Sino-Soviet dispute (as in,
``dig tunnels deep, store grain everywhere, and never seek
hegemony'')?
</P>
<P>
   Yet today the H-word is commonly used to denounce, among other
things, the U.S. practice of certifying other nations' cooperation
in the war on drugs and U.S. laws that punish foreign corporations
for doing business with state sponsors of terrorism. Even the U.S.
policy of promoting democracy and human rights is sometimes labeled
hegemonist. There is plenty of room for legitimate debate about
where the line is between advancing universal values and imposing
our own values on others; or when our country should act alone,
when in concert with others. But these days U.S. power is subject
to a form of ambivalence verging on antagonism--even from
allies--that goes beyond the merits and motivations of this or that
particular criticism.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about other nations resenting U.S.
influence on their political, economic, and cultural lives. But
with the end of the Cold War, America-bashing--or at least
America-tweaking--is enjoying a new boom. That's in part because of
the end of the Cold War. Other nations tended to muffle or modulate
their occasional annoyance with the country that was their shield
against the Soviet threat. Now they feel less constrained.
</P>
<P>
   It is sometimes easier for other governments to complain about
what they depict as a swaggering, cock-of-the-roost American
attitude than it is to tackle us head-on over substantive issues.
Besides, taking potshots at Washington is often good local
politics: Blaming a faraway caricature of the United States can
deflect attention from shortcomings, or worse, closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Much criticism of America these days has a damned if we
do/damned if we don't quality. Many of the same voices accuse us of
arrogance when we assert ourselves and of failure of nerve or
vision when we encourage them to take the lead in their own region.
Today we are Rambo, while only yesterday we were Forrest Gump.
</P>
<P>
   The former Yugoslavia is an example. In 1993, Europeans berated
us for conditioning our participation in Bosnia on transatlantic
consensus. More recently, some of those same officials and pundits
have griped about our determination to apply tough and, if
necessary, military measures in response to the dangerous and
deteriorating situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar schizoid aspect to the reaction of some of
our friends to U.S. policies toward the Asian financial crisis and
the nuclear rivalry between India and Pakistan. Both problems are
too vast for us to be able to address alone, yet both require us to
play a central role in orchestrating an effective international
</P>
<P>
   defense of common interests. That means we must combine
coalition building with direct approaches to the parties. We have
supported efforts by international financial institutions to stop
the plunge of Asian economies. We also have talked directly--very
directly--to Japan about the economic reforms it needs. Our attempt
to defuse the crisis between India and Pakistan began with
emergency meetings of the foreign ministers of the P-5 (the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council) and the G-8 (the
seven major industrialized democracies, plus Russia). But the
United States has also conducted quiet diplomacy with the two
countries involved.
</P>
<P>
   These two cases illustrate the need to pursue U.S. interests on
two tracks--together as possible and alone as necessary (or, in
diplomatic jargon, multilaterally and unilaterally). In an
increasingly interdependent world, many pressing problems that
affect Americans can be addressed only through cooperation with
other countries. The spread of nuclear and biological weapons, the
growth of international organized crime, and global environmental
degradation are a few examples.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of U.S. diplomacy is getting sovereign states
to work together voluntarily. Coercion isn't appropriate and won't
work. The United States has got to be careful not to strut its
stuff in ways that might disincline other countries from
cooperating with it. We should lead by example and suasion.
</P>
<P>
   We have a solid basis for doing so. Uniquely in the history of
Great Powers, the United States defines its greatness not as an
ability to dominate others but as an ability to work with others in
the interest of the international community. For Americans, that
phrase ``international community'' is not abstract or cynical or
euphemistic; and we try to make good on its implications. U.S.
foreign policy strives for a consensus among like-minded states on
behalf of common interests that we can and should champion
together.
</P>
<P>
   We do this not out of philanthropy but out of enlightened
self-interest. We believe that when democracy and prosperity and
security advance anywhere around the globe, it enhances the
freedom, prosperity, and security of the United States as well.
After World War II the United States led the world in the design
and construction of a superstructure made up of the United Nations,
NATO, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the World Bank,
and the International Monetary Fund. These institutions helped
bring bitter adversaries into a framework of mutual support and
benefit. Now these organizations that served what we used to think
of as ``the West'' and ``the North'' are opening up to the
developing and democratizing nations of the East and the South. And
the United States is also leading the creation of new international
institutions: the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the
North Atlantic Free Trade Association, the World Trade
Organization, the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change, and the
Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to apologize for our leadership role. But there
is room for improvement in our leadership style. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has asked those of us who speak publicly for the
United States to make a conscious effort not to sound smug,
patronizing, or hectoring. That includes talking about foreign
policy here in the United States. In the information age, what
senior U.S. government officials say to an American audience is
very likely to be heard or read around the world. What plays well
in Peoria, Ill., might sound offensive in Panama City or Paris--to
mention two capitals where there is special sensitivity to any hint
of U.S. hegemonism. (She isn't ordering us to pull our
punches--just to be more conscious of what punches we're landing
where, and to what intended effect.)
</P>
<P>
   While taking account of foreign sensitivities to American
assertiveness, we must also be on our guard against a domestic
temptation in the opposite direction. Today some
Americans--including influential members of Congress--also worry
about U.S. hegemonism, but from a different perspective. They warn
that in the name of exercising international leadership, we are
foolishly risking our country's blood and treasure in faraway lands
of which we know little. This concern--misguided and
misguiding--loomed large last fall in congressional opposition to
Fast Track, and it is present again today in opposition to paying
our share of support for the IMF and our overdue bills to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, the United States can handle
complaints about the style and even the substance of our engagement
with the world. Better that than disengagement or a return to the
isolationism of more than half a century ago. &QL;

 DEALWARD HO!  
 By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the history of American business over the last 15 years is
written, one of the riddles that will have to be solved is how Wall
Street could simultaneously believe that mergers, spin-offs and
divestment were all excellent strategies for unlocking
``shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one size does not fit all, and it's certainly true
that mergers make sense for some companies (though for many fewer
than have merged in the past five years) while other corporations
are better-served by spinning off or selling non-core operations.
The problem is no clear rationale for distinguishing between these
different situations has really emerged, making it seem as if deals
are being done just because CEOs feel they need to do something.
</P>
<P>
   So last week we had the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal, which promises to create
an integrated cable-telephone giant that will, on its own, offer
consumers everything they could ever want. This week we have Hilton
splitting itself into two, creating separate hotel and gaming
companies; Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. announcing that it will be
spinning off Fox; and Republic Services, the waste-management
portion of Wayne Huizenga's auto-dealership company Republic, spun
off in an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   If last week we were supposed to think that size brought with it
economies of scale and unbeatable reach, this week we're apparently
supposed to think that smaller is better, and that companies are
more likely to turn in solid bottom-line results if they're
independent rather than divisions of larger corporations.
</P>
<P>
   What's really at work here, of course, are two different things.
First is the tremendous bias toward action--any action--that's been
created by the boom in M&AMP;A activity and in public offerings over
the past few years. Second, and not unrelated, is the unrelenting
pressure on executives to keep their stock prices high.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. will continue to own 80 percent of Fox, but unless
Fox is going to be run qualitatively differently as an independent,
its revenue and earnings will not change. What will change, News
Corp. hopes, is the stock market's valuation of that revenue. Fox
won't be making more dollars, but investors will value its dollars
more highly since it's standing alone. The same principle is even
more strongly at work in the Hilton deal. Investors are justifiably
leery of the gaming industry because of slowing revenues and the
possibility that there are just too many casinos in America (God
forbid). By quarantining its successful hotel business from its
gaming operations, Hilton expects a windfall as investors rush to
buy the hotel stock.
</P>
<P>
   One would assume, of course, that they would also rush to sell
the gaming stock, just as one might reasonably assume that News
Corp. without Fox is worth considerably less than News Corp. with
it. But the governing assumption is that in a market as flush with
capital as this one, the gains you reap from spinning off a company
will outweigh whatever losses the old company will sustain.
</P>
<P>
   None of this makes any sense, of course, if you assume--as we
should--that in evaluating a business investors evaluate all the
different parts of that business as well. But let us not be
deterred by the absence of logic. Dealward, ho! &QL;

 TAKEN TO THE CLEANERS  
 By STEVEN E. LANDSBURG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My dry cleaner charges $1.65 to clean and press a man's shirt
and $5.25 for a woman's blouse. What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   The laws of arithmetic allow only two possibilities. Women's
clothing must be associated either with higher costs or with higher
profit margins for the dry cleaner. Unfortunately, neither theory
seems terribly plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the ``higher cost'' theory. In its most naive
form, this theory predicts that if I move the buttons on my dress
shirts from the right side to the left, the cost of laundering them
will more than triple. That one's not going to fly. So, to give the
theory a fair chance, we have to look for more significant
differences between men's and women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, like what? You could argue that women's clothing is
typically made of more delicate fabrics than men's. But if that's
the relevant factor, why don't dry cleaners just quote different
prices for different fabrics? (For some materials, such as silk,
they typically do quote separate prices. The question is why this
practice does not completely displace that of distinguishing
between men's clothes and women's.)
</P>
<P>
   An alternative version of the theory is that women's clothes are
costlier to process because women demand higher quality work. I
can't disprove that version, but I have no real evidence to support
it, either. So, in a search for better alternatives, I called three
different dry cleaners and asked for their explanations. The first
said that men's shirts are machine pressed, while women's are hand
pressed. That left me wondering why they don't simply quote
different prices for different kinds of pressing. The second said
that women's shirts require specialized treatment because they are
typically doused with perfume. That left me wondering why men who
use after-shave are not chronically dissatisfied with their dry
cleaners. The third said that this was their pricing policy, and if
I didn't like it, I was free to shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a clear, convincing story about
gender-specific costs, let's see what kind of story we can tell
about gender-specific profit margins. In other words, let's ask
whether my dry cleaner is exploiting female customers through
higher markups.
</P>
<P>
   To make sense of that theory, you have to ask why dry cleaners
would want to discriminate specifically against women, as opposed
to, say, men. That strategy makes sense only if men are more
price-sensitive than women and hence more likely to walk away in
the face of a high markup. But why should men be more
price-sensitive? You could argue that men are less diligent about
cleanliness and so more likely to respond to high prices by wearing
unlaundered shirts. But as long as we're dealing in stereotypes,
you could argue equally well that women are more willing to do
their own laundry--in which case women would be more likely to walk
away from a high price, and it would make more sense to
discriminate against men.
</P>
<P>
   So it isn't clear which gender is the more natural candidate for
getting soaked at the cleaners. But there's a more fundamental
reason to doubt that either gender can be victimized by price
discrimination, and here it is: There are over half a dozen dry
cleaners within easy walking distance of my house. If they're all
earning higher profits on women's blouses than on men's shirts, why
hasn't any of them decided to specialize in women's blouses?
</P>
<P>
   Let me make that more concrete. Suppose the going prices are
$1.65 for a man's shirt and $5.25 for a woman's blouse, even though
(under the theory we're currently entertaining) they are equally
expensive for the cleaner to handle. Then if I were a dry cleaner,
I would announce a uniform price of $5 for all shirts and
blouses--thereby attracting all the women's business and none of
the men's. Because nobody has adopted that obvious strategy, we
should suspect that despite appearances, the profit margin on
women's clothing can't be much higher than on men's.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the process wouldn't stop there. As soon as I announced
a uniform price of $5, my neighbor would announce a price of $4.75.
Ongoing competition for the (temporarily) more lucrative women's
business would quickly eliminate any profit differential.
</P>
<P>
   That argument rests on the fact that dry cleaners are highly
competitive. If Microsoft ran the entire dry cleaning industry, it
might very well choose to discriminate against women (or men,
depending on market conditions). But in the world we live in--or at
least in the neighborhood I live in--there are so many
interchangeable dry cleaners that none of them should be able to
get away with exploiting anyone. One of my colleagues' wives
insists I've got this wrong--she says she's so loyal to her own dry
cleaner that no discounter can lure away her business. If most
customers are as devoted as she is, then each dry cleaner is like a
mini-Microsoft, with its own captive customer base. In that case,
price discrimination can survive. But I am instinctively skeptical
that many customers are as fanatically loyal as my colleague's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The theory that only a monopolist can price discriminate is
standard textbook fare, and it's borne out by a lot of
observations. Movie theaters have a certain amount of monopoly
power (on a given night, a given moviegoer is likely to have a
strong preference for a particular movie at a particular theater),
and they price discriminate by offering discounts to senior
citizens (which is equivalent to discriminating against everybody
under the age of 65). Airlines have even more monopoly power--once
you know where and when you want to fly, you are likely to have an
extremely limited choice of airlines--and they heavily discriminate
against business travelers by charging more for midweek flights
than for weekend flights (when most travel is for leisure).
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the most competitive industries, there is no
price discrimination. As I am fond of pointing out to my students,
you've never heard of a wheat farmer who offers senior citizen
discounts. Likewise for gas stations, which are ubiquitous and sell
to everyone at a single price.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least that's what I used to tell my students. But I
might have to make a small change in my lesson plan. The gas
station nearest our campus has just announced a policy of senior
citizen discounts on Wednesday afternoons. Is this price
discrimination in favor of seniors, or does it reflect a genuinely
lower cost of serving them?
</P>
<P>
   If you push me hard enough, I can probably concoct some kind of
story about lower costs. Maybe seniors tend to drive cars with
bigger gas tanks, so they buy 20 gallons at a time instead of 10,
thereby saving on the cost of processing credit cards. (A
significant part of that cost is the time spent waiting for the
card to be approved, during which the pump is unavailable.) But if
this cost saving is significant, why has only one local gas station
recognized it? And why is it significant only on Wednesdays?
</P>
<P>
   I have suggested to my colleagues that none of us should be
permitted to present ourselves to the world as economists until we
figure out what this gas station is up to. Nobody has risen to the
challenge. A few have suggested that perhaps the gas station owner
is just a little quirky. Maybe that's right. But it would be far
harder to believe that the entire dry cleaning industry is just a
little quirky. Either there is enough monopoly power to sustain
price discrimination, or there is some reason why women's clothes
are incredibly expensive to clean and press. But I have no idea
which.

   NIGERIA (United Nations) _ Nigeria's new military government
pledged today to release all remaining political prisoners,
Secretary General Kofi Annan said after meeting with the country's
President, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. Annan said among those freed
would be Moshood K.O. Abiola, who apparently won a presidential
election in 1993, but was arrested for trying to take office after
Nigeria's military rulers annulled the vote. By Barbara Crossette.

   RUSSIA-GAZPROM (Moscow) _ Russia's legendarily ineffectual tax
men stared down the nation's biggest and most powerful corporation
today, threatening to seize control of the firm _ and its
executives' dachas, yachts and other perks _ unless it coughed up
billions of rubles in back taxes and billions more every month
hereafter. To most everyone's amazement, the company, Gazprom, gave
in. By the end of a day filled with bluster and rumor, Gazprom had
agreed to start paying the government monthly taxes of about four
billion rubles, or some $645 million, and to turn over another 4.2
billion rubles in unpaid taxes by Monday. By Michael Wines.

<P>
   NIRELAND-BLAIR (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Arsonists believed
to be members of a dissident Protestant group set fire to 10 Roman
Catholic churches in Northern Ireland early today and late
Wednesday night, setting off fears that wider sectarian violence
might return to in the British province. The police and officials
said the arson was probably the work of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force, a Protestant group opposed to the peace effort that has
produced cooperation between Protestants and Catholics in a new
provincial assembly. In an unusual move for a British Prime
Minister, Tony Blair flew to the province today to try to dispel
rising tension in this predominantly Protestant British province.

<P>
   DIANA-MUSEUM (Great Brington, England) _ If there were any
dissenters here who found it all a bit much _ the rush of cars on
once-quiet country roads; the $15 commemorative pillboxes; the
fresh expressions of grief that made it seem almost as if Diana,
the Princess of Wales, died last week instead of last August _ they
were mostly keeping quiet Thursday. ``I don't want to talk to you,
and I don't want to give my opinion,'' said one woman, answering
the door at her cottage not far from the gates of Althorp House,
Diana's childhood home. She did agree to sell a jar of homemade
honey, though, for $2.50. ``You should have seen the crowds
yesterday. One person was very rude.'' The crowds were bound, of
course, for Althorp, where Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, opened a
$5 million shrine (and a cafe and gift shop) to her memory on
Tuesday. By Sarah Lyall.

   SWISS-BANKS (Undated) _ The Swiss government said in a private
meeting that it has no intention of restoring any of the billions
of dollars in gold, cash and jewelry that the Nazis stole from
Holocaust victims and then sold to the Swiss government to raise
cash for war material, Alan G. Hevesi, the city controller, said
Thursday. Hevesi disclosed the remarks, made in a closed door
meeting of state and local government finance officers by the Swiss
ambassador, Jacques Reverdin, in announcing escalating sanctions
against Swiss banks, and ultimately all Swiss corporations, that
New York city and state will take unless restitution is made. By

in the Italian alps in February could be convicted in a
court-martial, a hearing officer found in a report released

   JULY4-RISKS (Washington) _ The hottest holiday argument this
weekend may be between partisans of wet or dry barbecue, or over
whether a day at the beach is worth half a day spent in traffic.
But there were Independence Days two centuries ago when the
consummate celebration of American nationalism decayed into bitter
disputes between rival political parties, exceeding even the
political passions that the early Republic displayed for the other
364 days of the year. At a lecture this week in the National
Archives, historian Len Travers of the Massachusetts Historical
Society described how the day became ensconced as a central rite of
the emerging republic. In those days, a fellow could be beaten for
wearing the wrong party's colors on his hat, and Boston routinely
threw two separate celebrations, each controlled by one of the two
contending political parties of the day. By John H. Cushman Jr.

   FLA-FIRES (Ormond Beach, Fla.) _ At least 80 homes and other

the fires ravaging two counties were only expected to get bigger
Thursday. By Mireya Navarro. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLIMBING-MT-MCKINLEY (Talkeetna, Alaska) _ The cemetery in this
risk-lover's domain should be enough to keep most people from
trying to stand atop the High One, as Athabaskan natives call Mount
McKinley. The climbers came from all over the world, drawn to the
highest point in North America, and they ended up with their names
on granite here _ 118 dead over the last 65 years. But there is no
sense of horror or defeat in the summer shadows. After nearly a
monthlong disappearance behind a cloak of mist and storms, the
mountain is out _ a hulk of luminous ice pressing the upper reaches
of the sky at 20,320 feet. So, even though three people have died
so far this climbing season, McKinley is more of a lure than ever
before. By Timothy Egan.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The hot economy is showing definite
signs of cooling, but by only a few degrees. In June, the Labor
Department reported Thursday, unemployment edged up to 4.5 percent
and the pace of job creation slowed, dropping to 205,000 from more
than 300,000 in the two previous months. There were other signs of
moderation. Total hours worked dipped a bit, a clear indication
that the nation's gross domestic productthe output of goods and
services was growing much more slowly than last winter. The
moderation, however, follows a very torrid pace of the last six
months. By any historical standard, job creation remains robust and
unemployment very low indeed. Just one year ago, jobelessness stood
at 5 percent. And theres no sign in Thursday's report that the
economy was tipping into recessionas some bears have been saying.

<P>
   Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Bosworth. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. The
daughter of Bartley C. Crum, the famous corporate lawyer of the
1940's and 50's and champion of leftist causes, tracks the dazzling
arc of her father's life, including his undoing by his personal and
political furies. Last year our reviewer, Richard Lingeman, called
this a ''multilayered act of discovery and reconciliation . . . in
which redemption comes from the truth of the telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Underworld
</P>
<P>
   By Don DeLillo. Scribner, $16. This sprawling wake for the cold
war explores how people rearranged their lives around the moral
void of Mutual Assured Destruction, with its attending terror and
absurdity. Selected by the editors of the Book Review as one of the
best books of 1997, the novel spans half a century, from its
opening in 1951 at one of baseball's legendary games to its
epilogue in central Asia. The characters - both fictional and
cultural heroes like Frank Sinatra and Lenny Bruce - are
psychological fallout victims. '' 'Underworld' surges with
magisterial confidence,'' Martin Amis said here last year. ''It
isn't every day, or even every decade, that one sees the ascension
of a great writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Resurrection: The Struggle for a New Russia
</P>
<P>
   By David Remnick. Vintage, $15. The author argues that the
Russian people have had their fill of Boris N. Yeltsin and the
oligarchs who gained power after his re-election in 1996. ''As a
gifted journalist, with an eye for the broad themes as well as the
telling details of a story, he provides us with an amplitude of
particulars'' about the miseries that have occurred during
Yeltsin's reign of deception and criminality, Abraham Brumberg
wrote here last year. The thesis of Petersburg, Crucible of
Cultural Revolution, by Katerina Clark (Harvard University,
$18.95), is that the city's idealistic artists and intellectuals
during the tumultuous years between 1913 and 1931 created an
atmosphere that made the Great Terror of the late 1930's possible.
This revisionist account is ''a major contribution to the cultural
history of this seminal period,'' Harlow Robinson said in the Book
Review in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Blessing
</P>
<P>
   By Nancy Mitford. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95. This spirited riff on
French-British relations on the highest social plane pits a
beautiful English wife and her charming French nobleman husband
against a diabolical villain: their young son. The result is a
''cunningly constructed, artfully written . . . farce of the most
civilized kind,'' Elizabeth Janeway wrote here in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Imagining Robert. My Brother, Madness, and Survival: A Memoir
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Neugeboren. Owl/Holt, $14.95. A novelist describes his
younger brother's 30-year battle with mental illness, and his own
struggle to navigate the nightmarish system of mistreatment and
inattentive care that dooms many victims of schizophrenia and
manic-depressive disorder. This is a ''powerful story,'' Frederick
Busch said in these pages in 1997. In Out of the Shadows:
Confronting America's Mental Illness Crisis, by E. Fuller Torrey
(Wiley, $16.95), a psychiatrist reports that millions of Americans
are suffering from severe mental illness without treatment. ''The
crisis he delineates should stir any halfway sensitive human being
to anger,'' Daniel J. Kevles wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Underground Man
</P>
<P>
   By Mick Jackson. Penguin, $12.95. This first novel focuses on
one of Victorian England's most famous eccentrics, the real-life
fifth Duke of Portland, who built an elaborate network of tunnels
beneath his lands to allow him hidden access to all parts of his
realm. ''Jackson has produced a marvelous study of human foibles,''
Erik Burns said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bear and His DaughTer: Stories
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Stone. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12. The novelist's
first collection of short fiction is populated by men who feel most
alive when they are angry. In evoking a kind of grinding male
arrest, ''Stone turns the scraps and figments of style that we call
characters into real people,'' James Wood wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Never Eat Your Heart Out
</P>
<P>
   By Judith Moore. North Point, $13. A California writer and
editor expresses her life story through the food she has prepared,
peppering her lively account with bite-sized essays on everything
from the history of the cranberry to the sex life of turkeys. Last
year our reviewer, Susan Cheever, called this a ''tart,
satisfying'' memoir.
</P>
<P>
   The Teachings of Don B.: Satires, Parodies, Fables, Illustrated
Stories, and Plays of Donald Barthelme
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Kim Herzinger. Vintage International, $15. Whether a
parody of Bret Easton Ellis or a shaggy dog story about a
4,000-pound Gouda cheese, the 63 pieces collected here bristle with
the author's delight in surprising the reader with his
genre-jumping acrobatics. The result is ''a small education in
laughter, melancholy and the English language,'' James Marcus wrote
here in 1992. A Dog's Head, by Jean Dutourd, translated by Robin
Chancellor (University of Chicago, $12), is a slender Barthelmesque
fantasy about a middle-class Frenchman born with the t te of a
spaniel. This satirical novel is ''sad-eyed, witty and often very
funny,'' C. J. Rolo wrote here in 1953.

`THE LAST RESORT': SCENES FROM A FALTERING MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basic ingredients of Alison Lurie's new novel ``The Last
Resort'' are the same as those she used in ``The War Between the
Tates,'' her classic 1974 portrait of a disintegrating marriage: an
eminent man, who is working on an important book; his once
worshipful helpmate of a wife; their two disappointing children;
the wife's best friend, who happens to be a bossy feminist, and a
bubble-headed young woman who has made herself the chief groupie of
the eminent man.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe used to put these ingredients together, however, has
undergone serious change, and not for the better. In renouncing her
gift for psychological insight and social detail, Ms. Lurie has
produced a thin, spindly novel, peopled not by flesh and blood
characters but by papery cartoons. Her wicked sense of humor, once
used to point up the absurdities of contemporary life, is now
employed solely at her characters' expense, just as her cool
omniscience has given way to a chilly, sardonic detachment.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Last Resort'' opens, we are introduced to the Walkers:
Wilkie, a famous naturalist (``perhaps the most famous popular
naturalist of his generation'') who is working on a biography of a
tree called ``The Copper Beech,'' and his much younger wife, Jenny,
who has devoted her adult life to helping Wilkie with his books.
</P>
<P>
   Something has happened recently to upset the Walkers' pleasant
routine. The 70-year old Wilkie has become convinced that he is
suffering from colon cancer, and he has also begun to despair about
his career. He feels that he has become a mere popularizer of
serious environmental issues, a has-been who has inspired a host of
``posturing, sentimental amateur naturalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jenny has no idea that Wilkie has decided to commit
suicide, she is concerned about his deepening depression and
proposes spending the winter in the vacation paradise of Key West.
</P>
<P>
   As things happen in novels like this, the change of scenery will
work all sorts of changes on the Walkers' life. Jenny takes a
part-time job for the first time in her life, becomes friends with
a feisty feminist named Lee Weiss and carries on flirtations with
both Lee and a self-dramatizing poet named Gerald Grass. As for
Wilkie, he meets an ardent fan named Barbie Mumpson, the plump,
unhappily married wife of a congressman, and he realizes that he
enjoys a devoted audience among Florida retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Will Wilkie be thwarted in his efforts to commit suicide or will
he think better of his plans to kill himself? Will his marriage to
Jenny break up? Will she become a feminist or take off with Lee or
Gerald? And what of Wilkie's book? Will it become the capstone of
his career or be abandoned as a sad, unfinished symbol of his
unraveling reputation?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are supposed to propel ``The Last Resort''
toward its conclusion, but the reader has an increasingly difficult
time caring what happens to any of Ms. Lurie's characters, who are
uniformly portrayed as dimwitted ninnies and jerks, unimaginative
stereotypes in the gender wars the author has been chronicling for
so many years. The men are male chauvinist pigs who want their
wives and girlfriends to wait on them night and day while the women
are either sniveling little creatures who hang on their husbands'
every word or noisy feminists, bitter and hostile toward men.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier novels like ``The War Between the Tates'' and
``Foreign Affairs,'' Ms. Lurie performed a delicate balancing act,
using her authorial omniscience to portray her characters'
tumultuous emotional lives from within, while at the same time
showing us the comical, self-deluding faces they present to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she has all but abandoned any effort to examine their
inner lives, and as a result they quickly devolve into brittle,
satiric pawns, pushed hither and thither like chess pieces by the
author's heavy hand.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkie emerges as a sour old coot, selfish, self-absorbed and
self-pitying. He's the sort of cutesy naturalist writer who sees
people as animals and plants. When he's thinking fondly of Jenny,
she seems like a ``transfigured human version of a salt marsh
mouse.'' When he's angry at her, she comes to resemble the common
garden shrew with a ``shrill little twittering voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Ms. Lurie's own characterization of Jenny is
equally cliched. In fact, Jenny comes across in this novel as a
sadly submissive sap; though it's the 1990s, she has spent her life
behaving like a parody of a '50s sitcom housewife, worrying about
how much of Wilkie's life ``was wasted on inessentials'' and
echoing his every thought.
</P>
<P>
   As Gerald the poet observes: ``A real wife. I thought they
didn't make them anymore. Classically beautifully, well-educated,
intelligent, fantastic gourmet cook. And besides that, she keeps
their accounts, drives the car, answers Wilkie's letters and does
all his research. And whatever he believes, she just naturally goes
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The social matrix the Walkers inhabit feels similarly cursory in
tone. Gone is the Updikean detail that made the lives of the Tates
and other characters so palpable in earlier novels; gone is the
complicated network of relationships that anchored her earlier
characters' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Lurie's prose is fluent as ever, the reader learns
almost nothing about the Walkers' life in New England, and their
experience in Key West is defined almost completely in terms of
predictable encounters with new acquaintances and friends, all of
them tired types, from colorful homosexuals and anxious retirees to
boorish tourists and smarmy panderers to the tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why ``The Last Resort'' even feels flimsy as a
physical object. In retrospect, its small pages and large type seem
indicative of the attenuation of the story itself.

   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-LAWN (Undated) _ ``The American Lawn: Surface of
Everyday Life,'' a corker of a show at the Canadian Center for
Architecture in Montreal (through Sept. 27), begins with a ride on
a lawn sprinkler. Back and forth the camera swings, scanning the
archetypal patch of grass, oscillating between peripheral glimpses
of equally iconic neighbors on either side: the no-nonsense lady
trimming her hedge to clipped perfection, the cool kids hanging out
by the garage. In the background, water hisses. The video is
projected onto the floor, and you hesitate to step on it. Your
shadow might block the projection. Thus the show stylishly connects
two kinds of transgression: one associated with land, the other
with museums. Keep Off. Don't Touch. By Herbert Muschamp. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GESHER-THEATER (Tel Aviv, Israel) _ Making theater in Israel
would seem a daunting task, what with a history more intense than
any drama, a potpourri of cultures that have resisted melding and a
life forever mired in crisis. Yet these are the very ingredients
that Yevgeny Arye has conjured to propel his Gesher Theater to a
predominant position in Israel in less than seven years, a troupe
that has received raves both inside the country and beyond. By
Serge Schemann. (Moved)
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Theater Reviews of ``Side Man''; ``You
Never Can Tell'' and ``Love's Fire.'' By Vincent Canby. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of films and their
suitability for children. This week: ``Dr. Dolittle``;
``Armageddon'' and ``Gone With the Wind.'' (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WILL-PATTON-FILM (Undated) _ For Will Patton, it's the end of
the world. Again. In the course of some 30 films, the actor has
endured post-apocalyptic mail carriers, squishy parasites from
outer space and the wrath of God, so this weekend's scourge _ an
asteroid the size of Texas, headed straight for Earth _ should be
no trouble. Patton is appearing in ``Armageddon,'' which stars
Bruce Willis and is the summer's second doomsday adventure movie.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN-BALLETS (Stuttgart, Germany) _ A tribute to John Cranko,
the deceased artistic director of the Stuttgart Ballet, starting
Tuesday at the Lincoln Center Festival '98; John Neumeier
celebrates his 25th anniversary as head of the Hamburg Ballet,
which will present ``Bernstein Dances'' at the festival. By Kate
Mattingly. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HILDEGARD-MUSIC (Undated) _ We should all be as lively and
robust in our 900th year as Hildegard of Bingen. Unless you've been
dwelling under a rock, the name of this 12th-century German abbess
should at least ring a bell by now. Though never canonized,
Hildegard has achieved an eccentric sort of sainthood, having been
adopted as an icon by partisans of such renegade causes as Creation
Spirituality and feminism. By Cori Ellison. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONIE-FANTASTIQUE (New York) _ Basil Twist's underwater
puppetry, currently at work in the Here theater complex in
Manhattan. Twist's exercise, called simply ``Symphonie
Fantastique,'' manipulates objects and light within a 500-gallon
tank of water, one side of which, 30 by 40 inches, is visible to an
audience of about 100. ``Symphonie,'' performed to an old
Philadelphia Orchestra recording led by Eugene Ormandy, has its
halting moments and flashes of extraordinary beauty. It plays until
July 26. By Bernard Holland. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-ALBUMS (Undated) _ On too many internationally released
albums by African stars, guest vocalists are enlisted to break the
language barrier; American or European producers tweak the rhythms
to sound more like funk or reggae or whatever else they think will
reach the unconverted. It sounds as if the international labels
that sought out African bands went on to second-guess themselves,
deciding that their African talent may know what plays to the folks
at home but needs help overseas. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KUSAMA-ART (Undated) _ What do you do with Yayoi Kusama? Art
historians, critics and even other artists have found it difficult
to classify the work of the Japanese-born artist, whose career
flourished in New York during the 1960s but whose art is not
exactly Pop, or Minimalist, or psychedelic, or Abstract
Expressionist. But as today's late-post-modern vantage point
reveals, Ms. Kusama's art shared affinities with or anticipated all
of these tendencies and others, too. By Edward M. Gomez. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DUTCH-ART (Washington) _ Dutch artists pursued subjects among
their immediate surroundings, painting Dutch men and women, their
everyday lives and the Dutch landscape. They gave genre painting
its first definition and painted so many depictions of objects that
the term ``stilleven'' _ still life _ was coined. Perhaps the most
vivid reflection of this worldliness _ this inclusive embrace of
knowledge, experience and beauty _ was the kunstkamer, or art
cabinet, the often encyclopedic arrays of art, artifacts and
natural specimens assembled by prosperous Dutch or Flemish
burghers. So argues ``A Collector's Cabinet,'' a pocket-size show
at the National Gallery of Art. By Roberta Smith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-DISABLED (Undated) _ The documentary on a disabled person
``If I Can't Do it,'' which has its premiere on the PBS series
``P.O.V.'' on Tuesday at 10 p.m., seems a stunningly appropriate
observance right after Independence Day. By Mary Johnson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-TIES (Undated) _ Considering the general flood of
television shows, it's startling to realize that at the height of
its popularity in the 1980s, ``Family Ties'' ranked as one of the
most-watched shows not just of the moment but in the history of
television. Watching four episodes just released on videocassette
by Columbia House, one might wonder why but there is no doubt how
well a top sitcom can serve its era before passing on. By Peter M.
Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WENTWORTH-WOODHOUSE-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ What is a country-house
auction without the house? The answer: a mirage of marketing. That
is the case with the sale on Wednesday at Christie's in London
dedicated to Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, the biggest house in
Britain. By Mitchell Owens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL (`t' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ITALY (Undated) _ Seeking out Deruta pottery at its
source, and finding modern twists on a centuries-old tradition. By
Elaine Sciolino. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-VIETNAM (Undated) _ Vietname offers hotel bargains as
tourism dwindles. By Philip Shenon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BARGAINS (Undated) _ Hot travel deals. By Janet Piorko.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Summer travel road warnings. By
Betsy Wade. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ European beaches get yearly report
card; A mini-Philadelphia at Morris Arboretum; Fame goes to her
head so Liberty clips access; New dialing system for Italian
telephones. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ South Africa garden route; The Concorde
on the cheap; Van Goghs tg Washington. By Paul Freireich. (Moved).

   SIERRA BLANCA, Texas _ Desolate but beautiful, the town of

   UNDATED _ Twenty million Americans stay at their jobs only to
retain health benefits. Yet research studies indicate that their
work has a good chance of making them sick. That is an interesting
observation discussed in ``Toxic Work: How to Overcome Stress,
Overload, and Burnout and Revitalize Your Career'' (The Penguin
Group, 245 pages, $12.95, paperback). By TERESA MCUSIC. Story has

<P>
   UNDATED _ Two Texans are having breakfast with
screenwriter-director Don Roos when Roos asks them to explain the
difference between Dallas and Fort Worth. One of the Texans is Lyle
Lovett, so it seems best to defer to him. Lovett, having just
polished off a plate of ``huevos rancheros,'' gives the standard
line: Fort Worth is old cattle culture, Dallas is new money. But
then, Lovett waxes nostalgic. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story will move in

<P>
   UNDATED _ You simply cannot comprehend the expression, ``fear
gripped me,'' until you have been truly terrified for minutes that
seem like hours. No, I have not been to war and crouched in a
foxhole as bullets whizzed overhead. I did drive through a rough
neighborhood in Amarillo late one night some years ago, but no one
was out except this old, gray cat with no tail and just three legs.
Nevertheless, I know fear. By MONICA FERAZIER ANDERSON. Story will

   UNDATED _ Several North Texas art museums are pitching
exhibitions as vicarious getaways this typically sizzling summer.
But none as explicitly as the Dallas Museum of Art, where curator
Eleanor Jones Harvey has placed a big picture of a snowy mountain

   THOMPSON-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ As a tireless believer in the value of America's
two-party political system, I must say it was encouraging to watch
Texas Democrats whoop it up at their convention in San Antonio last
weekend. With no regard at all for polls that show Democratic
candidates in big trouble, party loyalists staged a terrific pep
rally in the Alamodome. They lit up the Alamo City as if they had
something to celebrate. It is not entirely clear what previously
untapped source of unbridled optimism might have fueled the
delegates' enthusiasm. But here's a guess: Al Gore. By BILL
THOMPSON. Story will move in ``k'' commentary category. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Look at a map and you'll see the problem instantly: the
pint-size right triangle of land called Delaware looks like a
cartographic afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Its northern tip is embedded in Pennsylvania. The rest seems to
be a province of eastern Maryland, which itself resembles a
Rorschach blot between Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.
What's more, the southernmost sliver of the Eastern Shore turns out
to be part of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The whole peninsula is called Delmarva, a coinage as cluttered
as the acreage it was meant to unify. Why can't Delaware have the
rectangular boldness of, say, Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   All right, this is a quibble over a small place with multiple
personalities. Once you get 100 miles south of industrial
Wilmington, the name Du Pont vanishes from consciousness, and
Delaware, indeed, begins to look very much like Kansas,
unrelentingly rural and as flat as barn siding. But go east, and
the sameness of southern Delaware's farm country gives way to bay
and ocean beach with some of the most curvaceous sand dunes on the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   From Lewes (pronounced LOO-iss), a 360-year-old village of boat
builders and fishermen tucked into the crook of Cape Henlopen at
the mouth of Delaware Bay, to Rehoboth Beach and its sisters,
Bethany Beach, Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island, the compact 25-mile
ocean coastline makes a weekend excursion feel like a visit to
someone's rambling summer compound.
</P>
<P>
   Your host has left no one unprovided for: shopping and
sightseeing in historic Lewes, boardwalk amusements in Rehoboth
Beach and, in a state with no sales tax, three sprawling outlet
malls with 140 high-end retailers on Route 1, the main north-south
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ancient preserve of American Indian beachcombers, the
coast's harbors and inlets eventually lured pirates and other
plunderers (the Dutch and the British). The pirates, among them
Captain Kidd, were rumored to have buried their treasure onshore;
the Dutch and the British occasionally fired cannonballs at the
populace from the safety of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, the shore has always offered four-star avian
hospitality during the spring migration, when millions of
horseshoe-crab eggs make Delaware the prime layover for red knots
and other birds commuting between South American winter homes and
Arctic breeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But no invasion has been as enduring or as lucrative as the
invasion of the summer people, a tradition that dates to the 1870s,
when Rehoboth Beach, the hub of the Delaware shore, became a
Methodist campground. You can still find Methodists and
campgrounds, but mostly you will find families from the
mid-Atlantic states, the Capitol Hill crowd (Rehoboth, 125 miles
from Washington, has long billed itself as ``the nation's summer
capital'') and a share of the 20-somethings. They fill the low-rise
boardwalk hotels and the dignified Colonial and Cape Cod homes for
rent deep in the city's cool pine groves, a feature that
distinguishes Rehoboth Beach from the nearby New Jersey shore,
where shade usually comes from a beach umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware, the beaches are free (no tags, no fees) and summer
feels like a religious rite, with the beach as altar and the
parking meter a kind of collection plate.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down Rehoboth Avenue, the wide four-lane main street in
Rehoboth Beach, where earlier in the century vacationers arrived at
the mile-long boardwalk by steam locomotive, parking meters are the
most visible sign that summer is in session. The city implants the
meter heads about a week before Memorial Day and extracts them the
second Sunday after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gorged from continual daily feedings (10 a.m. to midnight), the
meters are a gold mine _ 4.4 million quarters last season, or $1.1
million in revenue. Much of it pays for a work force that grows
from 64 to 200 full-time employees _ from beach patrol to police
force to sanitation crew _ to serve a community that bulges to as
many as 50,000 in July and August. Year-round, the city has fewer
than 1,500 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   My 12-year-old son, Alec, and I decided to preview the season on
a recent weekend. We knew we'd have a 170-mile drive down the
Garden State Parkway to Cape May, but we were looking forward to a
leisurely ferry ride at the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-hour trip from northern New Jersey, we easily
spotted the blue and yellow signs for the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, a
five-boat fleet that began service in 1964 and now carries 1.5
million passengers annually.
</P>
<P>
   Each vessel can carry 1,000 passengers and 100 vehicles. In peak
season, a family of four in a car or van would pay $39.50 one way.
The 17-mile voyage across Delaware Bay to Lewes takes about 70
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Alec and I crossed on the Cape Henlopen, grazing in the snack
bar and picking over trinkets in the gift shop. The bay was calm _
we picked up a three-dolphin escort midway _ and the boat
eventually reached its cruising speed of about 16 knots.
</P>
<P>
   As we drew near Lewes, we caught sight of some of the
cylindrical watchtowers at the former Fort Miles, a warren of
concrete gun emplacements built by the Army in 1940 to guard the
bay against submarines preying on Allied oil tankers from
Wilmington and Philadelphia. German subs were sighted (one
surrendered in 1945), but ordnance from Fort Miles never engaged
one. Climb the 110 steps to the top of a tower, and you'll have a
panoramic view.
</P>
<P>
   The guns themselves are gone now, and the fort is part of Cape
Henlopen State Park, a pristine preserve of dunes, marshes, meadows
and woods threaded by nature trails and bike paths, just outside
Lewes, which is only a mile or so from the pier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We made our way to the Bay Moon Bed and Breakfast, which I had
picked out of a book called ``Recommended Bed and Breakfasts,
Mid-Atlantic States,'' by Suzi Forbes Gates (Globe Pequot Press,
1995).
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Moon, an 1887 Victorian home, had changed hands only
months before, but the transition must have been smooth. Our host,
Pam Rizzo, cooked up magnificent breakfasts, served wine, soda and
cheese at cocktail time and even provided a bored pre-teen-ager
with a selection of popular videos for viewing in our room. Alec
chose ``Dante's Peak,'' a volcanic romance.
</P>
<P>
   On our first full day, we toured Lewes, which calls itself the
first town in the first state (Delaware having been the first
colony to ratify the Constitution, in 1791). It was settled by
Dutchmen from the town of Hoorn who had come looking for whales in
the bay in 1631 but found that swans were more plentiful. Three
hundred years later, in 1931, the town dedicated a scaled-down copy
of Hoorn's city hall. It stands today near the center of town as
the Zwaanendael Museum, which means valley of the swans.
</P>
<P>
   A two-story exhibit center of local artifacts, history and lore,
the museum is a good way to get started. The story of a British
warship, HMS deBraak, is one of the highlights. Known to have
preyed on Spanish ships in the New World, the deBraak sank in a
squall off Cape Henlopen in 1787; treasure hunters speculated for
years about the wealth that might have been aboard. When the ship
was finally found and raised in the mid-1980s, there was no loot,
but there were thousands of artifacts from the period.
</P>
<P>
   More slapstick than drama is the brief story of another British
ship, the Poictiers (pronounced PAHS-tee-ay), that unfolds in a
delightful example of English epistolary understatement _ a framed
copy of a handwritten letter from a British naval commander to the
chief magistrate of Lewes during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   Dated March 16, 1813, the officer's letter says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you receive this, I request you will send 20 live
bullocks with a proportionate quantity of vegetables and hay to the
Poictiers for the use of Britannic Majesty's squadron now at this
anchorage, which will be immediately paid for at the Philadelphia
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you refuse to comply with this request I shall be under
necessity of destroying your town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the honor to be, sir, your very obedient servant,
</P>
<P>
   ``J.P. Beresford Commodore
</P>
<P>
   ``and commander of the British Squadron in the
</P>
<P>
   ``Mouth of the Delaware.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 6 and 7, having heard nothing from Lewes, the commodore
shelled the town, killing a chicken and wounding a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Alec and I found a cannonball from the Poictiers lodged in a
stone foundation of the Marine Museum on Front Street. But as Alec
pointed out, Beresford's gunners would have had no shot at the old
house now; their sights would be blocked by Cinnamon Falls Gourmet
Coffee and the House of Candles.
</P>
<P>
   The ineffectual cannonball is just a block north of the
graveyard at St. Peter's Episcopal Church, where such notables as
the deBraak's captain, James Drew, and four Delaware governors are
buried. There's also the inexplicably odd stone of Elizabeth H.
Cullen, born ``February 30th, 1760.''
</P>
<P>
   Before tourism, Lewes made its money turning huge catches of
menhaden into fertilizer. Now, shopping, dining and sport fishing
are its mainstay. And while there's a large beach at Lewes, the
more popular ones start about seven miles down the road at Rehoboth
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   After a day at the arcades or the rides at Funland on the
boardwalk, there is almost always an open-air concert. On our last
night on the shore, a kind of ``Ah, Wilderness!'' mood enveloped
the bandstand as this essentially old-fashioned summer town and
some young out-of-towners prepared to get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 7:30, and Bill Berresford, director of the
Mansfield, Pa., High School Band (and no relation to the old
commodore), was fixing a sticky saxophone valve for a nervous
teen-age musician while 80 of her colleagues, warming up, shifted
in metal folding chairs on the bandstand and tootled chaotically.
</P>
<P>
   Above them, stars were already popping into view. Facing them,
about 200 yards away, was the churning Atlantic. Directly in front
of them, on white wooden benches, random strollers gradually took
the form of an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Berresford, the director's wife and also a music teacher,
explained that the band takes a two-day trip at the close of the
school year, sometimes venturing to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia to
play the national anthem for the Pirates or the Phillies. Every
four years, the band goes to Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach for
concerts and some well-earned relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these kids are from farm country,'' Mrs. Berresford
said. ``It took us seven hours to get here, and many of them have
never seen the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   When the concert ended at 9 o'clock, the band got a standing
ovation. The next morning, squinting into the hazy sun after a late
night of beach food, 80 young people from north-central
Pennsylvania put their blankets on the sand and walked toward the
surf.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Look at a map and you'll see the problem instantly: the
pint-size right triangle of land called Delaware looks like a
cartographic afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Its northern tip is embedded in Pennsylvania. The rest seems to
be a province of eastern Maryland, which itself resembles a
Rorschach blot between Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.
What's more, the southernmost sliver of the Eastern Shore turns out
to be part of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The whole peninsula is called Delmarva, a coinage as cluttered
as the acreage it was meant to unify. Why can't Delaware have the
rectangular boldness of, say, Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   All right, this is a quibble over a small place with multiple
personalities. Once you get 100 miles south of industrial
Wilmington, the name Du Pont vanishes from consciousness, and
Delaware, indeed, begins to look very much like Kansas,
unrelentingly rural and as flat as barn siding. But go east, and
the sameness of southern Delaware's farm country gives way to bay
and ocean beach with some of the most curvaceous sand dunes on the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   From Lewes (pronounced LOO-iss), a 360-year-old village of boat
builders and fishermen tucked into the crook of Cape Henlopen at
the mouth of Delaware Bay, to Rehoboth Beach and its sisters,
Bethany Beach, Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island, the compact 25-mile
ocean coastline makes a weekend excursion feel like a visit to
someone's rambling summer compound.
</P>
<P>
   Your host has left no one unprovided for: shopping and
sightseeing in historic Lewes, boardwalk amusements in Rehoboth
Beach and, in a state with no sales tax, three sprawling outlet
malls with 140 high-end retailers on Route 1, the main north-south
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ancient preserve of American Indian beachcombers, the
coast's harbors and inlets eventually lured pirates and other
plunderers (the Dutch and the British). The pirates, among them
Captain Kidd, were rumored to have buried their treasure onshore;
the Dutch and the British occasionally fired cannonballs at the
populace from the safety of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, the shore has always offered four-star avian
hospitality during the spring migration, when millions of
horseshoe-crab eggs make Delaware the prime layover for red knots
and other birds commuting between South American winter homes and
Arctic breeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But no invasion has been as enduring or as lucrative as the
invasion of the summer people, a tradition that dates to the 1870s,
when Rehoboth Beach, the hub of the Delaware shore, became a
Methodist campground. You can still find Methodists and
campgrounds, but mostly you will find families from the
mid-Atlantic states, the Capitol Hill crowd (Rehoboth, 125 miles
from Washington, has long billed itself as ``the nation's summer
capital'') and a share of the 20-somethings. They fill the low-rise
boardwalk hotels and the dignified Colonial and Cape Cod homes for
rent deep in the city's cool pine groves, a feature that
distinguishes Rehoboth Beach from the nearby New Jersey shore,
where shade usually comes from a beach umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware, the beaches are free (no tags, no fees) and summer
feels like a religious rite, with the beach as altar and the
parking meter a kind of collection plate.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down Rehoboth Avenue, the wide four-lane main street in
Rehoboth Beach, where earlier in the century vacationers arrived at
the mile-long boardwalk by steam locomotive, parking meters are the
most visible sign that summer is in session. The city implants the
meter heads about a week before Memorial Day and extracts them the
second Sunday after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gorged from continual daily feedings (10 a.m. to midnight), the
meters are a gold mine _ 4.4 million quarters last season, or $1.1
million in revenue. Much of it pays for a work force that grows
from 64 to 200 full-time employees _ from beach patrol to police
force to sanitation crew _ to serve a community that bulges to as
many as 50,000 in July and August. Year-round, the city has fewer
than 1,500 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   My 12-year-old son, Alec, and I decided to preview the season on
a recent weekend. We knew we'd have a 170-mile drive down the
Garden State Parkway to Cape May, but we were looking forward to a
leisurely ferry ride at the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-hour trip from northern New Jersey, we easily
spotted the blue and yellow signs for the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, a
five-boat fleet that began service in 1964 and now carries 1.5
million passengers annually.
</P>
<P>
   Each vessel can carry 1,000 passengers and 100 vehicles. In peak
season, a family of four in a car or van would pay $39.50 one way.
The 17-mile voyage across Delaware Bay to Lewes takes about 70
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Alec and I crossed on the Cape Henlopen, grazing in the snack
bar and picking over trinkets in the gift shop. The bay was calm _
we picked up a three-dolphin escort midway _ and the boat
eventually reached its cruising speed of about 16 knots.
</P>
<P>
   As we drew near Lewes, we caught sight of some of the
cylindrical watchtowers at the former Fort Miles, a warren of
concrete gun emplacements built by the Army in 1940 to guard the
bay against submarines preying on Allied oil tankers from
Wilmington and Philadelphia. German subs were sighted (one
surrendered in 1945), but ordnance from Fort Miles never engaged
one. Climb the 110 steps to the top of a tower, and you'll have a
panoramic view.
</P>
<P>
   The guns themselves are gone now, and the fort is part of Cape
Henlopen State Park, a pristine preserve of dunes, marshes, meadows
and woods threaded by nature trails and bike paths, just outside
Lewes, which is only a mile or so from the pier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We made our way to the Bay Moon Bed and Breakfast, which I had
picked out of a book called ``Recommended Bed and Breakfasts,
Mid-Atlantic States,'' by Suzi Forbes Gates (Globe Pequot Press,
1995).
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Moon, an 1887 Victorian home, had changed hands only
months before, but the transition must have been smooth. Our host,
Pam Rizzo, cooked up magnificent breakfasts, served wine, soda and
cheese at cocktail time and even provided a bored pre-teen-ager
with a selection of popular videos for viewing in our room. Alec
chose ``Dante's Peak,'' a volcanic romance.
</P>
<P>
   On our first full day, we toured Lewes, which calls itself the
first town in the first state (Delaware having been the first
colony to ratify the Constitution, in 1791). It was settled by
Dutchmen from the town of Hoorn who had come looking for whales in
the bay in 1631 but found that swans were more plentiful. Three
hundred years later, in 1931, the town dedicated a scaled-down copy
of Hoorn's city hall. It stands today near the center of town as
the Zwaanendael Museum, which means valley of the swans.
</P>
<P>
   A two-story exhibit center of local artifacts, history and lore,
the museum is a good way to get started. The story of a British
warship, HMS deBraak, is one of the highlights. Known to have
preyed on Spanish ships in the New World, the deBraak sank in a
squall off Cape Henlopen in 1787; treasure hunters speculated for
years about the wealth that might have been aboard. When the ship
was finally found and raised in the mid-1980s, there was no loot,
but there were thousands of artifacts from the period.
</P>
<P>
   More slapstick than drama is the brief story of another British
ship, the Poictiers (pronounced PAHS-tee-ay), that unfolds in a
delightful example of English epistolary understatement _ a framed
copy of a handwritten letter from a British naval commander to the
chief magistrate of Lewes during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   Dated March 16, 1813, the officer's letter says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you receive this, I request you will send 20 live
bullocks with a proportionate quantity of vegetables and hay to the
Poictiers for the use of Britannic Majesty's squadron now at this
anchorage, which will be immediately paid for at the Philadelphia
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you refuse to comply with this request I shall be under
necessity of destroying your town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the honor to be, sir, your very obedient servant,
</P>
<P>
   ``J.P. Beresford Commodore
</P>
<P>
   ``and commander of the British Squadron in the
</P>
<P>
   ``Mouth of the Delaware.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 6 and 7, having heard nothing from Lewes, the commodore
shelled the town, killing a chicken and wounding a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Alec and I found a cannonball from the Poictiers lodged in a
stone foundation of the Marine Museum on Front Street. But as Alec
pointed out, Beresford's gunners would have had no shot at the old
house now; their sights would be blocked by Cinnamon Falls Gourmet
Coffee and the House of Candles.
</P>
<P>
   The ineffectual cannonball is just a block north of the
graveyard at St. Peter's Episcopal Church, where such notables as
the deBraak's captain, James Drew, and four Delaware governors are
buried. There's also the inexplicably odd stone of Elizabeth H.
Cullen, born ``February 30th, 1760.''
</P>
<P>
   Before tourism, Lewes made its money turning huge catches of
menhaden into fertilizer. Now, shopping, dining and sport fishing
are its mainstay. And while there's a large beach at Lewes, the
more popular ones start about seven miles down the road at Rehoboth
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   After a day at the arcades or the rides at Funland on the
boardwalk, there is almost always an open-air concert. On our last
night on the shore, a kind of ``Ah, Wilderness!'' mood enveloped
the bandstand as this essentially old-fashioned summer town and
some young out-of-towners prepared to get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 7:30, and Bill Berresford, director of the
Mansfield, Pa., High School Band (and no relation to the old
commodore), was fixing a sticky saxophone valve for a nervous
teen-age musician while 80 of her colleagues, warming up, shifted
in metal folding chairs on the bandstand and tootled chaotically.
</P>
<P>
   Above them, stars were already popping into view. Facing them,
about 200 yards away, was the churning Atlantic. Directly in front
of them, on white wooden benches, random strollers gradually took
the form of an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Berresford, the director's wife and also a music teacher,
explained that the band takes a two-day trip at the close of the
school year, sometimes venturing to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia to
play the national anthem for the Pirates or the Phillies. Every
four years, the band goes to Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach for
concerts and some well-earned relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these kids are from farm country,'' Mrs. Berresford
said. ``It took us seven hours to get here, and many of them have
never seen the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   When the concert ended at 9 o'clock, the band got a standing
ovation. The next morning, squinting into the hazy sun after a late
night of beach food, 80 young people from north-central
Pennsylvania put their blankets on the sand and walked toward the
surf.

<P>
   INSIDE THE BUBBLE, China _ ``Leak to me, too, Barry,'' a
correspondent hollers at a White House aide who is whispering to
her colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the room looks up.
</P>
<P>
   Did they miss something?
</P>
<P>
   No, deputy press secretary Barry Toiv assures everyone. ``Just
answering a question,'' Toiv says. ``If you'd asked the same
question, we'd give you the same answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene is the ``bubble'' _ known officially as the traveling
White House press filing center. This is the movable fount of
knowledge where 250 of the world's most proficient, most exhausted
journalists are forced by the iron laws of deadlines to get most of
their first-hand China impressions.
</P>
<P>
   As we tap this story on our laptop, it is mid-afternoon in
Shanghai. This is the delightful daily interlude when editors back
home, a half day behind us, are sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50 of the 200 chairs in the filing center are
occupied. Even so, everyone is watching out of the corner of their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If a competitor picks up a valuable tidbit from the strolling
White House assistant, who knows if it could lead to a dreaded
``callback'' from an editor?
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate traveling cocoon _ the hermetically sealed
vantage point where we and most of the others in the traveling
Clinton press entourage have been forced to remain most of the time
during Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a week, the traveling press will have
``seen'' Clinton carry off about 39 White House-planned ``public
events'' including about 19 speeches, press conferences,
round-tables and ``brief remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   But by Day Eight of his nine-day trip to China, neither of us
had actually laid eyes on the president in person, except once
during the dramatic welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Because of filing deadlines, we had to give back to the press
office the credentials that would have allowed us to witness two of
the most important events of the trip: Clinton's joint press
conference with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing's Great Hall of
the People and his speech at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like other correspondents on the Clinton entourage,
we've had to file a patchwork of partial, much too America-centric
first impressions.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hard news'' that tops most of our stories has been largely
founded on the raw TV images and sound ``feeds'' that are piped
into the press room. Whatever instant perspective we add is pulled
from our memories, the databases in our laptops, what we can glean
from the ``play'' of the story on Chinese TV. Only on two of the
eight days have we been able to escape from the ``bubble'' to talk
with ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the Chinese followed us around, or that the White
House cooped us up against our will.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's that during presidential travels, the White House press
room is an information node of such a high-speed, high-volume
``throughput'' that is the only place where correspondents can hope
to stay up with the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents complain about ``bubble fever.'' But once a
presidential trip begins, few have time to escape from the
``bubble'' long enough develop a story that the presidential press
office hasn't put in the ``bible.'' This is the detailed,
semi-secret press schedule for traveling journalists that is marked
``not for release or publication.'' (For China, the ``bible'' came
in two parts, the first 89 pages long, the second 38 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of limits on press access _ imposed by the Chinese, or
the White House, or both _ most all the stops on the president's
daily rounds in China are so-called ``pooled events.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the 200 traveling journalists take turns getting
``pool'' credentials to witness what actually happens. Then they
turn over ``pool reports'' consisting of video footage, radio feeds
or typed-up notes to their colleagues. The White House press office
doesn't censor the content, but it is responsible for disseminating
the results.
</P>
<P>
   While the few journalists with the ``pool passes'' are
``prepositioned'' to await the president's arrival, the rest of the
press corps waits in the press room, until a photocopied ``pool
report'' is passed round the room by a low-level White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the fabled efficiency of the White House
Communications Agency, the press filing center is also the place
where White House correspondents can ``see'' or ``hear''
presidential events as they unfold, without even leaving their
laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Sound ``feeds'' from each of the half-dozen presidential
appearances each day are piped into the press room instantaneously,
often accompanied by live TV images.
</P>
<P>
   About half an hour after the president finishes talking, a White
House aide will come around the filing center and deposit a neatly
typed transcript cranked out by the traveling White House steno
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way every city's traffic gets paralyzed during an
American president's visit, the press room is also about the only
place where a correspondent can soak up what's going on, write it,
and not miss deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   For a news organization accredited to cover the White House
regularly, it will probably cost about $20,000 per correspondent to
cover Clinton's China trip.
</P>
<P>
   About half of this is the pro-rata share of the $1.1 million
that the White House travel office is paying to charter from Cathay
Pacific Airlines the Boeing 777-300 stretch jet that serves as the
traveling press plane. The balance is hotel bills, the charges for
the international direct-dial phones arranged by ATT, and the cost
of the round-the-clock filing center buffet.
</P>
<P>
   We started this piece in Shanghai, when the center of the bubble
was perched for three days on the fourth floor of Shanghai's
Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   We had to put this aside to write deadline stories. By the time
we could get back to it, the bubble had decamped 800 miles south to
the ballroom of the Gui Shan Hotel in Guilin, China.
</P>
<P>
   Unless exhaustion interferes, we'll file this in an hour by our
laptop's modem in the Guilin press center, using a Chinese long
distance phone line to hitch into a dialup modem in Hong Kong,
Beijing or Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   By the time our editors wake up and start editing this, the
bubble will have taken off once more and alighted once again. This
time, it will be the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Hong Kong, where we'll
hope to find a pool report telling us what Clinton was up to while
we were flying from Guilin to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the bubble moves, the remarkable thing is how
similarly laid out and superbly efficient is the transmission
paraphernalia. Everything has been pre-set for us by White House
and United States Information Agency advance teams before our
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In the front left corner of most every filing center, two
technicians from the White House Communications Agency (WACA) sit
behind a sound console that has been removed from a large blue
steamer trunk. It's WACA's job to transmit a sound ``feed'' of
every public word uttered by the president to those in the bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the door of every filing center is the non-stop
buffet. It is so ample, so varied, and so quick that few people
ever bother to leave the bubble to eat at real Chinese restaurants.
There are no checks to sign _ the cost will eventually get
pro-rated to the various news organizations by the White House
travel office. That, at least, is the theory.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Guilin, the buffet features a huge side of American
roast beef, along with tofu and mushrooms, stir-fried broccoli some
remarkably good Chinese steamed dumplings. For the faint-hearted,
there is a heaping platter of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
on white bread with the crusts removed.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House well knows, correspondents have families, and
families expect trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   As we were starting this story in Shanghai yesterday, a White
House aide bustled to the front of the filing center. ``White House
press shopping tour leaving,'' the aide called out. ``Meet at the
transportation desk on this floor at 1 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the Huai Ha Zhong Lu market press tour, a chance
for journalists to escape from ``the bubble'' for a few hours
before Press Secretary Mike McCurry's afternoon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearls, silks, fans, Chinese art,'' read the notation on the
White House signup sheet. About a dozen journalists and technicians
rose from their overworked laptops and made a bee-line for the
chartered buses.
</P>
<P>
   We skipped shopping so that we could get ready for something
really important: today's river boat cruise that the White House
press office has laid on to let correspondents experience the
mythic Li River, said to be the most beautiful spot in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will cruise the beautiful Li an a red, white and blue
river boat called The Panorama an hour or so ahead of the press
boat. If it is mythically beautiful enough for the First Traveler,
it is good enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, dear reader, this is the end of the story. Someone from
the White House staff has dropped a photocopied sheet on our desks
in the bubble.
</P>
<P>
   It says: ``NEW TIME: Press Bus Ride. Board Bus Here 1:30 P.M.
Buses Gone 1:45 p.m.'' This one we are not going to miss.

said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.

 &HT;    CAN LIBERTARIANS CREATE A MASS MOVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALITY?
 &HT;    730&AMP;add
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Back in the 1980 political campaign, a lot of folks
figured the Libertarians had some ``nutty ideas,'' recalled Steve
Dasbach, the party's national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the Libertarians were talking about privatizing Social
Security to give individual Americans control over their retirement
accounts. They wanted to use vouchers and home schooling to give
parents more educational choices for their children. And they were
for abolishing the income tax and reducing the role of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Libertarians gather in the nation's capital for
their 1998 ``Road to Victory'' convention, those ``crazy'' notions
are being earnestly debated in Congress and across the country,
said Dasbach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans and Democrats aren't adopting our ideas. They're
stealing them,'' lamented Charles Schoonover, who drew 2 percent of
the vote as a 1992 Libertarian congressional candidate in South
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Libertarians believe they are the emerging political
party for this era of an unregulatable Internet, a cynical
Generation X and a growing suspicion _ if not scorn _ for
government.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that much of the Libertarian philosophy of
less government, lower taxes and more personal freedom has become
part of mainstream political thought in the past decade, agreed
Steven Hess, a political analyst with the Brookings Institution, a
liberal research center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean they're about to become a 'third party,'
as opposed to a 'minor party','' Hess said. Instead, ``they're part
of a long, distinguished tradition of ideological minor parties''
whose ideas were absorbed by one or the other or both of the two
major parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``many ideas of the Socialists of Norman Thomas
were adopted during the New Deal period,'' said Hess.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges the Libertarians are confronting at their
national convention is how to convert their popular ideas into a
viable political force. About 750 activists, including delegates
from all 50 states, are attending the four-day meeting, which ends
Sunday. The party has about 28,000 dues-paying members nationwide
and is aiming for 100,000 by its presidential nominating convention
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   However, many Libertarians are running for local and state
offices this fall, and much of the convention focuses on those
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The party must win the votes of people who agree with their
philosophy but who ``are hanging back, waiting to make sure we
really do have a chance to win,'' said Frank Longo, a computer
systems manager and Libertarian activist from Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poll after poll shows Americans are frustrated with the tired
old choices offered by Democrats and Republicans,'' said Dasbach, a
chemistry and math instructor at Lutheran College in Fort Wayne,
Ind. ``But it's not enough to want an alternative. We have to build
an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   In places where they have candidates on the ballot, the
Libertarians do, indeed, offer an alternative philosophy _ one
based on the notions of maximizing personal freedom for individuals
and minimizing reliance on government.
</P>
<P>
   While they might agree with Republicans on tax cuts and school
choice, for instance, Libertarians differ by wanting to end the
federal war on drugs. Libertarians don't want the government
restrict gun ownership rights, or ban abortions, or probibit flag
burning, or censor the Internet. They favor campaign finance reform
and oppose farm subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's range of speakers illustrated the breadth of
Libertarian thought. Those scheduled to address the convention
include Atlanta talk radio host Neal Boortz; Amy and Dan Gifford,
producers of the videotape documentary ``Waco: The Rules of
Engagement;'' Roy Ennis, president of the civil rights group CORE;
Social scientist Charles Murray, and Walker Chandler, a Georgia
lawyer who represented himself in a landmark case in which the
Supreme Court struck down a state law requiring political
candidates to take drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republican Party believed in the principles they say
they believe in, we would not be necessary,'' said Michael Cloud, a
Libertarian candidate for the U.S. Senate in Nevada. ``If the
Democratic Party lived the civil liberties they claim to live, we
would not be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But the major parties ``are all rhetoric'' in regards to
adopting Libertarian ideas, said Anthony Trauring, a Georgia
delegate from Decatur. ``Their performances show that they're just
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   In states such as Texas _ home of Ron Paul, the 1988 Libertarian
presidential candidate who is now a Republican member of the U.S.
House _ the party has candidates on ballots throughout the state.
However, ``ballot access'' is still a key issue in Florida, the
delegates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to get on the ballot in Russia than in Florida,''
complained Richard Shepherd, a delegate from Juno Isles, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegates expressed disappointment in the lack of
change since the Republicans took over Congress in 1994. If House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., had been advising Rosa Parks, Cloud
said, the civil rights legend would have moved up from the back of
the bus at the rate of one row per year, while Gingrich kept making
the bus longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to add a word to the vocabulary of politicians _
'now','' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut and Michelle Forren, a couple from Duluth, were among the
Georgia delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been Libertarians all our lives _ only we just realized
it a few years ago,'' said Helmut.

 &HT;    GINGRICH, FIGHTING TO KEEP MAJORITY, STUMPS IN KENTUCKY
 &HT;    430&AMP;add. Not for Atlanta.
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich visited this
Democratic-leaning city Thursday to boost a Republican colleague
whose re-election is critical to Gingrich's hold on his job.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich helped raise money for freshman Rep. Anne Northup, who
won her seat by the slim margin of 1,299 votes as President Clinton
carried the district in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $700,000 campaign bank account, she expects a stiff
challenge from Chris Gorman, a conservative Democrat and former
state attorney general who has tried to tie Northup to Gingrich and
``extremist'' Republican policies.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have an 11-seat edge in the House, and Democrats
think Northup's seat is one they can recapture.
</P>
<P>
   On the last leg of a week-long campaign swing before returning
to Georgia for the Independence Day holiday, Gingrich continued to
mix an effort to expand Republican influence among minorities with
pointed political attacks on Democrats, their allies and
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Northup visited the summer camp and community
center of a predominantly black church that is seeking federal
funds to renovate an old building.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he spoke to more than 400 Northup contributors, including
United Parcel Service chairman Oz Nelson, whose Atlanta-based
company has a large facility in Louisville. The luncheon crowd paid
between $100 and $1,000 a person for sandwiches and chips.
</P>
<P>
   They heard Gingrich toss darts at some favorite targets:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About Clinton's responsibility for an increase in drug use,
Gingrich said, ``If you have no moral authority, young people don't
believe you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Trial lawyers are very dangerous, frankly, to the core
fabric of society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``If we don't get the surplus out of Washington, Al Gore and
Teddy Kennedy will find a way to spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his address, the speaker related an imaginary
conversation between two public housing residents concerning their
reaction to welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people think we should go to work. Have you thought
about going to work?'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shifting to the other person, he continued, ``No, it never
actually occurred to me. What do you think it would be like to go
to work? They say you get paid. You actually get money you can take
home and spend without a bureaucrat telling you what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Northup refused help from Gingrich in 1996, fearing the
unpopular speaker would hurt her bid. But Gingrich's poll numbers
have improved since then.
</P>
<P>
   And Northup said she plans to campaign on her ability to get
things done in a Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to campaigning with GOP candidates, Gingrich has
given generously from his ample campaign funds and hosted
fund-raisers for the Republican congressional committee, including
a Silicon Valley event with computer executives this week.
</P>
<P>
   His political action committee, the Monday Morning PAC, gave
$72,000 to GOP candidates in May alone, according to its most
recent report to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also has helped Republicans who don't have serious
opposition add to their campaign accounts so that they can
contribute to imperiled colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   One such fund-raiser that took place Wednesday in Texas
illustrated the delicate nature of trying to expand Republican
support while preserving the party's base at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   After addressing the convention of a Hispanic civil rights group
that has been at odds with the GOP-led Congress, Gingrich moved on
to a fund-raising reception and dinner for Rep. Joe Barton,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, who is expected to coast to re-election, was the leader
of a failed effort in May to keep legal immigrants from receiving
food stamps. Hispanics fiercely opposed the move and criticized
Gingrich as well for not stopping it.

STARR MAY BRING LEWINSKY BEFORE GRAND JURY IN VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For weekend release)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For nearly six months, Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr has marshaled more than 50 witnesses before a grand jury
here.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has another, lesser-known panel across the Potomac
River in Alexandria, Va., which he set up at the same time that he
created the one in the District of Columbia. And it is there, in
Virginia, where some legal experts predict he will bring charges in
the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   These experts point to Starr's recent leasing of 5,800 square
feet of office space in Alexandria _ across the street from the
federal courthouse where the second grand jury meets _ as evidence
that he is planning to move his investigation across the river.
</P>
<P>
   The space nearly equals the area that Starr's operation uses in
Washington. He has not given any details on how the new space will
be used.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say he may want to bring charges against Lewinsky
there simply because prosecutors win more often in Northern
Virginia than they do in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, defendants in federal court are twice as likely to be
acquitted by a jury in Washington than in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University
who has defended clients in both jurisdictions, says juries and
judges in Northern Virginia tend to be more conservative than in
the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Virginia district ``has long been the favored court
room for prosecutors,'' Turley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts cite additional factors drawing prosecutors
to Virginia: faster trials, juries that tend to follow the letter
of the law and judges that usually rule in favor of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia is possibly the worst jurisdiction that Ms. Lewinsky
could face in a case of this kind,'' Turley says.
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Barrett, a law professor at St. John's University in New
York City, says the 11 counties and cities that make up the
Northern Virginia district have a population that tends to be tough
on defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what's in that area: the Pentagon, retired military
personnel and a number of government security agencies,'' says
Barrett, a former associate independent counsel. ``The people who
work there and their families hold law and order in the highest
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Lewinsky, the former White House intern who
denied under oath that she had an affair with President Clinton,
that attitude could lead a grand jury to take any perjury charges
against her more seriously than a jury in Washington, Turley says.
</P>
<P>
   A perjury conviction in federal court carries a mandatory
sentence of 8 to 12 months in prison unless the prosecutor asks for
leniency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Starr has the evidence, they'll look at the law and say,
`Regardless of the circumstances, what she did was illegal and,
therefore, she's guilty,''' he says. He adds that Washington juries
have a reputation for looking at the events surrounding the case
and then deciding whether the law should apply.
</P>
<P>
   Washington jurors also have a reputation for distrusting the
motives of government prosecutors, particularly in high-profile
cases, according to Peter Kostopulos, a former federal prosecutor
who has tried cases in both Washington and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``During trials, minority jurors, which usually make up the
majority in Washington juries, tend to be more susceptible to
arguments that the government is trying to railroad a defendant
into jail,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude, Kostopulos says, means Washington juries tend to
be more sympathetic to defendants than Virginia juries.
</P>
<P>
   Kostopulos cites the case against Washington Mayor Marion Barry
in 1990. Despite being videotaped in a hotel room smoking crack
with a woman he thought was a prostitute, Barry was convicted only
on a misdemeanor possession charge and served six months in prison.
He later won back the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Although having two grand juries investigating the same case is
unusual, Starr is within his rights if he brings charges against
Lewinsky in Virginia rather than Washington, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett says that if Lewinsky lied about her relationship with
Clinton, she probably lied about it in both Virginia and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, the woman who secretly
tape-recorded their conversations about the alleged presidential
affair, worked at the Pentagon in Virginia. And a number of the
recordings between the two apparently took place in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the FBI and attorneys for the independent counsel
confronted Lewinsky about the allegations, they did it at the
Pentagon City shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett says a Starr indictment in Alexandria would be ``very
difficult to challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Nathaniel Speights, a lawyer for Lewinsky, says
attorneys for the independent counsel have assured him that the
Alexandria grand jury is only being used for the investigation into
the Pentagon's release of confidential information about Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the (office of the independent counsel) has been
confronted with the issue, we have been assured that there will not
be any type of illegal, unconstitutional forum shopping,'' he says.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he may be safe legally, Starr can be sure that any attempt
to move the case to Virginia would be challenged politically.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supporters would be expected to point out that
Washington's population is 66 percent black, while the Alexandria
jurisdiction is 81 percent white. So any decision by Starr to move
his investigation to Virginia would expose him to accusations that
he doesn't trust a black jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a public relations disaster,'' says Robert F.
Drinan, a law professor at Georgetown University specializing in
civil rights and race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main players in this case are all white, several
key supporting actors are African American, including Clinton
friend Vernon Jordan and White House Secretary Betty Currie, both
of whom have been questioned about the help they provided Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Washington voters also heavily supported Clinton in his 1996
re-election _ the president received 85 percent of the vote _ while
half the voters in the Alexandria jurisdiction backed Clinton. In
addition, in an April Gallup Poll, more than 90 percent of African
Americans _ compared with 60 percent of whites _ said they believed
investigations into the allegations involving Clinton should ``stop
now.''

WHY VIDEO SHELVES EMPTY FASTER  
 NEW VIDEO RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old question of why you often can't find what you want in a
video store has taken on interesting ramifications because of new
ways that movie studios are doing business with video stores.
</P>
<P>
   Studios used to sell videos to stores for a set price up front,
with retailers keeping all revenues from rental transactions. Now
studios frequently offer big chains like Blockbuster a price break
on new releases in return for a share of each rental transaction.
And though they also offer small, independent stores such
revenue-sharing plans, the arrangements aren't as favorable as they
are for the chains, which do a higher volume of business.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, smaller retailers and distributors say, is that big
stores use the price breaks to stock more copies of big hits,
gradually squeezing out wider inventories of older and specialized
films sought by many movie buffs. At the same time, the small
retailers say, they have to use more of their money to buy the big
hits, leaving them with fewer resources to buy other titles of
interest to a particular local clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Increased supplies of big hits certainly please the movie renter
who pounds up to the counter on a Friday night _ only to learn that
all 40 copies of ``Scream 2,'' say, are out for the weekend. But,
in the view of many independent video dealers, the stocking of more
cassettes of a few movies conditions the customer to want and
expect nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   And worse, they say, it discourages customers from browsing for
alternative choices, an activity that small stores count on for a
large part of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios are pushing video stores away from carrying broad
selections,'' said Russ Ward, owner of Video City U.S.A., an
independent store in Glendale Heights, Ill., about 20 miles west of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But studios say they are simply giving customers what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out what's going
on,'' said Steve Feldstein, vice president of corporate
communications at Fox Home Video.. ``We put together a program to
satisfy consumer demand for new titles.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Karen Raskopf, Blockbuster's vice president for
corporate communications, acknowledged that the company was
acquiring deeper supplies of the latest hits, she strongly disputed
the contention that the policies discouraged range and choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're driven by what the consumer wants,'' Ms. Raskopf said.
``In most cases, what they're talking about is new releases.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that this year Blockbuster has increased the numbers of
its copies of new titles by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not just big box office,'' she said. ``I'm also
talking about B titles.'' Blockbuster, she said, has also doubled
the number of smaller and lesser-known movies on its new-release
wall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the chain is working to fit inventories
to the demographics of individual areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a kids' store, we add that to the mix,'' she said.
`'Same thing with classics or foreign films. We buy on a
store-by-store basis to make sure we have the mix right.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Ward, the independent store owner, that's the kind of
thing the neighborhood store does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blockbuster and other chains have a hard time with this
because they're like McDonald's,'' he said. ``The old video store
is run by people who are part of the community and understand what
it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward made his case against the new arrangements in a recent
article in Video Business magazine, and elaborated in an interview.
Consumers want to see hits, he said, but how many are there in any
one week?
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the first week of July,'' he said. ``There's `Palmetto.'
Ever hear of that one?'' Reviews were mixed, and theater stays
short for Volker Schlondorff's convoluted and overly steamy film
noir, starring Elisabeth Shue and Woody Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Will Hunting'' will also be available next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great title,'' Ward said. ``But that's what you've
got for the week. If people want to rent only what's new, are they
only going to rent `Good Will Hunting'?''

   Good Will Hunting
</P>
<P>
   Pushing a janitor's broom at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, young Will Hunting (Matt Damon, left) pauses to doodle
a few equations on a hallway blackboard, thereby establishing
himself as a mathematical prodigy. But Will is frightened of his
gifts and is hiding out amid a circle of working-class friends, one
of them portrayed by Ben Affleck, who wrote the screenplay with
Damon for Gus Van Sant's film. Psychiatrists get nowhere with Will
until the case goes to Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a middle-aged
counselor with many of the same problems. Together, the two make a
bumpy go of it in a film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
directed with ``style, shrewdness and clarity.'' 1997. Miramax.
$107.37. Laser disk, $49.99. 126 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Boxer
</P>
<P>
   Once a firebrand for the Irish Republican Army, boxer Danny
Flynn (Daniel Day-Lewis) withstood 14 years in prison without
betraying his comrades. Released in Belfast, he tries to build a
life free of extremes and starts a gym that encourages a healthier
brand of competition between Catholics and Protestants. But old
hatreds boil when he renews a romance with a woman (Emily Watson)
who is now the wife of an imprisoned IRA member, and the gym is
burned down by a terrorist faction that is trying to prolong
strife. Director Jim Sheridan has collaborated with Day-Lewis
before on this subject (``In the Name of the Father''), but ``this
more reflective and mature film sees a bigger picture'' (Maslin).
1997. Universal. $107.37. Laser disk, $34.98. 113 minutes. Closed
captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Way Home
</P>
<P>
   For many Holocaust survivors the suffering was far from over
after they left the camps. In Mark Jonathan Harris' documentary,
life becomes a debilitating trek toward an often harsh fate in a
world that wants to avoid them. ``We were hated because we returned
from the dead,'' one refugee says. Some stumble across the Alps
with babies in their arms, hoping to reach a new state in Palestine
that itself hardly awaited them with open arms. ``Along the way,
Harris creates an intense empathy'' (Maslin). 1997. BWE. $24.95.
120 minutes. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   Mouth to Mouth
</P>
<P>
   Phone sex is an overworked film subject, but Manuel Gomez
Pereira's film gives it another try. A would-be actor, Victor
(Javier Bardem), finds that the finer points of sex on the line can
be more involved than his chosen profession. Elaborate
complications emanate from Victor's desire to connect with Ms.
Right and his telephone romps with a woman whose husband, it turns
out, is also his client. But it all gets too tangled in a film that
``sorely needs the antic talents of Pedro Almodovar'' (Maslin).
1997. Miramax. $103.91. Laser disk, $39.99. 97 minutes. Closed
captioned. Spanish with English subtitles. R.
</P>

`NIGHTS OF CABIRIA': RESTORED MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is more grace and courage in the famous image of Giulietta
Masina smiling through her tears in Federico Fellini's 1957
``Nights of Cabiria,'' the restored treasure of the summer movie
season, than there is in all the fire-breathing blockbusters
Hollywood has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The star's prize-winning, heartbreaking performance, the story's
allegorical resonance and Fellini's sweeping, soulful vision of a
Roman prostitute's resilient humanity mark ``Nights of Cabiria'' as
a cinematic masterpiece. Not coincidentally, ``Nights of Cabiria''
has been refurbished and revived by the same team (Bruce Goldstein
of Film Forum and Mike Thomas) who brought back Godard's
``Contempt'' last year, and who display the same acumen in
reissuing a film of special prescience. Though it was shot in black
and white amid the stark poverty of postwar Italy, neither the
style nor the searching of ``Cabiria'' has grown dated at all.
</P>
<P>
   As an outgrowth of characters played by Miss Masina in her
husband's earlier films, ``The White Sheik,'' ``Il Bidone'' and
``La Strada,'' the unforgettable Cabiria is a tiny, scrappy
survivor who drifts almost magically among the film's varied
realms. In three astonishing long sequences here, she is taken
under the wing of a movie star, disillusioned by a religious
pilgrimage with carnival overtones and cruelly tricked by a
hypnotist who exposes her once-secret dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The fine new 35-millimeter print, which yellows at a few points
but retains a beautiful depth and clarity, also includes an episode
that has not been seen in the film since its original showing 41
years ago at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In this section of the movie, a character who became known as
``the man with the sack'' takes Cabiria with him as he distributes
food to people so poor that they live in underground caves. Beyond
affording Cabiria a premonition of her own possible future, this
fluid and mysterious episode drew the censure of Roman Catholic
authorities, who saw the good Samaritan as a reproach to organized
religion (there are many in the film) and asked that it be excised.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of her eventful travels, Cabiria undergoes the
profound spiritual evolution that gives the film its lingering
grandeur. Anyone dismayed by the hyperkinetic emptiness of so much
current film spectacle will find the antidote _ a deep, wrenching
and eloquent filmgoing experience _ right here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nights of Cabiria'' is at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Broadway at
63rd Street. Admission is $8.50. Information: (212) 777-FILM.

TONY SMITH ART REVIEW: A FLUID RESONANCE IN THE GEOMETRIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best way to approach the new Tony Smith
retrospective at the Modern is from the north. Then you can stop at
the Doris C. Freedman Plaza at 60th Street and Fifth Avenue and
check out ``Cigarette,'' one of his best big, all-black steel
sculptures from the 1960s. It's a virtual primer on how Smith's
works work, when they do.
</P>
<P>
   They work partly by causing you to look carefully, as Smith did,
at the way geometric forms can be combined into abstract shapes
that seem to shift as you move around them.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was forever tinkering with cardboard and plaster models
shaped as tetrahedrons and octahedrons, mixing them, twisting and
turning them around, sort of like Rubik's Cubes, to find forms that
seemed to him sculpturally resonant. It's why his work, even though
it's often monumental like ``Cigarette,'' can seem provisional, as
if what you see were only a step in a process _ which is in fact
the case. Change, the idea that the same forms can keep mutating in
provocative ways, is Smith's constant.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Cigarette'' from one vantage point can look simply like a
gateway to Central Park. From a different angle, it can seem like
the legs of a kneeling figure, and from yet another it becomes what
its title says. Or really it looks like a crushed cigarette, bent
in places: a joke on Smith's part, maybe, but not a joke in the
cheerful spirit of, say, Claes Oldenburg's pillowy cigarette
sculptures. The humor in Smith's art was always black.
</P>
<P>
   I've stressed at the start what might be called the contingency
of Smith's forms because contingency gives a fair idea of his
general situation in postwar American art. Although he once made
the cover of Time, he is one of those figures who have become
famous for being hard to place: he's the other Smith in modern
American sculpture, not David.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1912 (he died in 1980), he belongs chronologically with
the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, and he considered
himself nearest to them psychologically and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But he began to make sculpture only later in life, in the 1960s,
after having been an architect and a painter, and at a moment when
a generation of Minimalists, like Donald Judd and Carl Andre,
partly reacting against Abstract Expressionist angst and
improvisation, came to prominence making work that looked very much
like Smith's austere sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   His case is a good example of what happens when we listen to
what an artist says as opposed just to looking at what he does. Roy
Lichtenstein once joked:
</P>
<P>
   ``All abstract artists try to tell you that what they do comes
from nature and I'm always trying to tell you that what I do is
completely abstract. We're both saying something we want to be
true.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is more complicated with Smith, because we partly
miss the soul of his art if we neglect what he believed about it.
But Lichtenstein's point is not altogether irrelevant: Smith
straddles movements less opposed than the history books say.
</P>
<P>
   A virtue of the Modern's intelligent, not-too-large
retrospective is that it brings together the three aspects of his
career _ architecture, painting and sculpture _ so that we can see,
for example, how Smith's approach to form had as much to do with
Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe as with
Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still, and more to do with Newman and
Still than with Judd.
</P>
<P>
   One of the familiar stories about Smith, one he liked to tell,
is that as a tubercular child he was kept apart from his brothers
and sisters in a small prefabricated house that his father built
for him in the family's backyard in New Jersey. Smith lived there
for several years in a kind of spartan isolation. The only
significant object in the house was a black stove. ``If one spends
a long time in a room with only one object,'' Smith said, ``that
object becomes a little god.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled, years later, having traveled with his parents
before he got sick to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition
in San Francisco, where he saw Pueblo houses. Alone in his small
house, he passed the time by making Pueblo models out of
papier-mache and medicine boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows whether Smith really remembered seeing the exhibition
as a 3-year-old or just thought he had in retrospect. In either
case the story is as good as true if he believed it. And it shows
us what he regarded as important: that prefabricated structures
were not vacant industrial forms but potential Proustian
madeleines; that a solitary black metal object, even a stove, could
have a spiritual aura. And that evocative shapes could be concocted
out of modular units.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Smith worked for his family's toolmaking company,
learning to use a lathe and drill press, before studying, briefly,
at the New Bauhaus in Chicago. Then he landed a job working for
Wright, his hero, on Wright's Usonian houses.
</P>
<P>
   All this explains several impressions left by the show. The
first is how closely his sculptures relate to his houses, which are
a minor revelation; functionality aside, they seem artfully attuned
to space as a fluid sculptural form. His Scoppettone House in
Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y., for example, with its mix of wood and
brick, looks virtually like a live-in version of one of his later
sculptures like ``Memphis.''
</P>
<P>
   And among his other projects it's especially a pity that his
airy, eccentric, modular proposal for a church on pillars, with
clerestory windows to be painted by Jackson Pollock, never got
built.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His paintings relate to both his architecture and sculpture.
Robert Storr, the show's organizer, stresses drawings and paintings
that involve repeating shapes and shapes that Smith varied only
slightly from one work to another to make what can appear to be
sequential images. He used amoebas, figure-eights and circles in
different configurations, and also linear forms: blocks of color
that bring to mind abstractions by Newman, Ellsworth Kelly or Ken
Noland _ but that can, more specifically, look like architectural
or sculptural fragments, colored close-ups of his own angular
constructions.
</P>
<P>
   You may notice a casualness to the way he actually put down
paint. When it's not good, Smith's work suggests a certain
anonymous and chilly indifference. His sculptures can look
industrially produced. This is partly our mistaken assumption that
all hard-edged forms are inherently cold while squishy forms are
always expressive. But I also get the impression that Smith's heart
was often more in the ideas behind the art than in the finished
products. He brought an architect's mentality to everything: he
planned what he often let others complete.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, photographs can't tell us how large his
sculptures are unless other things are in the picture for
comparison's sake, because everything he did looks innately huge.
He conveyed the fact that monumentality wasn't necessarily about
size. This was one of his contributions to modern art. That said,
some of his sculptures do register completely only at full scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moondog'' now towers over a corner of the Modern's garden as
an awesome beast that also becomes a sheltering presence once you
get under it. Like all of Smith's best work, it doesn't look the
same from any two angles or as the passing sun strikes different
facets of it.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is the same with ``Moses,'' another big sculpture in
the garden: from one side, it seems open in the middle until you
realize that the opening is a jutting volume catching the light in
such a way that the form dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   Storr describes Smith in the show's catalog as having strived
for ``a new art of a grandeur proportionate to the unfulfilled
greatness of America, and the equal of anything produced by the
most developed civilizations of the past, virtually all of which
used architecture, painting and sculpture to celebrate their gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem Smith repeatedly confronted,'' Storr adds, ``was
how to do the same in a modern, secular society, and his
experiments in all mediums reflected that improbable but devout
aim.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lavish phrases, one detects a respectful reservation
about Smith in the words ``improbable but devout,'' which seems
right. Smith's work ultimately is imperfect, incomplete, great
sometimes, not always.
</P>
<P>
   But if we tend to neglect one aspect of it, it's not the
grandeur. It's the more human side, which is often harder to
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about his anthropomorphic allusions, sardonic and
otherwise, in self-referential works like ``The Elevens Are Up'':
two big black monoliths referring to the enlarged tendons on the
neck of a heavy drinker, which Smith was.
</P>
<P>
   I also mean that Smith spent a lifetime trying to endow geometry
with feeling, to distill emotion from indifferent forms.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of wonderment to the way he kept on
discovering new shapes in these forms. To the end of his working
life he remained that boy poring over little cardboard and
papier-mache models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Smith: Architect, Painter, Sculptor,'' remains on view at
the Museum of Modern Art, 11 W. 53rd St., through Sept. 22. Five of
Smith's sculptures, including ``Cigarette,'' are installed around
midtown Manhattan. The installations were organized by the museum
in collaboration with the Public Art Fund; a map is available at
the museum.

 &HT;    RURAL HOSPITALS STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE
 &HT;    For release Saturday, July 4.
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, Ga. _ When Sara Deleza's heart stopped 10 months
ago, she was rushed to Jasper County Memorial Hospital, where the
local doctor brought her back to life, stabilized her and sent her
on her way to a major medical center to await a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   As Deleza, a 64-year-old former nurse, recovers from heart
surgery this week, she has more than once thought back to that
Sunday afternoon, realizing how she was saved by ``the little
doctor who was sent to me like an angel'' at the tiny 17-bed
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been there, I wouldn't be here,'' said Deleza,
speaking through a friend at a hospital at the University of
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Deleza was among the most dramatic of the hospital's 2,600
emergency calls last year. More often, patients arrive at the
low-slung brick building with snake bites, allergic reactions or
broken bones. But her survival illustrates how important a hospital
can be to the people living in a rural community.
</P>
<P>
   In Jasper County, that role is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, hospitals in rural communities are finding
it increasingly difficult to stay in business, and Jasper County
Memorial is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital has been in trouble for the last decade, but it has
never seen days like these. Faced with a budget shortfall of about
$300,000 this year, it also has a $500,000 debt after a renovating
its adjacent 55-bed nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small hospitals are feeling a real pinch,'' said Dr. Corbitt
Kelly, who grew up here and is now one of two doctors who treat the
county's 10,000 residents. ``Now I see that we might not make it,
and that is tough because of what this hospital means to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Rep. Charlie Norwood tell it, the culprit here is
managed care. Health maintenance companies are siphoning patients
from local communities such as Monticello and forcing them to visit
associated doctors in Atlanta and other urban centers, he said. At
the Georgia Republican's insistence, a congressional task force is
drafting legislation aimed at regulating managed care companies and
providing more rights for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural hospitals have always been the first line of defense for
health care,'' Norwood said. ``It doesn't do anyone any good to
have state-of-the-art cardiac treatment centers in Atlanta or Macon
if a patient has a heart attack in Monticello.''
</P>
<P>
   But competition from managed care is only part of the problem.
Rural hospitals are being hit even harder on two other fronts. The
federal and state governments are cutting back on Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursements as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, and a rising number of uninsured patients are seeking care.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 60 percent of Jasper Memorial's patients are
Medicare or Medicaid patients, and an additional 10 percent are
uninsured and can't pay their bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how hard it is to keep it going,'' said Tim
Jordan, president of the Monticello Bank and member of the hospital
authority's board. Jordan admits that the hospital's financial
condition is so poor that he probably could not sell the loan that
his bank granted the hospital for its nursing home renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hospital went under, I think it would be hard to
replace the jobs, but it would also be a big void. I mean, you have
to provide education for your children, but you also have to
provide health care for your community,'' Jordan said. ``On the
other hand, how do you attract new business when you don't have
something as basic as a hospital?''
</P>
<P>
   The managed care market is growing rapidly, and its impact has
been felt by rural health providers. Managed care and other health
networks are now the dominant health-care providers in America,
with about 160 million people, or 60 percent of the population,
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   But most of that growth has been in urban areas, with just about
3 percent of enrollees living in a rural community. Therefore, HMO
officials say, the reasons behind Norwood's regulatory push are
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Congress is just looking for another culprit,''
said Kevin Curtin, executive director of the Georgia Association of
HMOs, which represents 12 health maintenance organizations. ``It's
a little hard to be a culprit when you're not even there.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem in many cases, Curtin said, is that regional
hospitals demand exclusive contracts for large geographic areas of
the state, leaving rural hospitals out in the cold. ``That makes
the rural patients drive past their local hospitals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Parker, president of the Georgia Hospital Association,
said it is not a regional-vs.-rural issue. He said regional
hospitals supported a recent state law that benefited rural
health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Rural hospitals play a critical role in assuring access to basic
health care to underserved populations, he said. Rural communities
have a higher infant mortality rate, a higher adolescent pregnancy
rate and a higher number of people living below poverty, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the state of rural hospitals,'' Parker
said. ``When you lose a hospital, you lose a physician. When you
lose a physician, you lose businesses in rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, said Parker, is for the community to come together
and save hospitals like Jasper Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Without rural hospitals, patients such as Deleza would not
survive a trip to a hospital in Atlanta or even the 30 miles to the
closest regional hospital, doctors and health-care experts say.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Jasper County, Ga., is happening throughout
the country. The most recent tally by the Office of Inspector
General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows
that only 10 of the nation's 5,134 rural hospitals closed in 1996,
but health-care experts say that hundreds more are drowning in red
ink.
</P>
<P>
   To the people of Monticello, losing the hospital is akin to
losing a family member. It is as much a part of the community's
fabric as the high school's Hurricanes sports teams, fried chicken
at the Tillman House, or the annual Fourth of July fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an anchor in this community,'' said Martha Mock, an
English professor and interior designer who grew up here. ``In a
large city, the first thing they ask you, is do you have insurance?
Here, (Dr.) Corbitt Kelly says how can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday night, the emergency room doctor saw a
25-year-old man who couldn't move his neck because he had banged it
against a wall a Metallica concert the night before. There was a
23-year-old woman who had cut her finger opening a can of cat food.
But there were more serious cases, such as an 85-year-old man who
couldn't articulate what was wrong with him. Tests at the hospital
showed his discomfort came from a urinary tract infection.
</P>
<P>
   For hospital personnel, patients like these are a reason to go
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart is here,'' said Norma Mattison, the lab technician
who diagnosed the elderly man's trouble. ``It's like a church here.
You want to help everyone who comes in the door and most often, you
know their name.''

ANTIQUES: GREEN FEES (SO TO SPEAK) FOR GOLFERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 1968 book ``The Truth About Golf, and Other Lies''
(Doubleday), Buddy Hackett describes a round of golf with Jimmy
Durante: ``Jimmy's first round was a total disaster. As he came to
the 18th hole, his partner, who had long since lost count,
estimated Jimmy's score was over 200. After holing out for 12, the
Schnoz turned to his companion and asked, `What should I give the
caddie?' Without smiling, the friend answered, `Your clubs!'''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Hackett was retelling a joke, but nowadays it might be the
caddie who has the last laugh. A set of old golf clubs can be
extremely valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 million Americans play golf, and 5,000 collect antique
clubs, balls, trophies, medals, ceramics, trinkets and books,
according to Morton Olman, the 82-year-old owner of the Old Golf
Shop in Pleasant Plain, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb, and a recognized
authority on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Mutch, the curator of Golf House, the U.S. Golf Association
Museum and Library in Far Hills, N.J., which has 50,000 items,
said, ``People get as hooked on collecting as on the game itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf memorabilia have become a big business. Christie's,
Sotheby's, Phillips and Bonham's all conduct auctions of
memorabilia. The next one, on Tuesday, is a Christie's sale in
Glasgow, Scotland, of property from the Royal Perth Golfing Society
and the Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perth was founded in 1824 and was granted royal patronage in
1833, even before St. Andrews,'' said Christie's golf specialist,
Edward Monagle. ``So the sale gives us real insight into one of the
earliest golfing societies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's ``Golf, Cricket, Boxing and Other Traditional Sports''
sale will be held in London next Friday; the Phillips golf sale is
scheduled for July 14 in Chester, England, and Bonhams' first sale
devoted to golf will held be Aug. 8 in Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   There are websites for collectors, too. One site,
www.golfmuseum.com, lists the collection of the Philadelphia
Private Golf Museum, which Christie's is trying to sell privately
for $2.8 million. It includes 17 of the earliest feather golf
balls, gutta percha (a form of rubber) balls from the 1850's,
medals, trophies, tankards and a bronze sculpture of a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Golf antiques fall into two categories: serious (expensive) and
nonserious (under $500). Titus Kendall, a private dealer in London
who helped assemble the Valderrama Golf Museum in Sottogrande,
Spain, for its owner, Jaime Ortiz-Patino, said, ``You can't mix
trinkets with serious history.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall attended the Pacific Book Auction Galleries' sale of
golf books in San Francisco last month. It featured the collection
of Joseph Murdoch, a renowned bibliographer of golf books, which
went for $743,750. ``We bought a seventh of the sale,'' he said.
``It included the third edition, from 1793, of the first printed
book on golf, called `The Goff,' a prose poem by Thomas Mathison.
It sold for $80,500.'' The buyer was Richard Donovan, a dealer in
rare golf books in Endicott, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   George Fox, a vice president of the Galleries, said: ``When you
pay $250 to play a round at Pebble Beach, spending $1,000 on a book
is not a big deal. No other sport has books like golf books.
Baseball books don't go for $10,000 apiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who spent years assembling the Valderrama collection,
noted that a ``really early, rare and interesting'' golf club can
cost $200,000, a feather ball, between $20,000 and $40,000, and a
gutta percha ball, $17,000. ``Before 1900, golf was rarefied,'' he
said. ``Until 1850, it was a terribly expensive game played by rich
people in England or Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   There were enthusiasts from the beginning. Kendall has found
early 17th-century Dutch tiles depicting golfers in blue and white
and a famille vert Chinese porcelain bowl of 1797 with golfers on
it. How did the Chinese know what golfers looked like? ``They
copied the letterhead of the Honorable Company of Golfers,''
Kendall explained.
</P>
<P>
   In H.B. Martin's 1966 book ``50 Years of American Golf,'' he
quotes David R. Forgan's widely circulated tribute to the game.
Golf, Forgan wrote, ``is a contest, a duel or a melee calling for
courage, skill, strategy and self-control. It is a test of temper,
a trial of honor, a revealer of character.''
</P>
<P>
   So is collecting at these prices. Mutch, the curator, advises
people to consider only items in mint condition, with solid
provenance, rarity and some history. ``The golf collecting market
does not lend itself to retail stores,'' he said. ``There's no
one-stop shopping. It's a networking thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Olman warned that clubs and balls are sometimes dated
incorrectly in catalogs. The earliest clubs had shafts that were
not too tapered, he said. He advises people to examine feather
balls, the earliest balls, made of leather stuffed tightly with
goose feathers. ``If they have holes in them, someone tried to
mount them and they aren't good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He values rarity. He said he bought a machine, circa 1850, at
Phillips' golf sale last November in New York that made
crosshatching marks on golf balls. The bidding started at $5,000
but ended at $64,000, when Olman got it. Olman is attracted to a
signed watercolor by J. Michael Brown titled ``Carnoustie, 1891,''
in the Christie's sale on Tuesday. The painting, of a Scottish golf
course where the British Open is scheduled be played in 1999, is
expected to sell for $17,000 to $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   At a Sotheby's auction at St. Andrews in 1995, Olman paid
$92,000 for two Brown paintings. On July 10, Sotheby's is
auctioning a red golf-club captain's coat from 1938 with the Gothic
initials DGC on the brass buttons. Sotheby's golf specialist,
Edward Playfair, explained that golfers from the earliest days were
asked to wear red jackets when they played on common land to alert
people to the danger of ``missiles flying through the air.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also selling a red golf ball from 1855 (estimate: 1,500 to
2,500 pounds, or $2,500 to $4,166). Beginning in the 1850s, red
balls were produced for players who wanted to play in the snow.
Martin's history notes that golfers used red balls to play golf in
the snow in Yonkers, N.Y., as early as 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently few New York dealers specialize in golf antiques, but
several galleries carry a few pieces. Pamela Walker, a private
dealer in Manhattan and Southampton, sells golf cuff links, ties,
watches and drinks paraphernalia. She recently sold four charming
glass stirrers for drinks depicting dogs playing golf, for $65.
</P>
<P>
   Deco Deluxe (993 Lexington Ave., at 71st Street, Manhattan) has
a few items, mostly from the 1930s. ``Golf stuff goes for a
fortune,'' said the owner, Sandi Berman, ``because golf is a rich
man's sport and things were made of good quality to appeal to
people with money.'' She has a pair of silver-plated golf ball salt
and pepper shakers from England for $220, an International Silver
golf bag pencil cup for $485, a metal golf bag lighter for $275 and
an etched glass martini shaker depicting a stooped (possibly
looped) golfer for $275.
</P>
<P>
   Couper Lord, a private dealer in Southampton, N. Y., is a
walking encyclopedia of the history of his two local clubs:
Shinnecock Hills, America's oldest incorporated golf club (1892),
and the National Golf Links of America (1908). Lord sells old
photographs of some of the great players, vintage books, ceramics
from various golf clubs, plaques and medals.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't sell his best piece: an antique wooden whirligig
golfer in his backyard. It's a piece of true folk art, and when the
ocean breeze is stiff, this golfer has a swing as wild as Jimmy
Durante's.

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From Hoops To Heartaches &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It is often said in Hollywood that young directors
and writers should start with a subject they know well, so why is
Kevin Rodney Sullivan making his debut as a feature film director
with a movie about a woman's search for love in seemingly the wrong
place?
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a onetime child actor who has written screenplays and
directed television movies, has directed ``How Stella Got Her
Groove Back,'' a film based on Terry McMillan's popular novel and
due in theaters on Aug. 14. The movie, about a 40-year-old career
woman and single mother who falls in love with a Jamaican man 20
years her junior, stars Angela Bassett as Stella and Whoopi
Goldberg as her good friend Delilah. It is being distributed by
20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who has been eager to direct a feature film, said the
choice of this ``woman's movie'' was not as unusual as it might
sound. First, the last movie based on one of Ms. McMillan's novels,
``Waiting to Exhale,'' was also directed by a man, Forest Whitaker.
More important, Sullivan said, ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back''
is about love, and that is something men can understand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sullivan, 39, whose last television film was ``The Soul
of the Game,'' for HBO, about basketball, fathers and sons, said
directing ``Stella'' had, in some respects, been an odd experience.
There were plenty of times, he said, that he and Ron Bass, one of
the screenwriters, felt a little lonely, since the film focuses on
a woman, her best friend and her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron and I were the only men in the room a lot of times,''
Sullivan said. ``It made us friends real quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan spent years as an actor, appearing in ``Star Trek II:
The Wrath of Khan,'' and in the television series ``Happy Days.''
He then wrote for the television series ``Fame'' and directed
television movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a lie to say there was no difference making a
movie like this,'' he said, referring to ``Stella.'' ``But I know
what it is like to be into and to fall in love with the most
inappropriate person. It didn't feel like I was going on an
expedition into unknown territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, there were plenty of times that he and
Bass had to defer to what the actresses said a woman would feel or
not feel at a certain moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who is black, said that he felt that the movie was
first and foremost a love story, but that he was concerned it might
be perceived as a ``black film'' and thus marketed to a limited
audience. He expressed some frustration with the fact that even
though there are many ethnic movies, so-called black movies still
frequently had to struggle for the marketing muscle to attract a
broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film business is a little slow in getting around to what
the world is thinking,'' he said. ``The world is not Anglo-Saxon.
The paying audience wants diversity, and they appreciate good
stories no matter what the cultural background. Films like this, I
think, say the barrier should come down a little quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weird Is Cool &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the entertainment conglomerates get, the more they
rely on supposed formulas for making successful movies. And few
formulas are embraced more than the one that says that when the
weather turns hot, a blockbuster needs lots of special effects, a
marketing tie-in with a taco and a strong dose of death and mayhem.
Just like in, say, ``Dr. Dolittle.'' Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were shattered when ``Dr. Dolittle,'' an oddball
children's film from 20th Century Fox starring the protean Eddie
Murphy, battered its rivals and brought in an astounding $29
million on its opening last weekend. Jaws dropped around Hollywood
because, put simply, the film, about a strange doctor who can talk
to animals, does not fit the formulas. Worse, critics were
generally hostile. Richard Corliss, of Time, was typical in calling
it a ``slow, vacant farce.'' (Janet Maslin of The New York Times,
however, called it ``the sunniest family film so far this
season.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out kids don't read reviews,'' said Betty Thomas, the
movie's outspoken director. ``I guess that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas, 49, was gloating happily about the success of ``Dr.
Dolittle,'' but even she admitted that she had no idea the film
would open so big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confused by the initial reaction,'' she said. ``But it's
funny. Doesn't anyone remember how to have fun anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   But as improbable as the movie's immense success is the fact
that a director like Ms. Thomas made it. Not surprisingly, she said
she initially scoffed at the project. The movie is based on the
sweet children's stories of Hugh Lofting and follows by several
decades a treacly, musical version of the movie that starred Rex
Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like cute,'' said Ms. Thomas, which is not hard to
believe, given that her last movie was ``Private Parts,'' about the
sex-obsessed shock jock Howard Stern. ``I'm not a fan of cute. I'm
into funny. My kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her first reaction was swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Get serious,''' Ms. Thomas recalled. ``Then they said
Eddie Murphy was going to do it. That's when I said: `That's
interesting. That's unusual. That's not what people expect.' I like
to come out of left field, so that appealed. Eddie was the
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   With Murphy's edgy brand of comedy, the movie was given a
slightly irreverent tone, with many anatomical jokes. That
contributed, Ms. Thomas said, to the real message behind the movie,
which worked hard to make more than just a romp with a silly man
who thinks he can talk to animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the movie's about the artists in the world
and how we have to accept them as they are,'' Ms. Thomas said.
``Parents are too busy saying to their kids, you have to get good
grades, you have to get into the right schools, you have to do
everything right. I felt we had to get across that weird people are
where it's at!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boom Town &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's stock in trade is illusion, of course, principally
about itself. But one of its greatest illusions is less well known
_ the fact that the movie studios, as businesses, have never been
that significant a presence in the Los Angeles economy. That is,
until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. recently issued a
report on the film industry in large part to counter some old myths
and to underscore the remarkable arc of growth in this booming
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The movie studios were once dwarfed as employers by other
industries, like aerospace, particularly in cities like Burbank
that had a reputation of being dominated by the studios. But the
recession of the early 1990's hit the aerospace companies hard, and
the subsequent boom in all facets of entertainment has made the
studios, for the first time, huge businesses with payrolls to match
the impact of the movies on the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, 96,000 jobs were added to the movie
industry between 1990 and 1997. Another 6,000 jobs have been added
this year, which the report said made it something of a slow one.
The economic development corporation estimates that total
movie-related employment in Los Angeles County is now 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even those figures understate the impact of the industry on the
local economy, however. According to the report, these are not
ordinary jobs; they pay significantly more than other kinds of
jobs, on average. By one estimate, these jobs pay $53,000 a year on
average.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Producers Association said earlier this year
that the industry generated $25.6 billion in economic activity in
Los Angeles County in 1996, the latest year for which there are
figures, compared with $15 billion in 1992. And the report
estimated that between now and 2001, demand for films will grow 7
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the more interesting pieces of information about the
structure of the movie industry concerned who employs all these
people. According to the report, the studios themselves actually
account for a tiny fraction of the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Figures supplied by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that
a whopping 78 percent of jobs came from companies with one to four
employees. Another 8.6 percent of the jobs were at companies with
five to nine employees. Less than 1 percent of the jobs came from
employers with 1,000 or more employees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the vast majority of the overall employment in
the movie industry does not come from the most visible entities,
the studios, but from tiny companies. And most of those provide
specific services, including everything from costume design to
computerized special effects, often on a per job basis.

`MACBETH': WHEN HIGHJINKS OUTWEIGH SHAKESPEARE'S WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It must be the fashion this year for theater
productions to begin before the audiences arrive. Turn up half an
hour early for ``Cabaret,'' for instance, and there are the
decadent Kit Kat Girls, slithering and stretching onstage,
establishing the Weimar atmosphere for the show to come.
</P>
<P>
   Arrive a little early for the International WOW Theater
Company's production of ``Macbeth,'' and there are various cast
members with swords, witch's brooms and other props, moving about
and interacting in clearly choreographed ways. Periodically one of
the jump-suited actors identified in the program as the Machinists
comes to the center and speaks into a walkie-talkie in a loud voice
of intense fear. This is expert mood establishment.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Macbeth,'' performed at the Washington Square Methodist
Church in Greenwich Village, is a daring blend of styles that works
more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   The witches (Amo Gulinello, Jy Murphy and Robert Saietta) remove
their wigs and black robes, don straw hats and turn into vaudeville
song-and-dance men. Banquo's ghost is covered with enough blood to
have come from a scene in ``Reservoir Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical accompaniment includes ``Any Way You Want It,'' some
romantic 1920s instrumentals and the orchestral crescendo from the
Beatles' ``Day in the Life.'' (Surrounding the ``ravell'd sleave of
care'' speech with theme music from the television series ``Three's
Company'' and a loud laugh track, however, was a bad idea.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the best parts of the evening are nonverbal, which is
an odd thing for Shakespeare. If the cast members could put as much
originality and conviction into their lines as they invest in their
behavior, this would be an outstanding production. To be fair, all
young interpreters of Shakespeare are at a disadvantage in an era
when audiences can rent a Kenneth Branagh interpretation at the
corner video store, but much more attention should have been paid
to making these Elizabethan words the actors' own.
</P>
<P>
   The story of a husband-and-wife team who kill the husband's
rivals to gain power, then love the perks but hate the guilt, is
certainly as meaningful today as when it was written, and the
actors have hold of its universality.
</P>
<P>
   Aya Ogawa makes a forceful, seductive Lady Macbeth, although the
sleepwalking scene is one of her least effective.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Fox, who directed the production with Ron Russell, turns in
an uneven performance as Macbeth, somewhat unconvincing in his
moments of guilt and fear but charming and engaging when his
character is high on his own new-found power.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Frace is appropriately confident as Duncan but plays
Macduff with a deliberate quietness that works only now and then.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there are many praise-worthy aspects to the
production, including Fox's evocatively dark sound and lighting,
and the set, by Fox and Caitlin Connolly, which makes good use of
the church's interior.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's and Saturday afternoon's performances,
``Macbeth'' continues, on Friday evenings only, through July 31.
</P>
<P>

U.S., MEXICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL SEEK TO PATCH DIFFERENCES OVER DRUG
STING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ The attorneys general of Mexico and the
United States, seeking to patch soured relations over a sweeping
American money-laundering investigation, signed a three-page letter
Thursday pledging cooperation and greater openness in the
international drug war.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, codenamed Operation Casablanca, was
triumphantly revealed in May by U.S. authorities, but Mexican
officials quickly condemned the brashness of the operation and
threatened to pursue criminal charges against American agents who
operated in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from 12 Mexican banks were among those arrested in the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   The letter signed Thursday by Attorney General Janet Reno and
her Mexican counterpart, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, includes a
provision to give advance notice of any ``major or otherwise
sensitive cross-border activity of our federal law enforcement
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   It also includes various other pledges of bilateral
understanding, training and cooperation, but it does not address
Mexico's stated intent to seek extradition and prosecution of the
U.S. agents.
</P>
<P>
   Reno took no questions after the ceremony, and Madrazo paused
only briefly to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But in a news release, he vowed to prosecute anyone who broke
Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to clearly state that this agreement in no way
impedes the Attorney General of the (Mexican) Republic in
continuing on-going investigation to determine if agents,
informants or witnesses cooperating with the government of the
United States committed any crimes in the national territory (of
Mexico) in connection with Operation Casablanca,'' Madrazo's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to continue his investigation of the Mexican banks
and bankers who were the targets of Operation Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year Treasury Department probe broke in early May with
the indictment of 26 Mexican bank officials, as well as more than
120 other individuals.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the elaborately orchestrated operation would
result in the seizure of more than $150 million in illicit funds.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the Mexican bankers were arrested in a sting
operation in Mesquite, Nev., after they were invited to attend the
grand opening of ``The Casablanca,'' a gambling casino, allegedly
financed with the proceeds of the money-laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   The charges allege that 12 of Mexico's 19 largest banks were
involved with laundering money from drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican national pride quickly turned Operation Casablanca from
a crime-fighting triumph into an American trampling of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo issued harsh criticism of the
investigation, saying: ``It is inadmissible because it is a
violation of our sovereignty; it is inadmissible because it
tramples on our laws; and it is inadmissible because it violates
international law and weakens our bilateral cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials also filed a formal complaint and said they
would attempt to extradite and prosecute the U.S. agents they said
had violated Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, Mexican officials acknowledged they had been
informed two years ago of the investigation, but said they had had
no detailed briefings on its scope.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton quickly attempted to mend fences by calling
Zedillo and acknowledging that the United States should have
informed Mexican authorities of undercover operations on Mexican
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's letter of understanding, addressed to both
presidents, closed on a note of hopeful optimism that historically
has rarely been realized by these two uneasy neighbors, who share
an intractable drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law enforcement relationship between our two countries is
important to each of us and to the citizens of both our
countries,'' the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these renewed understandings, we are confident that we
will enhance our cooperation and further our accomplishments
against the criminal organizations that threaten the security and
well-being of our countries.''

   &UR; A De Kooning Depicts Kennedy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Willem de Kooning's painting ``Reclining Man'' has been in the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington since Joseph
Hirshhorn, the museum's founder, acquired it in 1964. But though
signed by the artist, the painting was undated.
</P>
<P>
   Now museum officials say the work was finished in 1963 and the
artist, who died in 1997, modeled the face of the figure on
President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the identity of the face in the painting arose
five years ago when ``Reclining Man'' was part of an exhibition for
artist's 90th birthday. At that time, several Hirshhorn officials
commented to Judith Zilczer, the museum's paintings curator, that
the man's face uncannily resembled Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Zilczer said, ``nothing in our records had indicated
that the face was of our late president.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching the issue, the curator could not consult de
Kooning, who had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for years. So
she spoke to Susan Brockman, the artist who was de Kooning's
companion at the time Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zilczer recalled that Ms. Brockman said ``Reclining Man''
was the artist's portrayal of Kennedy. The curator also said Ms.
Brockman remembered that on the day of the assassination and for
the next four days, de Kooning, like many Americans, was glued to
the television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was utterly involved. He was very moved, Ms. Zilczer
quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zilczer added that Ms. Brockman said de Kooning's paintings
were always loosely based on something he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Others confirmed the artist's preoccupation with Kennedy at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   In their diaries, de Kooning's close friends and neighbors Ibram
and Ernestine Lassaw recalled watching television with him on Nov.
23. And another friend, the photographer Hans Namuth, took a series
of 35-millimeter color transparencies of the painting, which he
dated 1963. The barren landscape and bare trees visible through the
artist's studio windows in two of the transparencies indicate that
the time of year was late fall or early winter, Ms. Zilczer said.
</P>
<P>
   There was another tie between de Kooning and Kennedy. The
artist's estranged wife, Elaine de Kooning, with whom he still had
contact, had been working for nearly a year on a portrait of the
President for the Truman Library, and her East Hampton studio was
filled with sketches of Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have revised the date and the title'' of the work, Ms.
Zilczer said. ``It now is dated 1963, and we have added `John F.
Kennedy' in parentheses after `Reclining Man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The painting is unusual because de Kooning is best known for
expressionist images of women and rarely painted men or portraits
of recognizable individuals. When the work first entered the
Hirshhorn collection, it was thought to have been painted in 1964
because that was when Hirshhorn bought it, and he had an agreement
with de Kooning for right of first refusal on works as the artist
painted them in return for subsidizing some construction costs for
the artist's new Long Island studio.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she thought the artist never identified his subject,
Ms. Zilczer said: ``I have a hunch this was his personal response
to a national tragedy, and he didn't want to exploit the subject.
Nor, I suspect, did he want to steal Elaine's thunder.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pompidou in New York &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York has formed a
temporary partnership with the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the Pompidou Center's galleries are closed for
renovation until 2000, the institution has agreed to team up with
the Guggenheim to present two major exhibitions, one at the
Guggenheim's Fifth Avenue headquarters and the other at its SoHo
branch. Both shows will open in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a one-time unprecedented opportunity where we could
structure shows using anything we wanted from both museums,'' said
Lisa Dennison, the Guggenheim's deputy director and chief curator.
``Even though the Pompidou Center is a public institution and we
are a private one, we're both quite similar. We're both about 40
years old, we both have radical buildings, and we discovered our
collections perfectly complement one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The uptown exhibition will be called ``Rendezvous: Masterpieces
From Centre Georges Pompidou and the Guggenheim Museums'' and will
fill the entire building. Using more than 350 paintings, sculptures
and drawings by about 150 artists, the show will chart the history
of modern art from the turn of the century until 1970. Among the
artists whose works will be on view are Picasso, Matisse, Ernst,
Dubuffet, Klein and Beuys.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, one institution owns the study for a final
painting in the other. For example, Kandinsky's painting and oil
studies for ``Landscape With Tower'' (1908) and ``In the Black
Square'' (1923) will be shown together.
</P>
<P>
   The show in SoHo, ``Premises: Invested Spaces in Visual Arts,
Architecture and Design From France, 1958-1998,'' will concentrate
on more contemporary works and will explore the relationship
between the artist and the architect.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the expected names like Jean Dubuffet, Christian
Boltanski, Le Corbusier and Jean Nouvel, the show will also include
younger artists and architects, many not well known in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Warhol for Israel &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the 50th anniversary of the Israel Museum in
Jerusalem, an international group of donors has given the
institution Warhol's ``10 Portraits of Jews in the 20th Century''
from 1980. The piece consists of silk-screen portraits of Sarah
Bernhardt, Louis Brandeis, Martin Buber, Albert Einstein, Sigmund
Freud, George Gershwin, Franz Kafka, the Marx Brothers, Golda Meir
and Gertrude Stein.

TOWARD A NEW AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Due to holiday peg, moving on the a.m. cycle.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday is the Fourth of July, a holiday celebrated with the
traditional American pastimes: family reunions, cookouts, and
fireworks. But it is also a time for somber reflection. And a time,
perhaps, for giving back.
</P>
<P>
   What better day than Independence Day to acknowledge the
terrible injustices committed by our ancestors? To face history,
and ourselves, and to recognize that one man or woman's
``independence'' inevitably entails the enslavement or degradation
of a fellow human being.
</P>
<P>
   Cast your mind back 222 years. Imagine the plight of the hated
Tory, or Loyalist _ ordinary citizens of Boston, like yourselves.
These were the Bruce Lindseys and Sidney Blumenthals of their time,
men who put loyalty to their sovereign ahead of narrow personal
concerns. While Sam Adams and his petit-bourgeois pals brayed about
customs regulations and ``taxation without representation,''
Loyalists stood by king and country. You're such a fan of
representative government? I give you Jesse Helms, the late Sonny
Bono, and congressional hopeful Marjorie Clapprood. They were worth
fighting a war over?
</P>
<P>
   What fate befell the Tories? They paid the ultimate price. Most
were forced to move to Canada, home of Alex Trebek, socialized
television, and the ever-plunging dollar. Their ancestors now eke
out a living in towns like Shelburne, Nova Scotia, which had more
Harvard graduates in the '80s than Cambridge. The 1780s, that is.
It is time to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   Or what of the bedraggled Hessian mercenaries, objects of
universal derision in our history books? Sons of a great,
peace-loving nation, plucked from peaceful husbandry behind the
plow to fight an unpopular war in a foreign land. Poorly clothed
and fed, dodging bullets fired by grog-sodden cowards from behind
hedgerows. How do you think they felt?
</P>
<P>
   Do I have something concrete in mind? Yes. It's not enough to
apologize for our shortcomings, as our president recently did
before the slavemasters of Beijing. (World Cup soccer balls
stitched by Chinese prison labor? Talk about bad timing for that
little revelation ...) It is time for redress. I propose nothing
short of returning the original 13 colonies to their rightful
owners, the resurgent House of Windsor and ``Cool Britannia.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm prepared to bow and scrape
before the incipient King William. People magazine reports he's
endowed with his mother's ``sapphire eyes,'' and has the initials
W.O.W. (William of Wales) monogrammed on his racing Speedos. WOW
indeed! And if it's constitutional government you want, they've got
a mediagenic prime minister who seems every bit as alert as our own
guy, but doesn't fool around. Plus Britain has real tabloid
newspapers, the Spice Girls, and a terrific national anthem to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop there? Would you like to know how we acquired all
those flat states lined up along the Mississippi River? Tom
Jefferson stole them, that's how. That's right. Tiresome Tom,
champion of much-bruited ``Jeffersonian'' ideals, took advantage of
a country in chaos to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase from
war-torn France. Louisiana Swindle is more like it. How about
Texas? Land-hungry cattle barons trumped up the Battle of the Alamo
_ the Tonkin Gulf incident of its time _ and look whose armies are
marching down to the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a past we can be proud of? Give it back, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Alaska, too. If Boris wants it back, we'll surrender it to
him. We'll see how the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge fares at the hands
of the Russian Environmental Protection Agency. (Hint: Russia
doesn't have an Environmental Protection Agency.) California? What
Rupert Murdoch and the Japanese don't own goes back to Mexico. Then
we won't have to listen to Pat Buchanan yapping about a ``border
wall'' during Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we keep? We're keeping a patch of the original Boston
_ the North End _ at least until the end of today. I need a place
to watch the Italy-France World Cup quarterfinal match, and I want
to enjoy it on American soil. After that, who knows? Maybe Tony
Blair will let us keep Rhode Island.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ARMAGEDDON,' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.
Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This big, showy,
spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single heartfelt
moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip club. Imminent
doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes the excuse for
rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion of heroism
that has nothing whatever to do with real courage. Willis gets the
film's noblest lines for the same reason that he probably got the
set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries gamely to seem mad about Ms.
Tyler, who serves as window-dressing at NASA headquarters. Totally
predictable elements _ loud noises, frequent explosions and bright
computer-screen colors _ seem as inevitable and deadly as the
asteroid while they create the illusion of escapist fun (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BULWORTH,' starring Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Platt
and Christine Baranski. Directed by Beatty (R, 108 minutes). A
revitalized Beatty directs this political satire with jubilant wit
and energy, playing the ultimate limousine liberal with comic
panache as a white politician suddenly turned homeboy (and turned
on to black urban culture and a passionately liberal agenda).
Taking a potentially cheap fish-out-of-water gimmick and making it
deeply, disarmingly funny, he returns to the anything-goes
tradition of 1970s dropout comedy. As the fretful, spin-controlling
aide to Beatty's wayward senator, Platt is uproariously sly
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CITY OF ANGELS,' starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Directed
by Brad Silberling (PG-13, 112 minutes). An empty Hollywood remake
of ``Wings of Desire,'' Wim Wenders' poetic 1987 cult favorite,
``City of Angels'' wants to be a blockbuster sob fest in the
supernatural romantic tradition of ``Heaven Can Wait,'' ``Ghost''
and ``Titanic.'' But the ingredients don't gel. Cage is the droopy
sad-sack angel who falls in love with Ms. Ryan's perky, bike-riding
Los Angeles cardiologist and tumbles out of heaven just to be with
her. Unfortunately, Cage looks more like a serial killer (or a
sinister cult leader) than an angel, and he and Ms. Ryan lack
romantic chemistry. The screenplay's watered-down New Age cliches
are illustrated by cinematography that lends the California
settings the shallow gloss of a shampoo commercial (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `COUSIN BETTE,' starring Jessica Lange, Elisabeth Shue and Bob
Hoskins. Directed by Des McAnuff (R, 108 minutes). Balzac's great
novel of 1840s Paris, like Tom Wolfe's ``Bonfire of the Vanities,''
of which it is an obvious forerunner, is far too big and sprawling
to be compressed into a film of average length. Gifted theater
director McAnuff, making his feature-film debut, has staged the
novel's greedy social climbing and revenge as a cartoonish
``Masterpiece Theater'' spoof in which an avaricious courtesan (Ms.
Shue) and an ambitious young sculptor (Aden Young) who wreak sexual
havoc are charmless buffoons. Ms. Lange is grimly opaque as a
vengeful, scheming cousin who manipulates these narcissists into
destroying the aristocratic relatives who have humiliated her
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP IMPACT,' starring Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood,
Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell and Morgan Freeman. Directed by
Mimi Leder (PG-13, 120 minutes). Apparently there is no better aid
to family therapy than a murderously large meteor hurtling toward
Earth. So this is a more sensitive sci-fi disaster film than most,
with lovers bonding and old wounds healing as the summer's first
colossal cinematic catastrophe looms. This thriller is vigorously
made, but it provides less grisly mayhem than might be expected. As
the planet faces extinction, attention is paid to rescuing art,
antiques, elephants and flamingos. Special-effects wizardry
provides a suitably devastating tidal wave (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DR. DOLITTLE,' starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty Thomas
(PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the animals,
they pile on the back-talk, thanks to the stellar cast of vocal
talent (Ellen DeGeferes, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John
Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Murphy plays
straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film
is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than
``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Murphy's understated
timing, but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from
the animal cast (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS,' starring Johnny Depp and
Benicio Del Toro. Directed by Terry Gilliam (R, 120 minutes).
Gilliam, the visually ingenious cinematic maestro behind ``Brazil''
and ``12 Monkeys,'' has filmed Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 classic of
gonzo journalism with an astonishing fidelity to the book's
psychedelic phantasmagoria. But if this is as close to recreating
the sensory world of an acid trip that a mainstream film has ever
come, the movie packs the book's vignettes into an overstuffed
hodgepodge. Where the book conveyed a spirit of open-ended
adventure in which each new caper could be spun out into its own
little movie, the film rarely gives the book's appallingly funny
anecdotes room to breathe. Depp, who has been made partly bald for
the role of Raoul Duke, turns in a clever performance. And Del
Toro's portrayal of Raoul's gun-waving sidekick and ``attorney,''
Dr. Gonzo, is a tour de force of unfettered goonishness (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GODZILLA,' starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria
and Maria Pitillo. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 139
minutes). The ads for ``Godzilla'' proclaim that ``size does
matter.'' But it turns out that bigger doesn't necessarily mean
better. The animatronic lizard that rises from the ocean and stomps
on a number of New York City landmarks has thundering metallic
footsteps but still has the impact of a weightless cartoon monster.
The movie doesn't get scary until halfway through, when the beast's
eggs hatch (in what's left of Madison Square Garden) and an army of
more lifelike baby Godzillas threatens to devour the search party.
The storytelling and acting in this $120 million wad of gummed-up
popcorn reaches new depths of crudeness and ineptitude for a
so-called Event Movie (Holden).

 UNDATED: Movie (Holden).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `GOOD WILL HUNTING,' starring Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben
Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Gus Van
Sant; written by Damon and Affleck (R, 125 minutes). Everybody
loves a Cinderella story, and here are two of them, one on screen
and one behind the scenes. Damon and Affleck, two young actors with
soaring reputations, have written themselves a smart and touching
screenplay, then seen it directed with style, shrewdness and
clarity by Van Sant. As a reluctant math prodigy working as a
janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Damon lives
up to his abundant hype; as the savvy psychotherapist who locks
horns with this mercurial genius, Williams has the rare serious
role that takes full advantage of his talents. With Ms. Driver as
the Harvard University premed student who adds romance to the
equation. This heartfelt, inviting film is the best offbeat
coming-of-age story this side of Gilbert Grape (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE WITH THE WIND,' starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia
de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by Victor
Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life left
in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's
romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never existed) just
before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great film but a
satisfying one. The performances by Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable and
Hattie McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in the
meticulous physical production. The movie shows its age most
unfortunately in the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints,
which, though new, go sort of pinkish more often than they should
(Vincent Canby).

   `HE GOT GAME,' starring Denzel Washington and Ray Allen.
Directed by Spike Lee (R, 131 minutes). This is a Spike Lee joint
that deserves to be a Spike Lee hit, long overdue. Stunning
cinematography (by Malik Hassan Sayeed), an explosion of
spectacular gambits and a great high-concept hook make this his
biggest, boldest film in years. Washington, in a splendid and
carefully measured performance that keeps this busy film from
spinning out of control, stretches considerably to play a loser.
He's a convict with a one-week prison leave that he must use to
persuade his estranged son, a high school basketball prodigy played
with natural ease by Allen, the NBA star, to sign up with a
governor's favorite college team. Surrounding this compelling
father-son drama are humorous montages, satirical sports-world
sketches and acerbic observations to keep the film roaming eagerly,
and excitingly, all over the map (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOPE FLOATS,' starring Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr. and
Gena Rowlands. Directed by Forest Whitaker (PG-13, 112 minutes).
This pajama-party women's picture starts out on a talk show and
stays there, raising issues like divorce, single parenthood,
mother-daughter relationships, caring for aging relatives and
summoning the courage to date after trauma. But Ms. Bullock, who is
actually seen cheerleading here, gives her best approximation of
America's sweetheart since ``While You Were Sleeping,'' and her
winning performance helps make up for the film's cute streak and
rosy, commercial glow. Ms. Rowlands does a feisty, down-to-earth
turn as the star's Texas mama, even if the story gives her
taxidermy for an offbeat hobby. As the post-divorce dreamboat,
Connick is on the tepid side. ``The Horse Whisperer'' does this
kind of serene, resuscitating romance much better (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HORSE WHISPERER,' starring Robert Redford, Kristin Scott
Thomas and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Redford (PG-13, 164
minutes). There's a blunt soap opera of a movie inside Nicholas
Evans' widely popular novel. But Redford, directing himself for the
first time, with intelligence and restraint, has found a visually
eloquent way to turn it into something much more thoughtful and
tranquil. Magnificently photographed by Robert Richardson, this
film is a wide-screen love affair with the West, and a story more
of peace and healing than of ardor. Though it's long and its
resolution is a problem, this is an enveloping film that richly
rewards the viewer's attention (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LOST IN SPACE,' starring William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Heather
Graham, Matt LeBlanc, Gary Oldman, Lacey Chabert and Jack Johnson.
Directed by Stephen Hopkins (PG-13, 90 minutes). Reruns, anyone?
The B-movieish television series of the mid-1960's spawns an
overblown screen version with 750 special effects, which sometimes
seem to be going on all at once. While Hopkins' direction is
gung-ho, the film has energy even when it doesn't have much sense.
It borrows from ``Star Trek,'' ``Alien'' and even ``It's a
Wonderful Life,'' but manages to remain fairly grown-up-proof just
the same. At least the stars, notably Oldman in Shakespearean
sci-fi mode, can look forward to seeing themselves as plastic
action figures from this toy-crazy extravaganza. Kids, take note:
the young hero, Will Robinson, gets to play a fancy virtual-reality
game while defending his family (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MULAN,' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B.D.
Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes).
Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping
in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but
also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This
is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films,
right down to the jokey sidekicks, would-be ``Under the Sea''
production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine
(``When will my reflection show who I am inside?'') Murphy's very
funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon
entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as
a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more
often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUT OF SIGHT,' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hardboiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon
(Maslin).

   `A PERFECT MURDER,' starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The
characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted
update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film)
``Dial M for Murder,'' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play
are icily amusing. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled,
riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader
in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover
(Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not
as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic and twinkly, is the
wife, Emily, a translator at the United Nations, who has her own
agenda. The story takes enough surprising twists to keep you
engrossed, and the high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors'
Fifth Avenue apartment) is mouthwatering (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `QUEST FOR CAMELOT,' with the voices of Andrea Carr, Gabriel
Byrne, Cary Elwes, John Gielgud, Jessalyn Gilsig, Eric Idle, Gary
Oldman, Bronson Pinchot, Don Rickles and Bryan White. Directed by
Frederik Du Chau (G, 100 minutes). Warner Brothers' shaky entrance
into the Disney-dominated sweepstakes of the musicalized animated
feature wants to be a juvenile feminist ``Lion King'' with a
musical heart that fuses ``Riverdance'' with formulaic Hollywood
gush. But its characters are too wishy-washy and visually unfocused
to be compelling, and the songs (by David Foster and Carole Bayer
Sager) so forgettable as to be extraneous. In this variation on the
Arthurian legend, a nondescript Celtic farm girl named Kayley with
aspirations to be a knight wrests the magic sword Excalibur from
the evil would-be emperor Ruber (a Hulk Hogan look-alike) and saves
the kingdom (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,' starring Anne Heche and Harrison Ford.
Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist
romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right,
putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ``From Here to
Eternity'' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are
attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a
Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as
long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the
stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up
pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In
supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms.
Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the
ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma
Hayek were in town (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITANIC,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Gloria
Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For once, a
much-touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious throwback to
the days when epic storytelling really filled the screen. Despite
the astonishing technological advances behind Cameron's great
visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the
film's central illusion, that the audience is drawn back into the
Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all
its painstaking historical detail, this ``Titanic'' proves anything
but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and
the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose
romance is skillfully interwoven with historical detail, Ms.
Winslet and DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his
``Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Cameron dared to dream of
the impossible and came up with the movie of the year (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TRUMAN SHOW,' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG,
104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and
cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top,
but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie
fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate
edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE X-FILES,' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists,
consider this: what if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania
surrounding the first ``X-Files' feature film were part of a giant
scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle?
It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If
devotees of the television series approach the film with enough
baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience
of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But
this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down, and it
remains fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And no, Scully and
Mulder don't quite take their working relationship to a higher
plane (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   FILM SERIES
</P>
<P>
   `A SPIELBERG SUMMER.' As the American Museum of the Moving Image
aptly recognizes in titling its new series, this is ``A Spielberg
Summer.'' Steven Spielberg, the filmmaker responsible for nine of
the top 25 domestic box-office hits of all time, will be
represented this summer in one capacity or another by four new
films, including ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which he directed, as
well as by ``Deep Impact,'' ``The Mask of Zorro'' and ``Small
Soldiers.'' So the time seems right for a lengthy retrospective as
well. The museum's series opens tomorrow and Sunday with screenings
at 2 p.m. of ``Jaws'' (1975) and at 5 p.m. of ``Duel'' (1971-72).
Incorporating films for which Spielberg was the director or
executive producer, the series will devote subsequent weekends to
such films as ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Back to the
Future,'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,''
``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Schindler's
List.'' Admission to ``A Spielberg Summer,'' continuing through
Sept. 6 at the museum, 34-12 36th St., at 35th Avenue, Astoria,
N.Y., is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for people over 65 and students
with ID, $4.50 for children from 5 to 18 and free to children under
4. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

ART REVIEW: ON A TRIP BACK TO FUTURISM, WOMEN AND SETTINGS MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the brief life span of the Italian Futurist
movement, the short-lived Umberto Boccioni (1882-1916) was a
blazing comet. With Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944), the poet
and critic who founded Futurism, Boccioni was a fiery theoretician
of the movement, drafting two Futurist manifestoes in 1910 and 1912
that exalted the force and energy of contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   They called for an art that glorified speed, violence and the
machine age, one that above all reflected the dynamism of an
engine-driven civilization.
</P>
<P>
   A painter with ideas, Boccioni was also the group's outstanding
sculptor. ``Boccioni and Women,'' a small show of his work from
1905 to 1916, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, makes no pretense
of giving a major account of his work. But while focusing on the
easy theme of women, it conveys the important shifts in his style
between those years. The material in the show _ drawings, prints,
one oil and one sculpture _ is from a bequest by Lydia Winston
Malbin, a dedicated Futurist collector and archivist, who died in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Right off, it can be seen that in his portrayals of women,
Boccioni was no Picasso or de Kooning. The women in his work were a
means of exploring artistic strategies, rather than his own psyche,
and his mother, sisters and neighbors as well as Ines, his
significant other, were put to decorous use as models. A 1907
etching, ``The Artist's Mother Crocheting,'' shows Boccioni as a
strong but traditional draftsman, portraying his mother in a
genteel domestic scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maria Saachi Reading,'' another etching from 1907, is also a
realistic but far more ambitious rendering of an old woman bent
raptly over a page, her rugged features, hair and clothing drawn
with a bold freedom of line and shading that evokes past masters
like Rembrandt and Durer. Still, there is an almost photographic
approach to this close-up study that puts it squarely in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he met Marinetti, in 1909, and became a member
of the Futurist circle, Boccioni was ready for a radical change of
style. His 1909 drawing, ``Woman Leaning on a Chair (the Artist's
Sister),'' already hints at the distortions, the play of angular
lines and planes adopted by the Futurists from Cubism, that he
would pursue with increasing intensity.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, in the drawing ``Analytical Study of a Woman's
Head Against Buildings'' (1911-1912), Boccioni is fully occupied
with the Futurist notion that to the mind's eye there is a constant
interplay between object and environment. In this drawing, the
blocky architecture of his mother's deliberately distorted head
segues into a helter-skelter arrangement of Cubistically broken and
dislocated building facades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, he translated his mother's head into a sculpture, his
first, and the most powerful work in the show. A bronze
appropriately called ``Antigraceful,'' it is a mass of intriguing
contradictions, melding soft fleshy facial contours with angles and
planes that create a surface as broken as a mountain terrain. The
many expressions of the face range from cheerful to menacing,
depending on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, carrying out the notion in his earlier drawing of
merging objects with their environment, the head bears the solid
form of a building amid its topknots of hair. A facescape of
imposing imagination, it was possibly influenced by the Cubism of
Picasso and Braque, and certainly by the Italian Impressionist
sculptor Medardo Rosso (1858-1928), whose flowing movement and
spareness of detail appealed to the Futurists.
</P>
<P>
   Boccioni returned to painting after a stint in the Army, where
he served, with other Futurists, on the Italian front in World War
I. The forward thrust of Futurism was all but over, and his new
style was much closer to Cezanne's. His ``Head of the Artist's
Mother,'' a pen-and-ink drawing of 1915, is Cezannesque in its
stripped-down forms; the almost featureless visage, all bulges and
hollows, is the skin and bones of a face but not much more.
Recalled to military service in 1916, Boccioni was fatally injured
in a fall from a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of Boccioni's women is a rather lightweight
premise, this small, compact show, organized by Sabine Rewald of
the Met's department of 20th-century art, whets the appetite for a
full-scale Boccioni retrospective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Boccioni and Women'' remains at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, through Oct. 18.

WITH `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,' LYLE LOVETT CONTINUES HIS DRIFT TOWARD
FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Texans are having breakfast with screenwriter-director Don
Roos when Roos asks them to explain the difference between Dallas
and Fort Worth. One of the Texans is Lyle Lovett, so it seems best
to defer to him.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett, having just polished off a plate of huevos rancheros,
gives the standard line: Fort Worth is old cattle culture, Dallas
is new money. But then, Lovett waxes nostalgic:
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, wanting to be a cowboy, which is the way things
are when you're a kid in Texas, Fort Worth was a mythical place,''
the lanky singer-actor says. ``The cattle drives and all that. So I
remember coming to Dallas and getting to go to Fort Worth for the
first time when I was 10 years old. I just thought it was a big
deal, wow. Flew in an airplane for the first time, to Love Field,
on my 10th birthday. ... Getting to go to Cowtown and getting to
drive around the Stockyards was a very big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth is more cosmopolitan these days, but then, so is
Lovett. Still, he remains as synonymous with Texas as ... well, as
Fort Worth. He even looks Texan in Roos' new movie, ``The Opposite
of Sex,'' although it's set in Indiana, Canada and California
(where it was filmed). In the movie, Lovett plays Carl, a
gentle-natured sheriff who favors boots and Wranglers. Although the
part wasn't written specifically for Lovett, Roos acknowledges that
Carl has a certain Lyle-ness about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet he has a few of your albums,'' Roos says to Lovett. ``I
needed somebody substantial _ kind of like rugged, decent, American
to play this part ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``... And he couldn't find anybody, so he let me do it,'' Lovett
interjects.
</P>
<P>
   For Lovett, interruptions such as this are rare. He is
unfailingly polite, with quick, crooked smiles and compassionate
eyes that put those around him at ease. Still a singer first, he's
becoming more and more linked to movies, whether through songs
(he's on the soundtrack to ``Hope Floats'') or appearances (a cameo
in ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,'' a role in Robert Altman's
upcoming ``Cookie's Fortune''). Since appearing in Altman's ``The
Player,'' his stature as an actor has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't have many scenes in ``Sex,'' the movie gives
Lovett his biggest role yet. Roos' decidedly politically incorrect
comedy centers on a trashy blonde named Dedee (Christina Ricci),
who moves in with her gay half-brother, seduces his lover,
convinces the lover that they should get married because she's
pregnant, and runs away with the lover and some valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone in the movie pursues her, although Carl is
more interested in the romantic pursuit of a sexually repressed
schoolteacher (''Friends''' Lisa Kudrow).
</P>
<P>
   Roos, who also wrote ``Single White Female'' and ``Boys on the
Side,'' is taking his first directing turn on ``The Opposite of
Sex.'' He says that Lovett didn't even have to read for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyle came down for a meeting, and I thought he was auditioning
us, because I was a first-time director,'' Roos says. ``So (I was)
like, `OK, OK, everyone, he's coming, he's coming! All right, we'll
be cool!'''
</P>
<P>
   Lovett has spent much of this year working on a new CD, which is
due in September (a fall tour will follow, with a Fort Worth-Dallas
date likely). The album is a collection of 21 songs written by
Texas singer-songwriters, including four by the late Townes Van
Zandt, a Fort Worth native.
</P>
<P>
   ``Townes was like a spirit in life, and he was so insightful,''
says Lovett, who sang at Van Zandt's funeral. ``He talked about his
songs being `sky songs.' They would come out of the sky and just go
into his arm and into his guitar. He was a mysterious guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Lovett's not-quite-country, not-quite-pop music is hard
to categorize, it isn't as prevalent on the radio as George Strait
or Garth Brooks. But he credits Dallas' KERA/90.1 FM and Poor
David's Pub for early career support, and he has frequently used
Fort Worth's Caravan of Dreams as a rehearsal venue before touring.
Some singers might be bitter about the lack of airplay; Lovett
prefers to be grateful for the support he does get.
</P>
<P>
   He also prefers not to be bitter about something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like a Julia question,'' Roos says after listening
to an apologetic preface. ``I've been (touring) with him now long
enough to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a question about Lovett's short-lived marriage to
actress Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the questions that can get you in trouble, it's the
answers,'' Lovett says, adding that he and Roberts are still good
friends, despite what supermarket tabloids would have you believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would actually be very easy for tabloids to get things
right a lot of the time, and they'll concoct a story that, even if
it's innocuous, it's inaccurate,'' says Lovett, who was a
journalism student at Texas A&AMP;M University. But ``you can't dismiss
it as something that only a small part of the public is interested
in, because they make a lot of money for what they do. And that's
what gives them credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids probably wouldn't look twice at Lovett's home life
now. When he's not working, he lives next door to his parents, in
his grandparents' house on a farm outside of Houston. He remains
close to his family, and visits with them as much as time allows.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether he'll break out of supporting movie roles and take
a lead part, Lovett says that's not his ambition, but he'll take
the right role if it comes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he says. ``It's great film school to be in a
movie and to work with smart and talented people and who are the
best at what they do. It's really great. How that will settle out
later on _ who knows?''

ART REVIEW: A DANE WHO TURNED COPENHAGEN AND NATURE INTO STILL
LIFES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe it's just an accident of scheduling, or a sign
of cultural downtime at the end of a decade of intense and
challenging art. But Manhattan's high-profile museums are offering
a confluence of deeply conservative fare this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Wyeth holds center stage at the Whitney Museum of
American Art, Pierre Bonnard at the Museum of Modern Art. At the
Metropolitan Museum, Edward Burne-Jones follows hard on the heels
of two 18th-century French academics. The lineup has many agreeable
features, but a kind of self-protective reverie is the defining
mode: nostalgia hanging like a perfume in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vilhelm Hammershoi (1864-1916): Danish Painter of Solitude and
Light'' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum sustains this trend.
Hammershoi was born in Copenhagen, worked and died there, and made
it his primary subject. And his art seems to be pervaded by the
hunkered-down atmosphere of that northern European city in
mid-winter.
</P>
<P>
   In that season, daylight lasts only a few hours and has a
muffled radiance. Natural light _ slanting through a window,
gleaming from polished furniture or from a gilded picture frame _
takes on a kind of precious, metaphorical weight. The domestic
interior becomes a refuge and a universe, protective,
claustrophobic, self-contained.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hammershoi's paintings are of such interiors,
specifically the Copenhagen apartment he shared with his wife, Ida.
One can guess at a glance that the couple had no children: this is
an adult domain, furnished with self-conscious austerity,
immaculately clean, blanketed (or so it seems) in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hammershoi was a shut-in. He was an artist of
considerable renown in his day, and much of his art is that of a
public man. The show _ organized by Anne-Birgitte Fonsmark and
Mikael Wivel of the Ordrupgaard museum in Copenhagen, Henri
Loyrette of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris and Robert Rosenblum of the
Guggeheim _ includes several of his paintings of the exteriors of
Copenhagen buildings, as well as depictions of the surrounding
countryside where he vacationed and of European cities that he
regularly visited.
</P>
<P>
   Landscapes are, in fact, among the earliest paintings in the
show, and the most luxuriant and lyrical. In a near-abstract image
of a farmhouse, for example, the whitewashed wall, the dark
thatched roof and a green hedge are rendered as horizontal layers,
like folds of soft cloth. And a painting of a line of trees
dividing a band of lake water from a big patch of rain-soaked sky
has the ornamental elegance of a fabric pattern.
</P>
<P>
   There are no figures in these scenes. Nor do any appear in the
city paintings, in which Copenhagen's facades suggest architectural
renderings, entirely about measurement and line. The Baroque front
of the Asiatic Company is as flat as a cutout; the Old
Christiansborg Palace, filtered through sea mist, is plain and
blank, like a design for a mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   In Hammershoi's hands, as in Morandi's and Mondrian's, the world
becomes a still life: a narrow assortment of set components that
can be endlessly rearranged but that harbor no disquieting
surprises. This is particularly true of his paintings of interiors,
by far his most original works, where the human figure is permitted
to play a carefully controlled role.
</P>
<P>
   The figure depicted is usually Ida, seen in the apartment at 30
Standgade where they lived for several years. The walls of the
rooms are painted a dove gray (which the Guggenheim installation
echoes); doors, wainscoting and windows are white. The furniture is
sparse but fine: a dining room table with a crisp, creased white
cloth, a ponderous cabinet sofa, a sideboard carrying a ceramic
tureen with a floral pattern.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the rooms are clutter-free, they feel smothered
and static, in part because nothing is happening in them. Ida is
there in a plain black dress and bathed in wan, indirect sunlight.
(Hammershoi's love of Vermeer is often noted by scholars.) But
whether reading or standing still, she is viewed impersonally, as
if she were a prop, an extra piece of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get a sense of how the artist related to her. This
is true even of a double portrait from 1898 in which she and
Hammershoi appear together. Ida sits at the table, looking toward
the viewer, but down and away. Her hand, with its glinting gold
wedding ring, rests in front of her; her expression is mute. But
here her dress is amazing: it is colored a gorgeous, inscrutably
complex moss green and molded, through a network of tiny brush
strokes, to the shape of her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The result is literally, physically, a loving image. Yet the
artist himself, sitting across the table from her, barely seems to
be in the picture at all. He is a silhouette over to the right,
faced away, so one cannot tell where his gaze actually falls. Is he
staring at his wife in reticent admiration? Or at something on the
table?
</P>
<P>
   The few other bust-length portraits of Ida are equally striking.
In one back view, she wears a velvety blouse whose puckers and
pleats and stress lines are sensually suggestive. In a later, Van
Eyckian picture, her expression is slightly frazzled and skeptical
as she absent-mindedly dips a spoon in a white porcelain cup. She's
facing front here and for once doing something homey and specific,
but she still seems just as boxed in as she does in the rooms whose
doors, moldings and framed pictures form a relentless, exhausting
geometry.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years of his life, before he died of cancer at
51, Hammershoi turned to different subjects, including the female
nude. There's an early example in the show, a grisaille figure with
a voluptuous body and a demure child's face. And while the standing
figures from the end of his career are larger, they look, with one
exception, unresolved and awkward, as if the painter wanted an
effect of monumental intimacy but wasn't quite sure how to achieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the real intimacy of Hammershoi's work lies less
in what he painted than in how he painted. His grayed-down colors
may not look like colors, but they are, and they have a kind of
secretive, confiding presence. They range from silvery
Whistleresque beiges to faint roses, saffrons and blues that
whisper just below the surface. And the surfaces themselves are
texturally alive, energy fields of visual incident created through
short, restless, caressing strokes.
</P>
<P>
   This touch gives Hammershoi's paintings a distinctive pulse,
though it is the slow, energy-conserving pulse of a cold-weather
metabolism, very different from the excited, urbane beat of French
modernism. Hammershoi, who visited Paris, was familiar with
Impressionism and Symbolism, but dismissed their bright palettes
and antinaturalist styles with angry derision (so did Burne-Jones),
much as his wife deplored the cosmetic extravagances of Parisian
belles.
</P>
<P>
   So he kept to his narrow groove, and looked backward rather than
forward, to the 17th-century Dutch and the early Italians, to
19th-century Danish forebears like Christen Kobke and the romantic
German painter Caspar David Friedrich. And he looked inward rather
than outward, which is what gives him a claim on our attention.
</P>
<P>
   The show's catalog compares him to Edward Hopper, which is
plausible, though Andrew Wyeth isn't far away. Is there any real
difference between Hammershoi's ``Dust Motes Dancing in the
Sunbeams'' (1900) and one of Wyeth's Maine farmhouse interiors
washed with winter light? Both images traffic in a melancholy sense
of the ephemeral, a naturalism of nostalgia, emotions easy to feel
and easy to feel good about feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But Hammershoi's paintings come across not as illustrations of
emotions, but as embodiments of the real, weird thing, the
components of a personal fantasy, a softly hallucinatory fiction,
the pictorial equivalent of the desire to shut the door and draw
the curtain against the clamor of the new and the different, all
the generative disharmonies of life out there. One could say the
same of Burne-Jones, Bonnard and even Wyeth. And why these artists
have landed together in our midst just now may be a question worth
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vilhelm Hammershoi (1864-1916): Danish Painter of Solitude and
Light'' remains at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth
Ave., at 89th Street, through Sept. 7. Financing was provided by
the Danish Ministry of Culture and Novo Nordisk.

CAR COLLECTING: ON THE ROAD WITH AN E-TYPE JAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VINCENT DE PAUL O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose you fulfill your fantasy and actually buy a classic car,
say a 1969 E-Type Jaguar roadster. What in the world would you do
with it?
</P>
<P>
   What if you cast prudence and all reason aside, hint at
adventure to a dear photographer friend and drive it cross-country
_ some 10,000 miles in 39 days? Cover 21 states, eight national
parks and four big cities. And while you're at it, endure five
breakdowns (the car's, not your own). After all, it is a '60s Jag,
a finicky breed of cat that many Americans love to look at, whether
it is tearing down the road or sitting on the shoulder waiting for
a tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   I had expected breakdowns when I set out last summer from Long
Island, with an itinerary that included stops in Seattle, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nev. But there were two
fascinating developments I had not anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the car's reception, or more accurately its lack
of one, between the coasts. It has always turned heads, thousands
of them, in New York, and was enthusiastically received in San
Francisco and Los Angeles. But in the 3,000 miles in between it
didn't cause much of a stir. In Buhl, Idaho, conversations were
more likely to center on the price of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The second was altitude sickness _ not mine, the car's. Out
West, everyone knows about the horrible effects of altitude on the
fuel and air mixture in older cars, which have no computers to
steady performance and only a limited range of adjustments. But I
didn't know that, and the ascent to the northeast entrance of
Yellowstone from Montana, the snaking Bear Tooth Pass (elevation
10,947 feet), was our first indication that we wouldn't hear the
engine run evenly again till we were at sea level in California. I
replaced the spark plugs four times during mountainous passages and
cleaned the carbon off the plugs' tips about every other day.
</P>
<P>
   Until I began to prepare for the trip, the car was just the way
it was made 29 years ago. To increase the low odds of a successful
journey, a guru of classic Jags, Mark Thornton of Sayville, N.Y.,
replaced the antiquated points and condenser with a relatively
new-to-the-market electronic ignition that fit in the same space.
He also added a computerized gizmo called a multiple spark
discharge box, which provides a significantly stronger jolt of
juice to the spark plugs, followed microseconds later with smaller
jolts _ the effect being virtually complete fuel combustion. In
essence, more oomph. The spark plug wires and the coil were
upgraded commensurately, the figuring being that the ignition
system posed the greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   When I left last June, Thornton was restoring a 1961 Jaguar Mark
II sedan for his wife. He suggested that I pack a spare alternator
and, gesturing toward his wife's car, added, ``I wouldn't even take
that car cross-country after I'm done with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After that less-than-ringing commentary on my plans, I loaded
the trunk with spares, but no alternator, since mine had been
rebuilt the year before. The alternator was the third thing to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the little sensor in the radiator that tells the
cooling fans to turn on. It quit on a steep grade at the beginning
of the Teton Pass just past Jackson, Wyo., and was the only failure
I was actually prepared for. The fans in my car are wired two ways,
one that worked off the sensor, like all other E-types, and one
that overrode it though a switch on the dashboard. If you change
the connections on a few wires, presto, the fans work. But you have
to remember to turn them on manually, and I will not recount here
the number of times I forgot.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was grand, with stops at the Badlands, Mount Rushmore,
Crazy Horse Mountain and Little Big Horn. Then came the altitude
sickness, starting at Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest trouble came after leaving Crater Lake National
Park in Oregon, when I heard a snapping noise behind me. Poking
around on the side of the road, I found that two of the 72 spokes
in the left rear wire wheel had broken. Further poking revealed a
broken cotter pin in the wheel bearing. Without that pin, a nut
slowly loosens and the wheel comes off, which is what was in the
process of happening. The stress from the loose wheel had snapped
the spokes. Using the spare wheel and a borrowed nail bent to work
like a cotter pin, we were back on the road; I found a replacement
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The alternator started squeaking near Crescent City in Northern
California, though the voltmeter on the dashboard indicated that it
was still putting out enough current to keep the car going. When
the squeak became a screech 80 miles later in Eureka, a phone call
to an alternator rebuilder another 120 miles away in Ukiah
persuaded me to push on, based on his guess that he could fix it.
He couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The next hope was in San Francisco, 120 miles to the south. The
alternator, by then howling for a warm spot in the junk yard sun,
made it. But if you've never traveled in the dark and the fog on
Highway 101, a succession of hairpin turns, you might not want to
add to your agitation by wondering whether you could manage it
without handy accessories like headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Several San Francisco shops actually had the correct rebuilt
alternator, and one was near the 49-mile scenic trail that many
tourists follow to see the city. So we picked up the new
alternator, I installed it in the street, and we spent the rest of
the day driving the trail.
</P>
<P>
   On the way down the coast we stopped in San Luis Obispo at XK's
Unlimited, a renowned rebuilder of classic Jaguars. While I ogled
their collection they retuned my carburetors for sea level,
straightening out the mess I had made of them along the way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lengthiest delay began when one of the rear shock absorbers
collapsed with startling suddenness not far from Zion National Park
in southern Utah, falling into the rear brake rotor and making an
awful metal-on-metal racket.
</P>
<P>
   There are four rear shocks on many Jags, not the traditional
two, and they are twinned, two on each side. After getting a tow 30
miles to Kanab, where the broken pieces were pulled out, we decided
that nothing would stop us from seeing the wonders of Grand Canyon
and Bryce Canyon National Parks, so we pressed on. It was great for
us, but too much to ask of the working twin, which sagged until the
car listed badly to port. It took two unscheduled days and nights
in Panguitch, Utah, before XK's Unlimited could ship replacements
to St. George, Utah, and a delivery service could get them the
remaining 90 miles. I installed them and headed East.
</P>
<P>
   But not before one last crisis. The down-pipe portion of the
exhaust system, which started the trip with an innocent little
leak, fractured on Interstate 70 on the way to Denver. After
fastening a clamp to the broken pipe, and electrical wire to the
clamp to tie it close to its original position, we roared over the
Rockies, sounding like a pack of Harley-Davidsons. The next day,
the local Midas dealer fabricated a new pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jaguar aficionados say I've set a record for trip distance
in this country in a classic E-Type, but they offer no hard
evidence. I've decided to ignore the lack of documentation and
claim a world record.
</P>
<P>
   Will I ever do something like this again? The sights were
magnificent, so of course. But next time I'll start by flying to
Denver and renting a younger car.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jumbo Atwell never stopped laughing.
</P>
<P>
   And even now, in his own way, Ben Dodson Atwell, a former
longtime state representative from Dallas and chairman of the House
tax committee, is getting the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Atwell was buried Thursday in the state cemetery beneath a
tombstone of his own design _ a pink granite, Texas-shaped marker
bearing his name and the inscription ``Lawyer-Legislator. Author of
tax bill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Atwell's remedy to an oversight of which he often
complained _ the dearth of monuments honoring tax men.
</P>
<P>
   Atwell, a robust man who stood 6-foot-3 and at his peak weighed
300 pounds, died Monday in Austin at age 82.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this,'' his daughter, Sandi Purdy of Dallas,
observed, ``he lived his way, and he never missed an opportunity to
have a good time. He absolutely was one of the ones who enjoyed
life to its fullest and never missed a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was,'' added Bay City state Rep. Tom Uher, ``the oldest
teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Atwell, a Hutchins native who chaired the crucial
House Revenue and Taxation Committee for 12 years, was eulogized as
a man of ``courage, leadership and humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members of the Legislature would scurry away from a tax
bill like mice in front of a flock of cats,'' said former state
Sen. Carl Parker of Port Arthur. ``Jumbo had the courage to carry
these bills at a time when the state badly needed the revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have the level of education, law enforcement or
social services we have if it weren't for him. He made the world a
better place for having lived in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwell's funeral, which began with recorded Willie Nelson tunes,
was a blend of solemnity and humor.
</P>
<P>
   His body, attired in a boldly patterned orange, black and white
shirt, lay in a mahogany coffin draped with a Texas flag. Nearby
was a stand holding a ceramic bust of the lawmaker, which, in turn
was topped with a fuzzy cowboy hat with rattlesnake skin band,
complete with rattles. Dangling from the statue's neck was an
oversized, red, white and blue necktie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to correct an error that's been appearing in the
obituaries,'' Parker told those gathered at Austin's Weed Corley
Fish Funeral Home. ``Jumbo wasn't 82 years old, he was 164. He just
did it quicker than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Atwell's other key achievements in the House _ where he
served more than two decades beginning in 1951 _ was his promotion
of a bill authorizing Dallas and Tarrant counties to create the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's serious business aside, Atwell's former
colleagues this week recalled him for his bonhomie, describing him
as a larger-than-life figure in an era when serving the state was _
in former House Speaker Gib Lewis' words _ ``fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man who prided himself on being a `character,''' said
Bob Slagle, former state Democratic Party chairman, who knew Atwell
in the 1960s. ``He had a wonderful time. He wasn't going to be
bored. He liked to tell jokes, be loud and have something to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of a fun guy, a roguish type of cat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atwell himself often allowed that he ``voted with the
conservatives and partied with the liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy, Atwell's daughter, recalled the time her father lampooned
the House of Representatives' strict coat-and-tie dress code by
arriving for a session attired in a plaid sport coat with a
5-foot-long red, white and blue necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Others remembered Atwell's outlandish Cadillac, the hood of
which was shadowed fender to fender by an enormous set of steer
horns.
</P>
<P>
   Though at one point deemed the ``dean'' of the Dallas County
delegation, Atwell rarely lived in his district, preferring the
livelier environs of the capital city, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me one time that he never wanted to live in Dallas,''
she said. ``Said he never wanted to be cold again. He loved South
Texas, especially Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumbo was a party fellow, but he was dependable and honest,''
said former Harris County state Sen. Chet Brooks. ``If he said he'd
vote with you, he'd be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew he could turn off the frivolity, the
devil-may-care attitude and be very serious when focusing on the
issues he was working on,'' added Uher, who served on Atwell's tax
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks recalled a Republican juggernaut of the early '60s that
ousted the entire Dallas delegation with the exception of Atwell.
Shortly afterward, Atwell received a bristling telegram from an
irate Republican physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a searing telegram,'' Brooks said. ``The guy did
everything wrong in making a political contact. He said he was a
Republican leader in Dallas who hadn't voted for him last time and
wouldn't support him next time. Meanwhile, he said Jumbo should
vote this, this and this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Jumbo, how are you going to answer this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumbo said, `That's simple. I sent him a telegram: Screw you.
Nasty letter to follow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumbo had a great sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brooks remembered that Atwell lived in a building jocularly
called the ``Playboy Club,'' that was half apartment, half bar. The
veteran Harris County legislator still recalls a party at the
Playboy that featured the remarkably well-preserved Miss Wool of
1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was still a looker,'' Brooks said. ``Jumbo loved beauty.
He loved people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atwell's former colleagues agreed that he was a product of his
time and place, a creature of a freewheeling, old boys' legislative
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the pleasure to serve in state government when it was
fun,'' said Lewis, who was among Atwell's pallbearers. ``You could
curse, say what you wanted, without having the press haunt you for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I called it `The Big Top,''' recalled Mississippi author
Willie Morris, who then edited the Texas Observer, a liberal
political journal.
</P>
<P>
   Morris vividly recalled a free-for-all on the House floor during
debate of a sales tax bill authored by Atwell and former state Rep.
Charlie Wilson, who later went on to become a longtime U.S.
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were wrestling in the aisles,'' Morris said. ``Some of
the secretaries were, too. Back then, secretaries sat next to the
legislators. The barbershop quartet, made up of four legislators _
it was like the orchestra on the Titanic _ they got up to sing
songs to quell the riot. I remember someone pulled the PA system
out.''

<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Former Texas Observer publisher Ronnie Dugger characterized the
Legislature of those years as ``wild and wooly like the Wild West.
(It was) a wild, disreputable scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were simpler times,'' Brooks observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the stress is impossible. I don't think Jumbo would have
wanted to stay in it.''

of a bill authorizing Dallas and Tarrant counties to create the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's serious business aside, Atwell's former
colleagues this week recalled him for his bonhomie, describing him
as a larger-than-life figure in an era when serving the state was _
in former House Speaker Gib Lewis' words _ ``fun.''

   ``He was a man who prided himself on being a `character,''' said
Bob Slagle, former state Democratic Party chairman, who knew Atwell
in the 1960s. ``He had a wonderful time. He wasn't going to be
bored. He liked to tell jokes, be loud and have something to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of a fun guy, a roguish type of cat.''

<P>
   Atwell himself often allowed that he ``voted with the
conservatives and partied with the liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy, Atwell's daughter, recalled the time her father lampooned
the House of Representatives' strict coat-and-tie dress code by
arriving for a session attired in a plaid sport coat with a
5-foot-long red, white and blue necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Others remembered Atwell's outlandish Cadillac, the hood of
which was shadowed fender to fender by an enormous set of steer
horns.
</P>
<P>
   Though at one point deemed the ``dean'' of the Dallas County
delegation, Atwell rarely lived in his district, preferring the
livelier environs of the capital city, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me one time that he never wanted to live in Dallas,''
she said. ``Said he never wanted to be cold again. He loved South
Texas, especially Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumbo was a party fellow, but he was dependable and honest,''
said former Harris County state Sen. Chet Brooks. ``If he said he'd
vote with you, he'd be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew he could turn off the frivolity, the
devil-may-care attitude and be very serious when focusing on the
issues he was working on,'' added Uher, who served on Atwell's tax
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks recalled a Republican juggernaut of the early '60s that
ousted the entire Dallas delegation with the exception of Atwell.
Shortly afterward, Atwell received a bristling telegram from an
irate Republican physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a searing telegram,'' Brooks said. ``The guy did
everything wrong in making a political contact. He said he was a
Republican leader in Dallas who hadn't voted for him last time and
wouldn't support him next time. Meanwhile, he said Jumbo should
vote this, this and this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Jumbo, how are you going to answer this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumbo said, `That's simple. I sent him a telegram: Screw you.
Nasty letter to follow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumbo had a great sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Brooks remembered that Atwell lived in a building jocularly
called the ``Playboy Club,'' that was half apartment, half bar. The
veteran Harris County legislator still recalls a party at the
Playboy that featured the remarkably well-preserved Miss Wool of
1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was still a looker,'' Brooks said. ``Jumbo loved beauty.
He loved people.''

<P>
   Atwell's former colleagues agreed that he was a product of his
time and place, a creature of a freewheeling, old boys' legislative
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the pleasure to serve in state government when it was
fun,'' said Lewis, who was among Atwell's pallbearers. ``You could
curse, say what you wanted, without having the press haunt you for
life.''

   ``I called it `The Big Top,''' recalled Mississippi author
Willie Morris, who then edited the Texas Observer, a liberal

<P>
   Morris vividly recalled a free-for-all on the House floor during
debate of a sales tax bill authored by Atwell and former state Rep.
Charlie Wilson, who later went on to become a longtime U.S.
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were wrestling in the aisles,'' Morris said. ``Some of
the secretaries were, too. Back then, secretaries sat next to the
legislators. The barbershop quartet, made up of four legislators _
it was like the orchestra on the Titanic _ they got up to sing
songs to quell the riot. I remember someone pulled the PA system
out.''

   Former Texas Observer publisher Ronnie Dugger characterized the
Legislature of those years as ``wild and wooly like the Wild West.
(It was) a wild, disreputable scene.''

   ``Those were simpler times,'' Brooks observed.

<P>
   ``Now the stress is impossible. I don't think Jumbo would have
wanted to stay in it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The holiday weekend will begin sunny and warm with comfortable
humidity over the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states. Gentle
winds will allow sea breezes to develop, keeping the coast
noticeably cooler than the interior. Meanwhile, a very weak
disturbance will encourage afternoon puffy clouds over parts of New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary separating this pleasant air mass from sultry air
over the South will provide the focus for batches of showers and
thunderstorms from the Southeast Coast to the middle Mississippi
Valley. Most of the storms will develop along and on the humid side
of the front. Most of Florida will remain parched, though a shower
is possible across the south. Wildfires will continue to ravage
northern parts of the state. Meanwhile, tropical downpours will
spiral into the western Gulf states as a disturbance presses
westward.
</P>
<P>
   A potent cold front will slice through the upper Middle West.
Ahead of the front, hot, sticky air will erupt with showers and
thunderstorms. Supercell thunderstorms capable of producing
isolated tornadoes are possible from Nebraska to Illinois, though
high wind gusts and hail will be the primary threat.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a jet stream disturbance will cause pockets of
showers and isolated thunder across the interior Northwest. Fog
will persist much of the day at the coast. Thunder will develop
over the Rockies Friday afternoon, as the mountain peaks provide an
elevated source of heat for rising air currents. The Southwest will
be sunny and seasonably hot, while coastal fog yields to afternoon
sun in California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Heat Low
</P>
<P>
   A heat low induced showers and thunderstorms across parts of
interior Alaska early Thursday. A heat low is a pocket of weak,
shallow low pressure that forms when the density of low-level air
decreases in response to high temperatures. This week, readings
soared toward 90 degrees over interior Alaska, leading to an island
of very warm, light air whose barometric pressure was lower than
the surrounding sea of cooler air. Air converging around the low
rose into the atmosphere, setting the stage for thunderstorms. A
flash-flood watch was posted for a region northwest of Fairbanks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALKEETNA, Alaska _ The cemetery in this risk-lover's domain
should be enough to keep most people from trying to stand atop the
High One, or Denali, as Athabascan Indians call Mount McKinley. The
climbers came from all over the world, drawn to the highest peak in
North America, and they ended up with their names on granite here _
118 dead over the last 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no sense of horror or defeat in the summer shadows.
After nearly a monthlong disappearance behind a cloak of mist and
storms, the mountain is out _ a hulk of rock and luminous ice
pressing the upper reaches of the Alaskan sky at 20,320 feet.
</P>
<P>
   So, even though three people have died so far this climbing
season, McKinley is more of a lure than ever before. Just outside
the cemetery in this village in south-central Alaska, about 50
miles southeast of Mount McKinley, bush planes fly away with fresh
loads of climbers setting out to begin a three-week haul from base
camp at 7,000 feet to the top of one of the world's most demanding
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, McKinley, the heart of Denali National
Park and Preserve, was a comparatively lonely place. Its reputation
for foul weather _ even in the summer, the upper slopes can be
gripped in wind-chill temperatures that are well below zero _ deep
crevasses in the glacial ice, and a need for slow-moving,
military-like ascents kept all but the most obsessive away.
</P>
<P>
   But since the mid-1980s, the number of climbers have doubled.
And this year, McKinley is likely to set a record, with more than
1,300 people trying to reach the summit. It was always a trophy
mountain. But it is even more so now, when there is a worldwide
fascination with mountaineering.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a 12-year-old boy became the youngest person to
climb the mountain. The boy, Kim Yong Sik, a South Korean who was
with a party that included his father, made the summit by the
popular West Buttress route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear trouble when I hear something like that,'' said Daryl
R. Miller, the chief climbing ranger at the park. Miller is in
charge of rescue operations; he keeps track of all climbing
accidents, and he has climbed McKinley numerous times over the last
15 years as a volunteer, a guide and a ranger.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Miller worries that some people will lose
respect for Mount McKinley. ``This mountain does not
discriminate,'' he said. ``If you look at all the accidents _ and
that's what I do for a living _ you see that the common factor is
weather, not experience level.''
</P>
<P>
   He scanned a list of fatalities from the last seven years. Under
the heading of cause, several reasons came up repeatedly: cold,
wind, frostbite, avalanche, dehydration, hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   A board inside the ranger headquarters here keeps track of all
the attempts to reach the summit. On average, 50 percent of all
climbers make the top. This year, the success rate is only 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deaths this year was an experienced member of a
rescue team; another was a mountaineering guide from Washington
state. A British military team with years of experience nearly lost
all their members in a fall; they were plucked by helicopter about
1,400 feet from the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service does not screen people for experience
or common sense. Climbers pay $150, register 60 days in advance,
then are left on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't play God,'' Miller said. ``We just have to hope
people understand what the risks are.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But as Miller shakes his head while wondering what the news of a
12-year-old climbing the tallest mountain in North America will
mean, climbers all around him at the ranger station chatter away in
the international language of challenge. There are teams of
mountaineers from Japan, Russia, France _ all of them raccoon-eyed
from spending weeks in the intense ultraviolet light of McKinley's
high glacier slopes.
</P>
<P>
   And there are people who say the mountain has become too
crowded, with too many people on a lark. ``I'm not going up there
anymore _ there are too many intellectuals,'' said Adrian Nature,
who just returned from nearly a month on McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Nature, a resident of Salt Lake City, has been on McKinley 14
times, he said, but now he seems disgusted by the new popularity of
high-alpine mountaineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that Jon Krakauer book,'' Nature said, referring ``Into
Thin Air,'' Krakauer's best-selling book about the disastrous 1996
climbing season on Mount Everest. ``There are so many people up
there now, it's disgusting. People don't take the time to learn
what this mountain is all about. They don't know what this mountain
can dish out.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other veteran climbers, Nature complained about the
``traffic jam'' of people _ literally hundreds of climbers in the
higher base camps above 14,000 feet _ snaking their way to the top.
Still, he may change his mind and return again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' he said. ``Because I love it. Because it is Denali, and
there is no other place like it in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of the early McKinley adventurers felt the same way.
Don Sheldon, perhaps the most famous bush pilot in Alaskan history,
opened numerous routes on McKinley and plucked many a frostbitten
climber from the mountain's icy flanks.
</P>
<P>
   After all the derring do, all the whiteouts, the slips and
falls, the uncertain steps into dark clouds, Sheldon died, in 1975,
of something that can strike people who seldom leave their couches
except to pick up the television remote _ cancer. He is buried in
the cemetery here, his ice ax embedded in stone. On the grave are
these words: ``He wagered with the wind and won.''

(Mindy Aloff is the dance critic for The New Republic.) 
 By MINDY ALOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the annual Midsummer Night Swing festival, which
ingeniously presents world music in the context of an outdoor
ballroom on the Lincoln Center Plaza each summer, Rebecca Weller,
the founding producer, will fly halfway around the globe to hear
bands recommended by her trusted network of connoisseurs. Once she
finds the bands, however, she sometimes has to convince them that
playing for dancers is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to educate a lot of musicians about doing this,'' she
said, speaking as someone trained in classical piano. ``When
musicians get to a certain level, they sometimes don't want to play
for dancers. It's below them. Yet I'm so passionate about it
because it's music in a most exciting form. At a good dance, people
are in each other's arms having a good time, and they want to stay
there.''
</P>
<P>
   From the sights and sounds of things, the salsa evening during
the opening week of the festival, which began on June 24, qualified
as a good dance. Music was provided by the 21-piece Puerto Rican
orchestra El Gran Combo, an outfit more than 40 years old that
still drives dancers to plant little kisses on their partners every
so often. This is while dancing in a style requiring so much body
English in the neck, shoulders and hips that the kisses become a
form of lip reading.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night one could see vibrant interpretations of the
salsa, a strutting dance with odd, syncopated waits that Stacey
Lopez of the University of Puerto Rico had taught at a
preperformance lesson. There was an aerobic double-time version,
where both dancers took two steps to each musical count.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Jell-O-on-springs version, where the large joints
of the body rotated twice as fast as every step taken. There was
the ``I'm Princess Grace and he's Cary Grant'' version, marked by
balletic precision, head-snapping turns and a refrigerator's worth
of distance between partners.
</P>
<P>
   There was a solo ``I'm waiting for my girlfriend, who's late''
version, where a guy (preferably in a Panama hat) loosens up alone
in a fantastical vortex of competing rhythms throughout his body.
There was the Palladium mambo version, with fireworks in the legs
for the woman and existential hesitations for the man, who was so
tightly sprung he seemed to be imploding in place.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the version practiced by a pair of 20-year-olds
named Alejandro Sierra and Marguerita Stofan. The effect of this
one depended in part on Ms. Stofan's costume: sandals with
four-inch-high heels, a tailored suit with a miniskirt that bared
her legs for about the length of a city block and a hip-length
jacket that swung outward demurely.
</P>
<P>
   When Sierra went to partner Ms. Stofan, he placed his right hand
on her waist in an orthodox salsa position. But to reach her waist,
he had to insinuate his hand between her jacket and her blouse, so
the look of the hold from a distance was so formal and so intimate,
so cool and so hot, that within about 10 minutes Sierra had to cede
Ms. Stofan to a bevy of new suitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of this festival,'' Ms. Weller said, ``is to
present high-caliber music that also fits the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   What are the rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``My guideline is that the music has to swing, an indefinable
word, but still. And that goes for a merengue, a beguine or a
two-step. For dancers, you can't have long horn solos to take you
out of tempo, for example. A five-minute solo takes people out of
tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weller's rules create the climate for certain kinds of dance
music, especially the kind conducive to steps and figures more
demanding than sheer rhythmic improvisation. For young American
clubgoers, who grew up with a rock-influenced dance called
``nouvelle generation'' compas in New York, the music of Haiti's
L'Orchestre Septentrional, scheduled to play Friday night, may be
something rather new.
</P>
<P>
   Septentrional, which is celebrating its golden anniversary as a
dance band this year, specializes in the Haitian k'onpa, from which
the word compas is derived. An ensemble of some 25 musicians, with
a large complement of brass players, it offers complex and courtly
arrangements of music to accompany a dance that will be taught
before the performance by Nadia Dieudonne.
</P>
<P>
   The k'onpa is a swaying two-step, related like many Caribbean
dances to marching, and capturing a bit of Haiti's complex history
in its traces of African rhythms and European contredanse patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Septentrional's appearance at the festival is special. The band,
which still includes some of its founding musicians now in their
70s, doesn't travel easily in its entirety and when members have
toured in the New York area, they have performed exclusively for
Haitian communities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, one of Ms. Weller's regular consultants, the disk
jockey and radio interviewer Al Angeloro (who has written that his
``love of Afro-Cuban and Caribbean rhythms borders on an
obsession''), took her to Hempstead, N.Y., for a rare appearance by
the full band.
</P>
<P>
   The location was easy to find, he recalls, because of the many
off-duty taxis, carrying Haitian drivers and their families in
party clothes, making a beeline there. Ms. Weller, enchanted by the
music, immediately made up her mind to take the band to the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Midsummer Night Swing features more orchestras than
ever, many with well-known guest instrumentalists and vocalists. A
few large ensembles, like the swing band of the tenor saxophonist
Illinois Jacquet, who closes the festival on July 25, are working
dance bands of long standing. Others are made up of veterans from
historic or popular big bands, or, in the case of the American
Theater Orchestra (playing on July 16), from Broadway pit
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   The Chico O'Farrill Afro-Cuban Jazz Big Band is an all-star
band. For the Midsummer festival and a few other appearances, it
will play a special repertory of classic big-band swing, relying on
period dance charts. The band is conducted by its founder, an
arranger for Count Basie and Benny Goodman and one of the
innovators of Latin jazz during the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the band's comparatively recent origins, however,
Angeloro points out that it has ``a lot to say,'' like
Septentrional, which is why each has been given a full evening
alone.
</P>
<P>
   On 10 of the festival's 24 evenings, two (and in one case,
three) bands have been paired. Ms. Weller derives particular
delight from planning the mixed programming, which offers her a
freedom to make connections similar to that enjoyed by disk
jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Among her most imaginative groupings is the one on July 14, when
Tanguardia, an American band well regarded among tango dancers for
its Argentine tangos, milongas and waltzes, will share the bill
with Orquesta la Moderna Tradicion, which specializes in the
lovely, soft, yet structurally intricate Cuban dance form, danzon.
</P>
<P>
   The tango, which emerged on the waterfront of Buenos Aires at
the turn of the last century, and the danzon, which wended its way
during the 1800s from Haiti to Cuba (and, in a varied offshoot, to
Mexico), differ in their challenge to dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The tango is much more complex, but both traditions include a
spectacular weave of influences from Europe and Africa, as well as
from South America. (One section of the danzon, in fact, evolved
into what is commonly known as the cha-cha.) To hear experts in
both influential traditions on the same evening is an opportunity
to sharpen the ear and appreciate the distinctive qualities of
each.
</P>
<P>
   Learning about the traditions of the musical styles presented at
the Midsummer festival _ whether swing, country western or soul
calypso _ is a way to see the dynamics of immigration. Today, these
far-flung influences are called ``multiculturalism.'' They could
also be called, simply, music.
</P>
<P>
   Even a strictly traditional acoustic band that specializes in a
native musical repertory, like Moving Cloud, virtuosos of historic
Irish jigs, reels and hornpipes, range into related music from
other continents; they also acknowledge diverse influences in their
Irish tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Moving Cloud's founder, Paul Brock, is a master of several forms
of the characteristically Irish accordion, which he learned to play
as a child entirely by listening to recordings of older virtuosos.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Irish music since the first wave of emigration
during the great famine of the 1840s, he points out, is the story
of Irish musicians traveling to distant lands, affecting and being
in turn affected by the music they encountered there, then bringing
the new music back to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, when many remarkable Irish instrumentalists
landed in New York City, they sent back recordings. Growing up in
the Irish Midlands during the 1950s, Brock listened intently to
78-rpm records of Irish-American accordionists, brought to his home
by a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center, which has sponsored the Midsummer festival since
its first year in 1989, reports that roughly four-fifths of its
audiences are listeners or dancers outside the bandstand. The
remaining fifth are dancers who each pay $10 to enter the set for
an evening: 850 of them when the ballroom is filled to capacity,
which can happen as early as 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   These dancers are given more than proximity to the often
world-class musicians; they are treated to an excellent
80-foot-by-60-foot dance floor, and are invited to take
preperformance classes in basic elements of the featured dances,
led by some of the finest teachers of social dancing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This year's roster of teachers includes staff or guest faculty
members from several of New York's major dance studios, including
world champions in competition dance like Pierre Dulaine and Yvonne
Marceau, co-founders of American Ballroom Theater (teaching on July
16, before the American Theater Orchestra), Sandra Cameron (July
10, the orchestras of Steve Ross and Bob Hardwick), and Paul
Grecki, who taught Ms. Weller to dance (July 25, Illinois Jacquet).
</P>
<P>
   There will be a class in mambo with the masters Eddie and Maria
Torres (July 18, Azucar Negra) and in the hustle with Maria Torres
(no relation), president of the annual Hustle U.S.A. Dance
Championship, of which she was a co-founder (July 8, Loleatta
Holloway and Rochelle Fleming).
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, the Argentine tango will be taught by the
understated, Russian-born milonguero Tioma Maloratsky and his
virtuosic Argentina-born partner, Viviana Parra; that same night
the danzon will be demonstrated by the bravura percussionist
Roberto Borrell, remarkable co-founder (with the violinist Tregar
Otton) of Orquesta La Moderna Tradicion, who survived the Mariel
boat lift from Cuba to resurrect his musical career in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Every evening, too, Midsummer dancers have a good view of the
demonstrations by dance virtuosos that take place onstage during
the band's break.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday afternoon, a scowling sky notwithstanding, several
hundred children, their parents in tow, presented themselves to
Dulaine, the ballroom dancer and teacher extraordinaire, for an
``Iced Tea Dance'' lesson to recorded music. Dulaine, who has a
thriving program of ballroom dance classes for students in 4th, 6th
and 10th grades in the New York City public schools, expects to see
results in an hour, and he takes a good-humored military approach
to effect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you spell tango?'' he shouted into a microphone wrapped
around his movie-star profile.
</P>
<P>
   A thin voice piped up from the crowd: ``T-A-N-G-O.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right!'' Dulaine said. ``How old are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten,'' said the voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty good,'' Dulaine said. ``Now. You're all going to take
three walks forward on the first three letters: T-A-N. Then step on
one foot and bring the other in to meet it slowly. That's G-O. The
rhythm is slow, slow, uh-quick-quick, slow. Do it for me!''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the crowd its marching orders, he cried at the top of his
lungs: ``T-A-N-G-O. Tango! Next step!''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of an hour, children so small that their partnering
parents had to hunch down to hold them properly in a ballroom
``frame'' had more or less gotten the idea. Then, just as the storm
clouds were breaking, Dulaine gathered the audience before the
bandstand for a demonstration by young ballroom dancers of
eye-popping accomplishment: mamboing teen-agers from the Eddie
Torres Junior Company and a pair of junior amateur world-dance
competitors from the Kaiser Dance Academy in Brooklyn, run by
Victor Kanevsky. The couple _ 10-year-old Victorya Smushkl and
ll-year-old Artem Shukhat _ performed a medley of dances while the
rain fell. The audience, drop-jawed, stayed put to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be choreographers,'' one onlooker wished. ``Bring back the
musicals to make people want to dance like that.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes music danceable? All the Midsummer dance teachers and
musicians asked mentioned a consistent tempo, but perhaps the most
detailed answer was offered by the venerable master of Southwestern
guitar styles, Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown, who appeared during
the festival's first week with his Big Easy band.
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' Brown said, ``you've got to have the beat just right.
Then you've got to stick to a theme. A song or tune should have a
melody. Never play three slow tunes in a row. And don't play a tune
so long that people forget what you're playing. A song with too
many lyrics isn't good; short, sweet and snappy is best. The music
shouldn't be too loud. I like to make every tune sound different,
too. Even if two in a row have to be in the same key every now and
then, you vary the structure of the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   ``The music should say something.''
</P>

JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE REVIEW: CREATIVE ENTERPRISE AMID BERKSHIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Performances by the Paul Taylor Dance Company and Donald
Byrd/The Group are the formal attractions this weekend at the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But informal dance sprouts, it seems, in every lawn, hill and
grove, ranging from spontaneous eruptions like solitary pirouette
practice in a parking lot to free organized events like lectures,
exhibitions, book signings, self-guided walking tours and even a
hands-on interactive computer installation.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the most popular of such events is the ``Inside/Out''
series of staged performances, on Fridays and Saturdays at 7 p.m.,
on a rustic outdoor stage with a lush view of Berkshire greenery.
(Bring the mosquito repellent, though.) The festival closes Aug.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``Inside/Out'' artists are recognized New York
choreographers and dancers. Others are new but promising, and
several are presenting work they have developed during Pillow
residencies. In the first category is Hernando Cortez, whose Cortez
and Company will present dances performed last month in Manhattan
at Dance Theater Workshop. (David Grenke's new Thingsezisee'm
Dance/Theater group performs Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   What can Pillow audiences expect Friday night? Cortez, a former
Paul Taylor dancer who is now with Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak
Dance Project, is a compelling dancer and a choreographer who is
willing to wear his heart unpretentiously on his sleeve. He knows
how to put movement together clearly and fluidly in dance that
makes his performers look good. Several of the dances on this
program suggest, however, that his ideas have not kept pace with
his development as a choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Wood,'' performed to music by David Darling, offers a
chance to savor Cortez's precisely balanced mix of muscularity and
fine-scaled physical articulation, of abandon and inward-focused
containment.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez juxtaposes a quiet, wondering individuality with the
heedless rush of the crowd in ``Bittersweet Symphony,'' set to a
pounding score by the Verve. In a group of robotic aerobic
exercisers, one woman separates to pick up and gently deposit tiny
toy birds with several others following suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Lover'' and ``Whisper at a Thousand,'' quartets danced to
music by Beethoven and Philip Glass respectively, address death in
unusually serene ways, with dancers settling briefly into poses and
groupings suggestive of Victorian tombstone sculptures. ``Shining
Path,'' set to music by John Adams, was an elegiac dance for an
Adam and an Eve dressed in costumes that looked like stylish
swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Blind Love/Cruel Beauty'' and ``She Referred to `The
Evening' as if It Were a Person,'' dances set to music by Handel
and Leslie Stuck respectively, look as if they have been included
only to suggest Cortez's range of choreographic styles.
</P>
<P>
   The program by the Paul Taylor dancers, appearing at the Ted
Shawn Theater on Friday night at 8, Saturday at 2 and 8:30 p.m. and
Sunday at 2 p.m., will include Taylor's juicy new tango piece,
``Piazzolla Caldera.'' Byrd's group, appearing at the Doris Duke
Studio Theater on Friday night at 8:15 and Saturday and Sunday at 5
p.m., will perform his new ``Jazz Train,'' set to scores by Max
Roach, Vernon Reid and Geri Allen.

DANCE REVIEW: DEFEATING OUTDOOR PITFALLS WITH AN AFTERNOON FROLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a risky proposi4ion to present dance outdoors
in an urban setting. The program must be strong enough to survive
the depredations of jets, boomboxes, weather shifts and audience
inattention. As q result, mere accessibility often overrules
artistic taste and quality.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case, however, with ``Dancing With Myself!,''
presented by the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation in a
late-afternoon performance Wednesday on the lawn of Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   The program wAs short, running its course in just under an hour.
The seven choreographers, chosen by Peter Diggins, represented
ballet and modern and Broadway dance. The seven new solos, which
ranged from the mildly entertaining to the intriguing, were strong
and simple enough to capture the attention of passers-by and draw
them in. And the roster of performers offered a chance to catch up
with some new and familiar dancers who are seldom seen these days
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Yeager, a former principal at American Ballet Theater,
opened the program in Peter Pucci's ``Betweef the Voices,'' danced
to a sort of breathy yodeling by Sweet Honey in the Rock. Most of
the solos were preceded by brief comments from their
choreographers. Pucci talked of his intent to create a piece for
Ms. Yeager that bridged her ballet world and his world of modern
dance.
</P>
<P>
   There were no revelations about either form or about his
ballerina in ``Between the Voices.'' But Pucci's intent was clear
in the choreography, a matter of flick and ooze, with promenades in
arabesque balanced by long, easy breathing and slow subsidings into
the ground. And Ms. Yeager delicately embodied Pucci's balance of
dreaminess and joy.
</P>
<P>
   Like a clap of thunder after distant summer music, Mia Michaels'
``I Am'' spilled Jason Parsons onto the stage and let him loose to
revel in continual shifts between satanic energy and exhaustion,
moving to music by Tori Amos. Parsons is a strikingly committed
performer. Tall and sinuous, dressed in black briefs under a
rose-colored sarong with painted, curled-back lips and glittering
eyes, he looked like a refugee from an exceedingly decadent rock
group.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Pucci and Michaels solos, Christopher Wheeldon's
``Agnus Dei'' was most of all a showcase for the soloist, in this
case young Jared Angle of the New York City Ballet. The gentle flow
of the piece gave Angle a chance to display his attenuated ballet
body line and youthful solemnity. But the choreography did not make
it clear why Wheeldon had chosen the very specific score, the Agnus
Dei from Poulenc's Gloria.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Peterson's ``Something Like a Tango,'' performed to music
by Gary Chang, was created for the recent International Ballet
Competition in Jackson, Miss. The jazzy, spiky choreography
doubtless served its purpose of jolting weary competition judges.
</P>
<P>
   But the dance offered a frustratingly narrow glimpse of Melissa
Wishinski, a much-talked-about young dancer who trained under
Peterson at the Hartford Ballet and was making her New York debut
here. A bronze medalist in Jackson, Ms. Wishinski is a confident
performer with a youthful sweetness and glow, and a dancer who
clearly promises much in terms of classical technique.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Shriver, a Broadway choreographer and performer, brought
that larger-than-life perspective to bear on ``The Living Room,''
performed by David Elder to a song by Randy Newman. Ms. Shriver
never moved beyond the obvious in this ``empty chair'' solo about
loss and grieving. Elder, also a Broadway performer, is a
beautifully supple mover, but his repertory of facial expressions
was small and over-used, and he looked as if he might break into
song at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Person, a former member of Dance Theater of Harlem, has
just begun to choreograph, but she already knows the value of
simplicity, usually a hard-won attribute. Ms. Person's ``River
Goddess,'' danced to traditional Afro-Cuban music performed live,
was a loving, knowing valentine to Virginia Johnson, the longtime
ballerina of the Harlem ballet troupe. But Ms. Person also gave Ms.
Johnson substance enough for her to inhabit the dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``River Goddess'' offered a clearsighted exposition of Ms.
Johnson's special blend of fragility and power. Dressed in an
exquisitely exotic costume by Pamela Allen, Ms. Johnson was part
temple dancer, part sensuous temptress of Middle Eastern street
bazaars, suggesting, too, an antic spirit rising from and riding a
timeless river. The musicians were Don Babatunde Eaton, Gwen
Laster, Anna Ofori and Bernard Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Margo Sappington closed the program with a bit of exuberant
trash called ``Valentina . . . Unplugged,'' set to music by
Santana. The pleasure of the solo was to see the way Valentina
Kozlova made the most of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a purple lace body stocking with a purple scarf
accenting her bottom, Ms. Kozlova waved a fan of peacock feathers
and flirted teasingly with the audience in dance that consisted of
ladylike vamping in struts and poses, with fouettes thrown in for
incongruous good measure. Christian Holder designed the costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing With Myself!'' was part of the ``New Work, New York''
series in the summer festival of free music, dance and film in
Bryant Park. The dance programming continues with performances on
July 15 by Neta Pulvermacher and her company, and on Sept. 16 by
Sarah Skaggs, who will teach the audience her dance moves.

BLAIR DENOUNCES ARSONIST ATTACKS ON 10 CATHOLIC CHURCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Arsonists believed to be members of
a dissident Protestant group set fire to 10 Roman Catholic churches
in Northern Ireland late Wednesday and early Thursday, causing
fears that wider sectarian violence could return to the British
province.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the fires were probably the work of the Loyalist
Volunteer Force, a Protestant group opposed to the peace effort,
which has produced cooperation between Protestants and Catholics in
a new provincial assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move for a British prime minister, Tony
Blair flew here Thursday to try to dispel rising tension in the
mostly Protestant province. Prime ministers normally avoid the
province at such times, leaving the problems to government
officials and the 30,000-member security force.
</P>
<P>
   Blaib, standing Thursday in front of a charred and gutted church
north of Belfast, said, ``I think the act of destruction that we
see behind me here _ that is the past of Northern Ireland, and we
are trying to give people a future that leaves acts of barbarism
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   After consoling parishioners of the church, St. James, in the
hamlet of Aldergrove, Blair spent the day with Protestant and
Catholic leaders of the Northern Ireland Assembly to work out a
compromise in a dispute that seemed to provoke the burnings.
</P>
<P>
   The arsonists were apparently retaliating against Catholics for
a British government decision on Monday forbidding Protestant
marchers next Sunday to pass through a Catholic area. The dispute
threatens more violence, possibly retaliation by Catholics against
Protestant churches and against meeting halls of the Orange Order,
which runs some 3,000 parades in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, both Catholic and Protestant, fear that Sunday's
parade in the Drumcree area of Portadown, west of Belfast, could
cause violence across the province, as it has for the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are trying to arrange a compromise that would
provide for a quiet, token march by the Orangemen through the
Catholic enclave, without the traditional martial airs, loud drums,
bugles and fifes. That way, the government ban could be rescinded
and both Orange and Catholic militants could save face.
</P>
<P>
   If the Protestant marchers insist on sticking to their
traditional route, they risk clashes with police and with angry
Catholics. The Protestants say their marches are a matter of
freedom of assembly, a basic democratic right. Many Catholics
resent the marches: they celebrate the decisive victory of William
of Orange over his father-in-law, King James II, in 1690.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
tells people that the Orange marches through Catholic sections are
equivalent to permitting the Ku Klux Klan to march through Harlem.
The leader of the Catholic protest in Portadown, Brendan McKenna,
is a former IRA operative who served time in a British prison for
terrorist offenses involving explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Blair met at Castle Buildings in the Stormont area of Belfast
with David Trimble, the Protestant leader and first minister of the
new assembly, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, a Catholic leader of
the Social Democratic Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Blair congratulated them on the start of the new assembly, which
held its first session on Wednesday. He campaigned for the assembly
in May before the referendum that approved the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The arson was widely and vehemently denounced by political and
church leaders, Catholic and Protestant. The Rev. Ian Paisley, the
hard-line leader known for his open anti-Catholicism, denounced the
attacks. Trimble performed his first official task Thursday
morning, visiting St. James, where he said the arson was ``an
appalling, dastardly attack,'' adding, ``Only a handful of people
can take any pleasure in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Protestant clerics, from the Presbyterian Church and the
Church of Ireland, arrived at the church to offer their
condemnation and condolences to the pastor, the Rev. John
O'Sullivan, a soft-spoken man who said, ``It is hard to understand
how this is serving any useful purpose to God or to politics''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Kelly, who runs a pub across the road from the church,
said of the vandals, ``I think they think if there were no
Catholics, there would be no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A very old, feeble man, perhaps in his 80s, dressed in a black
suit and tie, shuffled into the pub for a cup of tea. He grasped a
visitor's arm and whispered: ``Bad show, bad show. We used to have
respect for each other's place of worship.'' &QL;

POP REVIEW: MICHAEL CRAWFORD BECOMES THE PHANTOM OF RADIO CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many singers have recorded ``The Music of the
Night,'' that big greasy slice of ham and melted Swiss cheese from
``The Phantom of the Opera,'' in which the title character,
sounding like a lascivious hypnotist, feverishly coaxes his
reluctant dream lover to let her ``darker side give in.''
</P>
<P>
   But in imbuing this hunk of seductive bombast with creepy-crawly
melodrama, no one can touch Michael Crawford, who performed it on
Broadway more than 3,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Music of the Night'' is Crawford's million-dollar calling
card, the vehicle through which he made the almost unprecedented
leap from contemporary Broadway leading man to bona fide pop star.
</P>
<P>
   And at Radio City Music Hall, where he appeared with a 40-piece
orchestra and chorus on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, Crawford
milked his signature song for all it was worth, portentously
intoning the opening bars offstage at the beginning of the show,
then performing a complete rendition later on
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's theatrically supercharged approach to ``The Music of
the Night,'' is similar to the way he treats most of his material,
which runs toward large-scale sentimental ballads. Beginning in a
hushed tension-filled whisper that verges on a hiss, he
methodically unfurls his reedy Irish-sounding tenor until it
becomes the braying sob of an overgrown child pleading for another
piece of candy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crawford's voice is too quirky for opera, he flaunts
many operatic mannerisms, from broad gesticulation to enunciation
so exaggeratedly precise it treats lyrics like phonics lessons
inspired by pseudo-sacred texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Music of the Night'' is really more than a song in
Crawford's highly polished show, which is touring 32 cities. It
supplies the running theme in his flowery between-numbers patter,
in which he gasses on effusively about the power of music to unite
people in laughter and in tears, and delivers rose-colored personal
reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   After opening Wednesday's show with a ferociously over-the-top
rendition of ``Gethsemane,'' from ``Jesus Christ Superstar,''
Crawford momentarily quieted down to offer a tear-stained page from
his personal scrapbook, commemorating his beloved Irish nanny who
died at the age of 99 with a sweetly crooned version of ``I'll Take
You Home Again, Kathleen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't quiet for long. ``Before the Parade Passes By,''
``Being Alive'' and two numbers from a recent inspirational album,
``On Eagle's Wings'' (Atlantic) found Crawford back on his pulpit.
``Gethsemane'' was finally surpassed in intensity at the end of the
show with a rendition of ``Papa Can You Hear Me?'' (from the movie
``Yentl''), directed heavenward, that was so fervent that it made
Barbra Streisand's version sound demure.
</P>
<P>
   Was ``An Evening With Michael Crawford In Concert'' as
unabashedly corny as pop concert can get? Yes. But for all the
singer's florid gestures, the show had enough heart to make you end
up liking this former choirboy turned maestro of flamboyant
sentiment.

TREASURIES RALLY AMID SIGNS OF ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices rallied in an abbreviated pre-holiday
session Thursday, as the dollar gathered strength in currency
trading and the government's latest report on employment suggested
the economy was slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32, to 107 19/32. The
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,
fell to 5.60 percent from 5.62 percent Wednesday. Last Friday, the
yield was 5.63 percent. The market closed at 2 p.m. Thursday and
will be closed Friday in observance of Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gains came early as the dollar rallied against the yen on
investors' skepticism over Japan's latest plan to fix its ailing
banks. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like
Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices were also bolstered by the June employment report,
which showed that the pace of job creation slowed in the month.
``This report provided some bullish support for the market because
it revealed significantly lower wage pressures than the market was
expecting,'' said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief
economist for Banc One Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said that if signals of an economic slowdown
continue, the market may even begin to price in the possibility of
a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes of the May 19 meeting of Fed policy-makers, which
were released Thursday, show that the Fed remained concerned about
a flare-up in inflation. The decision to hold rates steady at the
May meeting came over the objections of two Fed policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The May meeting minutes ``tell us that it will take many more
economic reports to convince policy-makers that current economic
growth is no longer a threat to our long-term inflation outlook,''
Chan said. `` Recent trends show this may very well occur in the
near-term future.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week investors have little hard data to scrutinize with the
report on June producer prices on Friday being the most important
report. And although the report does not incorporate the effects of
import prices, say economists, it should still mimic the benign
price environment echoed in much of the data recently released.

CNN RETRACTS NERVE GAS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a month after reporting the dramatic news that the
United States had used deadly sarin nerve gas during a secret 1970
mission in Laos to kill American defectors, CNN Thursday apologized
and retracted the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insufficient evidence that sarin or any other deadly
gas was used,'' said CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson in a
statement that aired at noon. ``Furthermore, CNN cannot confirm
that American defectors were targeted.'' While apologizing to
viewers, Johnson said CNN ``owes a special apology to the personnel
involved in Operation Tailwind.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's retraction was based on the findings of a 54-page report
filed by noted media attorney Floyd Abrams, who was commissioned by
the network to conduct an independent investigation of the nerve
gas allegations.
</P>
<P>
   That June 7 story, which was reported by CNN producer April
Oliver and international correspondent Peter Arnett, marked the
debut of a CNN ``NewsStand'' prime time program that is a joint
collaboration between CNN and corporate partner Time magazine.
Although Time did not use its own reporters, it did publish a
version of the ``NewsStand'' story in its June 15 issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of CNN's admission, a network source said that
``NewsStand'' senior executive producer Pamela Hill has resigned,
Oliver and senior producer Jack Smith will be leaving the network,
and Arnett has been reprimanded. The Associated Press reported that
Oliver said she was fired and was standing by the accuracy of her
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In Thursday's statement, Johnson also apologized to ``our
colleagues at Time'' and asserted that ``CNN alone bears
responsibility for both the television reports and for the printed
article in the June 15 issue of Time.'' Nevertheless, Time managing
editor Walter Isaacson Thursday issued his own apology and
retraction, saying Time's and CNN's investigation ``concluded that
the facts simply do not support the allegations that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources at CNN and Time said plans were afoot to tighten the
reporting procedures on ``NewsStand'' but that there was no thought
of ending the partnership. ``We'll be a lot more careful,'' said
CNN spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that ``a very strong
relationship persists'' between Time and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The ``NewsStand'' program _ cohosted by CNN's Bernard Shaw and
Jeff Greenfield _ is part of new CNN/US president Richard Kaplan's
plan to build ratings for the network's prime time programming. And
the stunning June 7 nerve gas story _ essentially indicting the US
government for war crimes _ made an instant impact.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story, Secretary of Defense William Cohen
responded that the use of nerve gas in 1970 ``would ... have
violated our own policy at the time,'' and announced a Pentagon
investigation into the allegations. (Thursday, a Department of
Defense spokesman said that probe would continue and was expected
to conclude in a few days.)
</P>
<P>
   But nagging questions about the ``NewsStand'' story also began
to surface quickly. Former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and
General William Westmoreland expressed doubts that the United
States would have used chemical weapons in Vietnam. Numerous news
media outlets produced stories questioning CNN's findings. And one
of the cable network's military advisers, retired Air Force Major
General Perry Smith, resigned in disagreement with the story.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, CNN stood by its reporting, running a June 14
``NewsStand'' piece affirming its original story. And in an
interview with The Boston Globe, Greenfield expressed his belief
that the nerve gas piece was ``awfully solidly sourced.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Thursday's retraction, analysts wondered whether a
network with a reputation for solid journalism had done serious
damage to its credibility and overreached in an effort to launch a
flashy prime time news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can make a mistake of this magnitude and not
suffer the consequences,'' said Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman
Foundation at Harvard University. ``At what point is it going to be
possible for journalists to resist the pressure ... to compete for
revenue dollars rather than focus on quality?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Marvin Kalb, director of Harvard's Shorenstein Center on
the Press, Politics, and Public Policy: ``I cannot help but believe
that the marriage (between CNN and Time) is not going to last very
long.''

 &HT;    Proposed vaccine could treat HIV-positive people by tricking
immune system
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneva _ One of the co-discoverers of the AIDS virus, Dr. Robert
Gallo, is preparing to launch a vaccine study that he said could
lead to a new way to treat HIV-positive people by manipulating
their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo won't be using an HIV vaccine, but instead a vaccine that
will suppress substances in the blood that prevent healthy,
uninfected immune system cells from proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the vaccine stems from new knowledge about how the
virus attacks human immune cells and how the body responds _ or
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, who heads the Institute of Human Virology at the
University of Maryland in Baltimore, spoke Thursday at the 12th
World AIDS Conference about new possibilities for preventing HIV
from invading cells and turning them into miniature munitions
factories that churn out more viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of AIDS treatment research focuses on using drugs to stop
the replication of HIV once it has already attacked and entered
cells.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallo said he believes it may be possible to halt the virus
at an earlier stage by blocking it from entering cells in the first
place, or by augmenting the immune system, which the experimental
vaccine is intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to start testing the vaccine this fall in Baltimore. It
has already been tried among 50 adults in Africa, with good
results.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Thompson, lead researcher for the AIDS Research
Consortium of Atlanta, called Gallo's talk encouraging, although
she said it probably will be a few years before widely applicable
therapies can be derived from the concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think one of the hopeful things, although it's not
immediately hopeful, is that there will be new targets for
therapy,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   One approach involves naturally occuring molecules called
beta-chemokines, which are credited with preventing HIV infection
in some hemophiliacs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have learned that HIV enters cells through the same
keyhole that chemokines use, called chemokine receptors. If an
over-abundance of chemokines are present in the blood, they lock
out HIV.
</P>
<P>
   A specific gene mutation may also confer immunity to HIV by
decreasing or eliminating the number of chemokine receptors in host
cells. A fraction of people of Caucasian ancestry possess one or
two copies of this mutant gene. Two copies provide total immunity;
one copy permits infection but slows the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''HIV needs the chemokine receptor to enter the cell,'' Gallo
said. ''If you're born without the receptor, you're uninfectable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible treatment option is based on the gp41 protein
on HIV's outer coat. This protein fuses with human host cells.
</P>
<P>
   The drug manufacturer Roche is testing a substance, T-20, that
stops this fusion. In preliminary studies it has reduced virus
levels in the blood, Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers said Thursday a weakened virus that many
consider the best hope for an AIDS vaccine may actually cause the
disease it was meant to prevent, citing tests on adult monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The approach _ what scientists call a live, attenuated vaccine _
initially protects monkeys from getting infected with the simian
version of HIV. However, the new work shows that over time, the
weakened virus can mutate into a lethal form that causes the
disease it was meant to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers infected nine monkeys with a live attenunated
vaccine. Five years later, six had developed AIDS, five were dead
and none were immunologically normal, s &QC; aid Dr. Ruth Ruprecht of
Harvard University, who called the results ''sobering.''

version of HIV. However, the new work shows that over time, the
weakened virus can mutate into a lethal form that causes the
disease it was meant to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers infected nine monkeys with a live attenunated
vaccine. Five years later, six had developed AIDS, five were dead
and none were immunologically normal, s &QC; aid Dr. Ruth Ruprecht of
Harvard University, who called the results ''sobering.''

 &HT;    National Black Arts Festival: Familiar faces, features make
encore appearances in midst of newcomers
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA--Five days before the start of the National Black Arts
Festival and, one could say, the returns are already in. Legendary
vocalist Abbey Lincoln is returning for the biennial event. Actress
Phyllis Stickney is back. And so is poet-author Sonia Sanchez, the
Big Dance and the Black Rock Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   While two-time Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson's staging of
``Jitney'' and the first American performance of musician-composer
Yusef Lateef's ``African-American Suite'' top the sizable number of
impressive new attractions, much of the programming for the fifth
NBAF is already quite familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there are a number of people at this festival who have
participated in past festivals,'' says NBAF artistic director
Dwight Andrews. ``We've brought back some major artists whom, very
frankly, I wanted to see. I mean, (for instance) Maya Angelou. I
wasn't able to see her the last time because I was curating a
program at the same time of her appearance. There were a number of
major artists that I missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me say this,'' he continues, ``some voices can be
heard more than once. These are not one-hit wonders. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, this familiarity should be qualified. A
performance or program familiar to the NBAF is still hardly a
commonplace experience for your average reader, moviegoer or
theater patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Sonia Sanchez is back and Maya Angelou will be there,
and so on,'' remarks New York author and cultural critic Nelson
George, a featured guest at past festivals. ``But where else can
anyone who pays the ticket price go see a Maya Angelou or Sonia
Sanchez and possibly run into August Wilson on the way to their
show? And talk to him? That's still an experience unlike any that
immediately comes to my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in empty birthday parties,'' continues
Andrews, making reference to the festival's 10-year anniversary.
``I think this is very representative of where we are, and the
culture is in 1998. We could have done some 10-year retrospective,
but the culture is at too critical a juncture to start looking
back. We need to start thinking and responding to our art in new
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The local arts community seems to agree. Here's what some had to
say about the NBAF offerings as a whole, and what they don't want
to miss. Use it as your guide:
</P>
<P>
   -- Must see in performance/theatre: Alliance Theatre artistic
director Kenny Leon recommends ``Jitney'' on July 12, 14-19 at the
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   -- Must see in film/visual arts: Anne Hubbell, executive
director of Atlanta's Image Film &AMP; Video Center, recommends ``Night
of the Black Independents'' on Friday-Saturday at the Goethe
Institut Atlanta and ``Homage'' on July 13-17 at the High Museum of
Art's Walter Hill Auditorium. ``And the Paul Robeson tribute (July
17 at the Renaissance Atlanta Hotel ballroom and July 17-18 at the
High's Rich Auditorium) is important in the film community and
culturally because a lot of people don't quite understand the wide
influence he had.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Must see music: Mark Shimmel, chief operating officer of
LaFace Records, recommends ``World Drums for Peace'' on July 14 at
Variety Playhouse and the Black Rock Coalition's ``A Max &AMP; Abbey
Conversion in a Jungle Style'' on July 17 at Variety Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   -- Must see literature: G. Ewa Ealy, assistant manager of the
Shrine of the Black Madonna Bookstore, recommends ``An Evening With
Maya Angelou'' on July 16 at Symphony Hall and fiction readings
with John Edgar Wideman and Marita Golden on July 15 at Georgia
Tech's Ferst Center for the Arts. She also suggests creative
nonfiction readings with bell hooks and Nathan McCall on July 16 at
the Ferst Center.
</P>
<P>
   -- Must see dance: Ken Bartlett, executive director of Dancers
Collective, recommends
</P>
<P>
   ``Diverse Duets'' on July 13 at the Rialto Center for the
Performing Arts and Urban Bush Women on July 15 at the Rialto.

 &HT;    Wilson brings issues center stage: Playwright to continue summit
on black theater
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--August Wilson, who is coming to the National Black Arts
Festival here both as a distinguished playwright (``Jitney'') and
the fiery, controversial organizer of a black theater summit, is
not above taking advice on how to improve his plays.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the pointers come from a character in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``One character comes to me and says, `Hey man, nobody gonna
know this is your play!''' says Wilson by phone from his Seattle
office, describing how he recently revised ``Jitney,'' a 1979 tale
about the first taxi cab company to serve his black community of
Pittsburgh. ``I say, `Why is that?' He says, `There ain't no
monologues in this play.' And I looked and saw he was right, so I
went back and put some in.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of two Pulitzer Prizes (``Fences,'' ``The Piano
Lesson'') is inviting a few laughs at his own expense. Yes, his
characters can indeed wax loquacious, to say the least, with
monologues that cover multiple pages. And powerful soliloquies they
are: plain-spoken but poetic testimonies of love, yearning, terror,
suffering, hilarious mischief and mysterious dream visions. They're
delivered by an expanding gallery of African-American characters in
Wilson's projected cycle of 10 dramas, one for each decade of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The revised ``Jitney,'' opening July 12 at the Rialto Center for
the Performing Arts, is the seventh of those plays, representing
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   From writer to public firebrand
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most explosive of all of Wilson's speeches was one
that he delivered himself, not in a play but on the public stage of
racial and cultural politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote manifesto before the Theatre Communications Group
two summers ago, Wilson accused Rrous standard of quality, even if
the grants usually go through white-run theaters. At one point last
year the two theater men actually took their heated argument to a
live debate on a New York stage.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's next move was to call a National Black Theatre Summit
in March at Dartmouth College, to discuss with other major theater
figures practical strategies for bolstering black-run theaters. The
playwright's fire-in-the-gut had not cooled. Among his statements
was a denunciation of a ``Saturday Night Live'' sketch, with guest
star Samuel L. Jackson, that he called ``mean and slanderous to
black Americans. There should have been 100,000 ... black people
surrounding NBC headquarters the next morning.''
</P>
<P>
   National Black Theatre Summit II, the follow-up event at the
NBAF this year, will consist of closed-door meetings and symposia
at the Renaissance Hotel in Atlanta. It will culminate July 15 in a
public forum at the Alliance Theatre, scene of so many outstanding
productions of Wilson's plays (``Joe Turner's Come and Gone.'')
</P>
<P>
   One of the visiting dignitaries will be director Douglas Turner
Ward (``A Soldier's Play''). The fact that the Negro Ensemble
Company, which he founded over 30 years ago, had to suspend
operations a few years ago because of $750,000 in debts dramatizes
the intense plight of many black theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving past the talking phase; we're going to solicit
ideas on what to do and devise a plan,'' says Wilson, a compelling
speaker whose appearance is a must even for those who aren't
galvanized by the summit issues. ``We're looking at how to set up
an organization with memberships for the 50,000 black performing
artists in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Play complements his public agenda
</P>
<P>
   Wilson concluded his Dartmouth summit saying, ``If the condition
of black theater art is dependent on the benevolence of white
America, it has lost its self-determination.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of empowerment will be on display in ``Jitney.''
Growing up on The Hill, the oldest black community of Pittsburgh,
Wilson was struck by the exploits of some unlicensed cabbies or
jitney drivers, who started with a vacant storefront and a pay
phone and built a thriving, colorful business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white cabs wouldn't pick up blacks in those days, so this
was a service that was created from scratch and changed peoples'
lives,'' Wilson says. A key relationship in the play is between a
driver and a son who has just been released from prison after
serving a murder sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jitney'' was the first of Wilson's plays, produced in
Pittsburgh and St. Paul, Minn., but is still the least-known, his
only work not to play New York. The playwright hopes that his
recent revisions will lead to a second life for the 19-year-old
play, which is scheduled for a fall production in Boston that will
help determine its Broadway prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't always value the way black people really talk, the
way I do now,'' Wilson says, by way of explaining why he thinks the
new script is stronger and more t

   FLAT ROCK, NC--
</P>
<P>
   We asked Atlanta actress Suzi Bass, who recently wrapped a
performance in ``The Sound of Music'' at the Flat Rock Playhouse,
to share a few of her favorite things about the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a wonderful place to be, a beautiful place,'' says
Bass, who has been with the Flat Rock company for four years, and
who has worked in Atlanta at the Alliance Theatre and Theatre in
the Square. ``These are five of my 100 favorite things. I could
come up with a bunch more.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Walks around the lake at the Carl Sandburg Home.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sunday brunch at the Highland Lake Inn.
</P>
<P>
   -- Window-shopping in downtown Hendersonville.
</P>
<P>
   -- Browsing at the Wrinkled Egg (gift shop) and the Secret
Garden (gardening shop).
</P>
<P>
   -- A short trip to Saluda to the Spinning Wheel Rug Outlet,
going to Pearson's Falls and then enjoying a cinnamon bun at the
Wildflower Bakery. Yum, yum.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Almost Heroes PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A comic version of Lewis and Clark, with Matthew Perry and the
late Chris Farley as mismatched 19th-century explorers. Novel and
giddily silly at first, but simply dopey by the end. Rated PG-13
for brief nudity, strong language and comic violence. 1 hour, 29
minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world interpreted as a game. While ``Deep Impact'' treated a
similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety, ``Armageddon'' never
lets the threat of global annihilation get in the way of fun. It's
a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the
world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn movie, it's more enjoyable
than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.'' And you'll see the
reported $165 million budget on the screen in the impressive
effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you? Probably
not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex and
profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Silence PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A film worth listening to. Germany's Oscar nominee for best
foreign-language film concerns a musical prodigy who is also her
hearing-impaired parents' crucial link to the rest of the world.
Sensitive and well-acted, the film uses a specific situation to
explore a universal one: how children must learn to separate from
their parents without cutting them off. In German with subtitles.
Rated PG-13 for brief nudity. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Big Hit R
</P>
<P>
   The big ho-hum. Treading territory that ``Grosse Pointe Blank''
covered better last year, ``Hit'' ponders the problems of a
professional killer trying to maintain a domestic life. Mark
Wahlberg plays Mel, a hit man torn between mowing down mobsters and
romancing a girlfriend (Lela Rochon) and a fiancee (Christina
Applegate). Rated R for violence, language, and some sexuality. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Damage NR
</P>
<P>
   Damaged goods. Think of it as a sort of ``That Girl'' for the
'90s. Translation: Two gay guys share the Marlo Thomas part. Hunky
Marc (Michael Shawn Lucas) and cute Robert (Aaron Wlliams) are
struggling actors looking for love and Equity cards in the Big
Apple. The longer the movie lurches along in its blandly
predictable manner, the less likable the paper-thin characters are.
Not rated but contains strong language and gay and straight sexual
situations. 1 hour, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Character NR
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Oscar winner for best foreign language film, this dour
but compelling Dutch import is laden with Dickensian incident and a
Kafka-esque sense of fate. Set in 1920s Rotterdam, it's the tale of
a relentless war waged between a formidable father (Jan Decleir)
and his illegitimate son (Fedja van Huet). Not exactly a
light-hearted romp, but so much happens you barely notice. Not
rated but there is brief sex, nudity and violence. Subtitles. 1
hour, 57 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bette R
</P>
<P>
   Balzac's 1846 novel may have been whittled down, but there's
still much to like about this deliciously tart comedy of
ill-manners and worse morals that slowly ripens into a revenger's
tragicomedy. Jessica Lange stars as the overlooked and
underestimated spinster who devises some elaborate revenge
scenarios for her shallow, wealthy relatives. The artful supporting
cast includes Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins. Rated R for sex and
nudity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Work PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Laughless comedy starring an insufferably smug Norm Macdonald,
the comic who was booted from his slot as ``Weekend Update'' anchor
on ``Saturday Night Live.'' MacDonald plays an allegedly charming
prankster who launches a revenge-for-hire business. Rated PG-13 for
language and comic nudity. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (Newhouse News
Service) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   I Went Down R
</P>
<P>
   In this blithely shapeless bit of blarney, two mismatched Irish
hoodlums _ one a mere amateur (Peter McDonald), the other more
hard-core (Brendan Gleeson) _ embark on a mission for their boss
that's more road-buddy movie than caper. Director Paddy Breathnach
seems perfectly comfortable with the movie's many detours, as do
his delightful actors, both of whom do a lot to help sustain the
film's laid-back, shaggy-dog style. But a little clipping around
the middle might have helped. Rated R for profanity, brief violence
and a brief sex scene. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Land Girls R
</P>
<P>
   More outlandishly soap-opera-ish than genuinely affecting, this
movie about the young women who volunteered to work British farms
during World War II isn't anyone's finest hour. The Dorset
countryside is lushly beautiful, the historical situation
fascinating and the actors (Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna
Friel) good. But it comes off a missed opportunity more than
anything else. Rated R for sex. 1 hour, 55 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Les Miserables PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, well-acted version of the Victor Hugo epic ...
though you may miss the songs. Police inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) once again tracks former convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
through the countryside and alleyways of 19th-century France.
Directed by Bille August (``Pelle the Conqueror''), the movie's
worth a look even if it lacks the novel's breadth and vision. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist. Rated PG for brief mild
language. 1 hour, 27 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed. Rated PG-13 for violence and
language. 2 hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Wedding Singer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A sweet 'n' silly love song of a movie. It's 1985. Adam Sandler
is the titular matrimonial entertainer. Drew Barrymore is a
sweetheart of a waitress. They're clearly Meant For Each Other, but
otherwise engaged. The pre-teen boys who rented ``Happy Gilmore''
by the billions may not be entranced, but the date crowd will
appreciate the shrewd blend of '80s jokes (Deloreans? Billy Idol?)
and romance lite. Rated PG-13 for mild sexual situations and vulgar
language. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Woo R
</P>
<P>
   An uneven but spirited comedy about trying to find true love
amid a meat-market mentality. Jada Pinkett Smith is the title
character, a woman who's been so burned by the doggy behavior of
guys, she approaches her latest blind date (Tommy Davidson) with
the determination to prove his innate canine drive. Rated R for
language, sex and marijuana smoking. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade:
B-
</P>

 &HT;    Teens from a rainbow of backgrounds learn to share pride and
pain while gaining a world of insight
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Banner Elk, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   What are some stereotypes?'' the Rev. Jimmy Harper asks 42
teenagers sitting around his feet in the dining hall of Hoston
Presbyterian Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to think all Mexicans ride around in the backs of
trucks,'' a Hispanic boy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without knowing about your religion, people assume you worship
the devil or are in a cult or something,'' said a Baha'i boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend who has really short hair. A lot of people
think she's a lesbian,'' said a white girl.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion winds its way through hatred and prejudice,
personal and communal hurt and anger, and ends with talk about
spiritual values, love, tolerance and respect for other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's those things that make us good, decent human beings,''
Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   The teens applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Anytown, a weeklong camp run each year by the Atlanta
office of the National Conference for Community and Justice,
formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Its purpose is to bring together high school students of various
religions, races and cultures to get to know one another as
friends.
</P>
<P>
   This mountain setting near North Carolina's ski slopes is one of
about 40 locations across the country where Anytowns are held each
summer. Harper, 57, an ordained Southern Baptist minister married
to a Jewish woman, is the conference's regional director.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 session is the 10th sponsored by the Atlanta office.
Students who came as ``delegates,'' or campers, are back as
counselors and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   James Mills, 25, the camp's co-director, was there in 1989. ``It
rained every single day. It was a good three-quarters of a mile
from the cabins to the meeting area,'' he said. ``And we had a
great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills has missed only one session of the camp, which has rented
space at various locations over the years.
</P>
<P>
   A math teacher at DeKalb County(Ga.)'s Indian Creek Elementary
School, where more than half the student body is international,
Mills said he uses his Anytown experience ``every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Counselor Genevieve Colquitt, 18, was a delegate in 1996, when
she was a student at Pebblebrook High School in Mableton, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I realized about other people is that although we are
different and go through different experiences and have different
backgrounds, basically we are the same. We have the same pain, no
matter where we're from,'' she said. ``I got a lot of skeletons out
of my closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Adviser Amy Ward, 22, a student at the University of Tennessee
in Knoxville, attended an Anytown in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I was mostly surrounded by white
people,'' said Ward, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think of myself as prejudiced, but when I got into
that group, I noticed stereotypes I had, whether they affected my
direct actions or not,'' she said. ``The opportunity to spend time
with people of different backgrounds was so incredible to me. I
learned so much.''
</P>
<P>
   At the university, she has gotten involved in political
movements to promote civil rights and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Through Anytown, she said, she realized ``just how few people of
color and women are in positions of power. I'm working to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Barin Sultani, 15, came to Anytown as a camper. This
year, she is Anytown's first counselor intern. Born in Afghanistan,
she is a student at DeKalb County's Druid Hills High School.
</P>
<P>
   As a Muslim, she said, she has had to clear up misconceptions
about Muslim women. Meanwhile, she has learned about other
religions and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Anytown is all about,'' she said. ``Correcting
wrongs.''

 &HT;    Connemara recalls Sandburg, the goats
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flat Rock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Tapestry the goat is not a kid anymore. The flop-eared Nubian
whose mottled coat inspired her name is a yearling now _ much to
the delight of the youngsters who remember her from their last
visit to the goat farm at Connemara, the Carl Sandburg Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't wait to see if any of the babies they saw last
summer would still be here,'' says their dad, Don Buckley of
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   The goats have always been a big attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Sandburg's wife, Lilian Steichen Sandburg (called Paula), found
the white-columned home built in 1838 by former Secretary of the
Confederate Treasury Christopher Memminger. Pleased with the gentle
climate and ample pasture, she declared Connemara (named by second
owner Ellison Smyth to honor his Irish ancestry) just right for a
family of seven _ and a growing herd of goats.
</P>
<P>
   So the Sandburg clan _ including three grown daughters, two
grandchildren and the goats _ moved from Michigan in 1945 and
settled quietly into the 240-acre mountainside farm with little
fuss from townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   Today, folks from far and wide take notice. Connemara, a
National Historic Site, is by far Flat Rock's most-visited
attraction, welcoming more than 100,000 visitors a year. About half
that number tour the house, while others simply enjoy the grounds,
including the goat barns, and walk along the five miles of trails
on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Home to the people's poet until his death in 1967, Connemara was
a haven where the author could compose without worldly
distractions. He drew inspiration from the pastoral surroundings
and strength from the mountains, and was able to rejuvenate after
his frequent lecture tours.
</P>
<P>
   But at least in agricultural circles, Connemara was best-known
for Paula's prize-winning goats. In fact, many who bought the
farm's highly regarded goat milk and cheese were surprised to learn
that the woman who bred champion goats was married to one of
America's most beloved poets.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, visitors of all ages are as captivated by the resident
goats as they are by the big white house with Sandburg's library of
more than 10,000 books, stacks of yellowed newspapers and
correspondence lying where he left it.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the estate, it's easy to imagine the place described by
Sandburg's granddaughter, Paula Steichen, who lived at the farm
with her mother, Helga, the youngest Sandburg daughter, and brother
John Carl until she was 10, in her 1969 book ``My Connemara''
(Eastern Acorn Press, $3.95):
</P>
<P>
   ``This wilderness of Connemara, this wild, sweet way of
Connemara, would come back to me always after leaving _ in the
scent of wild blackberries, the nickering of a colt watching its
mother being led away to plow, the feel of wet morning grass on
bare feet, and the moving of a herd at milking time up the pasture
lane. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Connemara has been a National Historic Site since 1968, when the
family sold the property and donated the house's contents to the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the home with a park ranger guide 30 years later, one
gets the feeling that the family is simply away for the day and
will return as soon as we intruders leave. Beds are neatly made,
dishes washed and the dining table set. Rolled-up copies of the
Sunday New York Times lie next to Sandburg's place at the table.
Scraps of paper mark favorite passages in Sandburg's books. Life
magazines are strewn about, waiting to be read, then stacked with
others in orange crates. Sandburg's guitar lies ready for the
troubadour to pluck its strings and warble some traditional ditty
like ``Eating Goober Peas'' in his gravely voice.
</P>
<P>
   Sandburg's cluttered workroom on the third floor, which he
called ``the dizzy corner,'' is in the sort of disarray that only
the person who rendered it that way could sift through.
</P>
<P>
   While the clapboard house is large and comfortable, it is rather
plainly outfitted with solid, reliable furnishings. Black and white
photographs _ notably one of Carl and Lilian in 1923 _ taken by her
brother Edward Steichen grace the walls. Sandburg's collection of
carved walking sticks is amassed in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   After parking in the lot off Little River Road, visitors to the
historic site first see the house in the distance on the side of
Little Glassy Mountain, a lake in the foreground and grassy fields
in between. It's a .3 mile walk via a footbridge over the lake and
up a steep grade to reach the house, but once glimpsed, the
gleaming white structure lures you to its doors. (Strategically
placed benches along the trail provide welcome stopping places as
you ascend 100 feet _ the equivalent of a 10-story building. A
shuttle van is available for guests with disabilities or those not
fit enough to make the trek.)
</P>
<P>
   Plan to spend at least half a day at Connemara. Very little of
the estate is off-limits, although no swimming or fishing in the
lakes is allowed. If you still have the energy after the hike to
the house, take the .8 mile trail around Little Glassy Mountain _
or the .4 mile trail over Little Glassy. It's 1.2 miles along the
Memminger Path to Big Glassy Mountain, from which gorgeous vistas
unfold: lakes and ponds, rolling pastures, dense forests and the
Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays during the summer, the Vagabond Players from Flat
Rock Playhouse present performances such as dramatic adaptations of
``Rootabaga Stories'' at the amphitheater in the meadow in front of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   At the barn complex, rangers give programs about the goats and
offer goat cheese-making demonstrations. Although feeding the goats
is verboten and parents are warned to keep an eye on small
children, gentle petting is fine _ the goats seem to enjoy and
expect it.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 goats are descendents of the original herd of
white-on-brown Toggenburgs, white Saanans and multicolored Nubians.
The herd numbered more than 200 head in 1952, when 50 to 80 does
were milked twice a day. The top doe of all time was Jennifer II,
who produced 5,750 pounds of milk in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   House tours begin every 30 minutes in the visitor center on the
main floor, where tickets are sold. While you wait, you can watch
films about Sandburg and the home. Especially worthwhile is the
10-minute video of excerpts from an Edward R. Murrow documentary,
which features Sandburg reading from ``The People, Yes'' and
crooning the moody ``September Song.''
</P>
<P>
   Browsing the bookstore shelves, I was amused to find several
books about goats alongside volumes of Sandburg's poetry and his
acclaimed Lincoln biography. Carl and Paula Sandburg probably
would've liked that.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information: Open daily except Christmas. No admission
charged, but house tours are $3 for adults (free for children under
12). Take I-85 north to U.S. 25 in Greenville, S.C., then north on
U.S. 25 to Flat Rock and turn left on Little River Road between the
Flat Rock Playhouse and the post office. The parking lot is .10
mile on the left. 828-693-4178.

 &HT;    Escape summer in the city at Flat Rock
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flat Rock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   It's 8 o'clock on a Friday night and it seems that every car on
U.S. 25 is heading for the Flat Rock Playhouse _ a red barn of a
building that sits on the same granite outcropping where the
Cherokees held tribal gatherings centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the thousands of cars that descend on the ``flat rock''
that gave the town its name depart two or three hours later, they
leave the town as whisper-quiet as it was before they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Designated the State Theatre of North Carolina, the summer
theater draws 50,000 visitors annually to Flat Rock (population
2,000) between May and October for a nine-play mix of
Broadway-style comedies, classics and musicals. ``The Affections of
May'' is on the boards now, with the musical ``The Will Rogers
Follies'' coming up July 15-Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Big-city production values and a professional acting company
belie the rustic setting and the shorts-and-sandals ambience. Which
is exactly what makes the playhouse so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   But the theater and nearby Carl Sandburg Home aren't the only
reasons to visit the area called ``the Little Charleston of the
Mountains'' since the mid-1800s when wealthy plantation owners,
seeking a respite from the oppressive, coastal heat built large
summer estates where they could relax and unwind.
</P>
<P>
   Flatlanders return to this day for the same reasons, finding
low-key lakeside resorts and cozy old inns to loll for at least a
night or two in the cool, green mountain calm.
</P>
<P>
   For all its charms, Flat Rock is not a typical mountain resort
village. A small sign on the outskirts of town heralds your arrival
in Historic Flat Rock, but you could drive right through and be
halfway to Hendersonville four miles north before you realize
you've passed it by.
</P>
<P>
   Although the entire district is included in the National
Register of Historic Places, there is no quaint main street with
shops, antiques emporiums and restaurants like you'll find in
Hendersonville.
</P>
<P>
   Heading north into Flat Rock along U.S. 25, past green,
undulating mountain ridges and spry orange day lilies waving from
the roadside, the private Kenmure Golf Course and its gated
community of upscale homes hint of the posh life of year-round
residents. There are summer homes tucked all over these hills, but
you don't see many along the main drag.
</P>
<P>
   Near the intersection of Blue Ridge Road (site of the only
traffic light) are a handful of businesses. Dean's Deli and Market
(look for the Exxon sign and boxes of red geraniums along the
porch) is a good spot for a quick breakfast, lunch or snack
(homemade biscuits, pastries, cakes, pies, soups, salads and such).
</P>
<P>
   The Wrinkled Egg is a former general store that sells gifts and
homemade breads baked in a wood-fired oven and assembles ``care
packages'' for parents to send to their kids at area camps. Next
door is the Secret Garden, filled with (and surrounded by) plants
and everything to delight the green thumb. The redbrick Singleton
Center houses a collection of artist studios and galleries. Up the
road is the Book Exchange and the Hand in Hand Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north is the turnoff for the Carl Sandburg Home and the
St. John in the Wilderness Episcopal Church. The latter was built
in 1833 as a chapel on the grounds of Mountain Lodge, the home of
the Charles Barings, the first of many Lowcountry families to
settle in Flat Rock. In 1836, the Barings deeded the yellow brick
church to the Episcopal Diocese of Western North Carolina, and
services have been held here ever since. The church and graveyard
are open 9 a.m.-4 p.m. daily for self-guided tours (828-693-9783).
</P>
<P>
   There are no restaurants in Flat Rock, but the Highland Lake Inn
and the 1852 Woodfield Inn dining rooms are open to nonguests _ and
both worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Pecan-encrusted trout and batter-fried lobster tails and an
outstanding dessert of lemon sorbet and fresh fruit in a praline
basket hit the spot at Woodfield. The next night at Highland Lake's
Old Dining Room, the trout lover among us again ordered the fish,
this time stuffed with crab meat and goat cheese, and proclaimed it
another winner. The marinated and grilled shrimp and scallops
accompanied by garden-fresh vegetables grown on site were also
tasty _ as were desserts of bourbon pecan pie and creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   Both the recently renovated Woodfield (with panoramic views from
its sweeping verandas) and Highland Lake (with tennis, swimming
pool, stocked fishing lake, mountain bikes, organic gardens and a
small working farm) would have been fine places to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   But we were quite content at the Mill House Lodge, where dozens
of indolent Canada geese paddle alongside canoers in the lake and
waddle about on the shore as anglers while away the afternoon. The
Mill House is not fancy but clean, comfortable and homey with a
variety of accommodations including rooms in the 1830 gristmill and
the one-bedroom suite we booked in the Jordan Lodge next to the
swimming pool stocked with fun inflatables. There is no restaurant
on site, but kitchenettes are available and the outdoor grills are
much-used _ as are the porch chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've caught a play and checked out local sights, there's
not much left to do but take it easy. Works for the geese.

 &HT;    Colorful crowd convenes in `Last Resort'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a decade since Alison Lurie's last novel, ``The Truth
About Lorin Jones,'' and 14 years since her delightful ``Foreign
Affairs,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize. Her 1994 short stories in
``Women and Ghosts'' were mere appetizers for readers who hungered
for another novel.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie has cooked up an entree worth the wait. ``The Last
Resort'' is a comic novel of manners that, although lacking the
bite of ``Foreign Affairs,'' is a gourmet summer read.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Walker, 46, has been wife, secretary and research
assistant to naturalist author Wilkie Walker, 25 years her elder.
Their two grown children are horrified by her Victorian attitude,
but Jenny revels in her auxiliary position, at least until Wilkie
inexplicably freezes her out. Hoping to rejuvenate his interest in
life, she suggests they spend the winter in Key West, Fla., the
Last Resort.
</P>
<P>
   The lush locale holds irony for Wilkie, who is secretly
convinced he is dying of cancer. He plans his suicide to look like
an accident, but it does not turn out to be easy to drown oneself,
particularly in a novel peopled by characters who are as colorful
as bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   There are the locals: Lee Weiss, a lesbian who gave up a
counseling career to run a lodge for women; Molly, an
unpretentious, arthritic widow who once drew covers for The New
Yorker; and Jocko, an HIV-infected landscaper. And there are the
visitors: Poet Gerald Grass, who, having discarded a wife and
yuppie girlfriends, hopes to seduce Jenny; Jocko's plant-loving
Mumsie; and his airhead cousin, Barbie Mumpson of Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Readers may remember Barbie from the end of ``Foreign Affairs,''
when she visits Virginia ``Vinnie'' Miner in London. Barbie is the
daughter of Chuck Mumpson, Vinnie's unlikely, loudmouthed lover
from Oklahoma who died of a heart attack. In the interim, Barbie
has maintained her love for animals, her accent and a penchant for
apologizing for her stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   But she has lost a touch of her joie de vivre. Dominating mother
Myra has pushed Barbie into marrying freshman congressman Wild Bob
Hickock. He has been sowing his wild oats with a showgirl, despite
Barbie's attempts to reignite his libido with silver lace camisoles
from Neiman Marcus. Myra, with a Victorianism more ironic than
Jenny's, suggests that Barbie stay married and tell herself she
``was doing it for Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been little that's novel in the
American novel, but this book strolls seldom-trod literary ground
when Jenny is attracted to Lee, and their love flourishes among the
flowers. Think about it: How often do contemporary mainstream
novels have lesbian protagonists? Gay women, when they appear at
all, are most often secondary characters (Patricia Cornwell's Lucy)
or peripheral (Anne Rivers Siddons' couple in ``Up Island''). Lurie
places Jenny and Lee's love front and center, in counterpoint to
Wilkie's rabid homophobia and moves Barbie's heterosexual dilemma
to the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie, aptly compared to Jane Austen by Joyce Carol Oates,
craftily steers the plot away from soap opera or farce down lush
paths of irony. Key West might be a 20th-century version of Bath,
offering the same rejuvenation and discovery of self. But in our
time, Anne Elliott is swept away not by Captain Wentworth, but by
another woman. Austen, were she writing today, would find it droll
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Resort. By Alison Lurie. Henry Holt. $22. 321 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   Another ironic novel of manners from a contemporary Jane Austen.

 &HT;    COLUMN:Graceful grasses perfect ornament for summer lawn
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the air feels like camel's breath and ozone alerts alert
everyone but politicians and policy-makers, when it's hotter than
fire on the Fourth of July and hydrangeas keel over in a heated
faint while roses refuse to bud, the grasses keep on keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   Burn them, dry them, fry them, and still they're as lush as they
want to be.
</P>
<P>
   If I were building a climatically smart garden, ornamental
grasses would be all over it. As it is, my nod to xeriscaping
amounts to less and less watering in an effort to train my plants
to tolerate drought _ and a few patches of perennial grasses here
and there. Most grow in full sunlight, but some do just fine in
light shade.
</P>
<P>
   Flowering time usually starts in late summer and goes into fall,
but this year I've already noticed blooms on one clump of Japanese
silver grass. Must be El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest patch _ maiden grass _ was started in a pot and moved
from Washington to Atlanta in 1989. I put it in the ground that
year and have divided it several times. Nevertheless, it is a hefty
4 feet high and wide. During hot, dry spells, I water it about once
every couple of weeks, and it never falters.
</P>
<P>
   Graceful (sometimes called the queen of ornamental grasses),
this clump with long green leaves, a narrow white stripe down the
center, waves in the slightest breeze, cheerfully, majestically. In
winter, after its blooms have turned fluffy and its leaves have
gone beige, it is still beautiful, elegant with age.
</P>
<P>
   Far less elegant, but chipper, is the festuca, less than a foot
tall with silver-blue leaves and little flower spikes growing well
above the clump. While the festuca does not wave, it speaks
eloquently through its contrast with the nearby brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the aptly named Japanese blood grass, whose leaves
bleed red into green, giving life to space around a granite stone
and evoking vistas of marsh grasses as it ripples in window boxes.
</P>
<P>
   One, whose name I don't know, grows like wild and crazy hair
matted and flying helter-skelter. Call it Cousin It. For more than
a year I haven't known whether this grass is dead or alive. But
even if it has gone on, it is too charming to let go.
</P>
<P>
   Not much to look at, not much to feel, the sweet grass is a
fragrant delight, recalling so many baskets I've known, works of
art and craft, created by artisans around the Southeast. I've
bought them on the streets of Charleston, at mountain fairs,
sniffed them so much I feared I'd suck the smell right out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, sweet sweet grass. Crush it and it's like vanilla mixed with
almond and freshly cut lawn.
</P>
<P>
   My clump came from the U.S. Botanic Garden several years ago. I
put it in a pot, and it comes back each year (defying the rules,
supposedly. Annual lemon grass returns, too).
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the sweet grass has filled its 12-inch pot, and soon,
maybe this fall, I will take it from the container and put it in
the ground, despite warnings that it is invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Invasive. There's the rub many cite when talking about growing
any ornamental grass. True, some are serious spreaders. But, if I'm
choosing among invasive plants, grasses would be one I'd keep.
</P>
<P>
   And sweet grass? Invade me. Take over my garden. Grow like
kudzu. Grow like dwarf bamboo. Like English ivy. What a lovely
invasion this could be.

 &HT;    Legislators, courts refine definition of freedom of worship
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, the Million Man March organized by the Nation
of Islam's Minister Louis Farrakhan and the Promise Keepers' Stand
in the Gap rally of Christian men put religion symbolically in the
center of the nation's capital. But while massive rallies have
drawn public attention, actions in the legislative halls and
courtrooms have been changing and refining the definition of what
freedom of religion, as expressed in the First Amendment to the
Constitution, really means. Here's a snapshot of recent and pending
legislation and court cases affecting religious liberty:
</P>
<P>
   Religious Freedom Amendment
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, a majority of the U.S. House of Representatives voted
in favor of a constitutional amendment introduced by Rep. Ernest
Istook (R-Okla.) to permit school prayer _ but the tally fell short
of the two-thirds majority required. As the legislation went down
in the House, Istook's fellow Oklahoma Republican, Sen. James M.
Inhofe, introduced the same amendment in the Senate. It says in
part, ``The people's right to pray and to recognize their religious
beliefs, heritage or traditions on public property, including
schools, shall not be infringed.'' It specified that no one could
be compelled to join in prayer or other religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   Many mainline groups oppose the legislation. Southern Baptists
supported the Istook amendment after persuading the sponsor to
amend it until they were satisfied it ensured equal access to all
religions.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, says Stephen Kao of the conservative Rutherford
Institute, is ``a laudable attempt to remedy some problems. We did
feel, however, that it was not the best language that could have
been offered.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious Liberty Protection Act
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely sponsoring team of Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah) in the Senate and Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.) and
Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) in the House of Representatives hopes this
legislation will make it more difficult for governments to
interfere with religion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, introduced in June, requires the government to
accommodate religious practices unless they conflict with a
``compelling interest'' of the public, such as health or safety.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most recent link in a chain of legislation and Supreme
Court decisions going back to 1990:
</P>
<P>
   -- Deciding 6-3 in a case known as the Employment Division vs.
Smith, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state of Oregon could
deny unemployment benefits to American Indian men, including Albert
L. Smith, fired from their jobs for the sacramental use of the drug
peyote. The decision came despite briefs on Smith's behalf from an
incredible range of religious organizations. The majority opinion
said no special consideration must be given to religion as long as
a law is generally applicable.
</P>
<P>
   -- In an attempt to gain back ground lost in the Smith decision,
a broad coalition of religious groups and an overwhelming
bipartisan majority of Congress worked together and passed the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993. The law said that
government ``shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of
religion'' without a compelling interest.
</P>
<P>
   -- A year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, saying Congress overstepped its authority
in interpreting the First Amendment to the Constitution. The ruling
came in Boerne vs. Flores, a zoning dispute in the small town of
Boerne, Texas, where a Catholic church wanted to expand its
facilities in the city's historic district. Attorneys for St. Peter
the Apostle Catholic Church and Archbishop Patrick Flores claimed
that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act exempted it from the
requirements of the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument of Bishop Flores was quite simply that churches
have First Amendment ... guarantees that mandate that they be
treated differently than bowling alleys and used car lots,'' said
Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty
Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. ``In effect, in the
Boerne decision, the Supreme Court said, 'No, you don't.'''
</P>
<P>
   The new Religious Liberty Protection Act is narrower in its
focus than its predecessor. Its authors have attempted to focus on
three areas they believe Congress can regulate under the
Constitution: commerce, federal funding and land use. The bill
prohibits state or local governments from undue interference with
any religious program receiving federal financial assistance or
affecting interstate commerce and specifically addresses the area
of land-use regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas will not be covered. ``It is possible, but not
absolutely certain, that home schooling won't be protected,'' said
Marc Stern, lawyer for the American Jewish Congress. ``And views
about autopsies are going to be hard to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bill has the support of more than 80 religious groups
and civil rights organizations, from the American Civil Liberties
Union to the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom From Religious Persecution Act / International
Religious Freedom Act
</P>
<P>
   In May, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a
bill to impose sanctions on foreign governments determined to be
engaging in religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opposition of many business lobbyists and the
Clinton administration, the House approved the Freedom From
Religious Persecution Act, sponsored by Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.),
co-sponsor of the bill with Rep. Christopher Smith (R-N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   A Senate bill sponsored by Sens. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and
Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) allows the administration more
flexibility. The International Religious Freedom Act would require
the president to take action against countries determined to be
violating people's religious rights but does not invoke automatic
sanctions. It would establish a bipartisan commission to monitor
religious freedom and create a new ambassadorship-at-large for
religious liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is holding hearings on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Thomas, special counsel to the National Council of
Churches, said he supported some aspects of the House bill but
favors the Senate approach. In some cases, he said, automatic
sanctions might aggravate the situation of persecuted peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think sanctions ought to be a matte of thoughtful, last
resort rather than a first resort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Land of the Southern Baptist Convention testified at Senate
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the strongest bill that can be passed out of this
Congress and sent to the president,'' he said. ``We are not
demanding that other countries follow the First Amendment liberty
standards of the United States, as much as we believe they would
all benefit from doing so. What we are interested in is that all
the nations of the world live up to the United Nations Declaration
on Human Rights, which guarantees freedom of conscience. ... They
do not have the right to imprison people and to torture people and
to rape people and to crucify people and to enslave people because
of their religious faith _ and all those things are going on in
various parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious Liberty and
</P>
<P>
   Charitable Donations Act
</P>
<P>
   On June 19, President Clinton signed legislation overwhelmingly
passed by both houses of Congress to protect contributions to
charitable and religious organizations made by people who later
file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, known as the ``tithing bill,'' adds language to
the federal bankruptcy code ensuring that institutions cannot be
forced to give the contributions of a bankrupt donor to creditors.
It protects tithes and other contributions up to 15 percent of the
debtor's annual income.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was co-written by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Calif.) and Sen.
Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) in response to a case in which a
bankruptcy trustee demanded that the Crystal Evangelical Free
Church of Minneapolis return $13,450 donated by a couple the year
before they filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The act also gives debtors the right to tithe and make
charitable donations after declaring under Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas of the National Council of Churches praised the new law.
In some cases, he said, churches had even been required to pay
penalties and interest on money they were given by people who later
went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go out and squander your life savings on booze and
cigarettes and we don't set those transactions aside,'' he said.
``But give $1,000 to your local church and the church has to give
it back after they've already paid it to the preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   School Vouchers
</P>
<P>
   In a case that may make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin on June 10 said that public education
funds can be used for vouchers to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling marks the first time a court of that level has upheld
the use of tax money for tuition at a religious primary or
secondary school.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the court overruled a lower court striking down
Gov. Tommy Thompson's plan to expand the Milwaukee Parental Choice
Program from 1,500 poor children in 23 nonreligious private schools
to 15,000 in either secular or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Wisconsin has allowed some poor children to attend
private schools at state expense.

<P>
   If a government is providing school vouchers, parents should be
able to use them at religious schools, maintains Land of the
Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to empower more and more Americans to make the same
choice that President and Mrs. Clinton made,'' he said. ``They felt
it was best for their daughter to go to a Quaker school instead of
the public schools in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barry Lynn, an ordained minister in the United Church of
Christ and executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, said the Wisconsin ruling _ if it stands _ will
mean that ``all taxpayers will, in effect, be subsidizing the
religious education of some children. When you start taking money
from taxpayers' pockets and putting it in the collection plates of
religious schools, I think that is a major religious freedom
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas of the National Council of Churches characterized the
Wisconsin case as a ``gateway decision'' and a ``huge, huge
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, chairman of the local school board in his home town of
Maryville, Tenn., opposes school vouchers but acknowledges that a
well-drafted voucher plan can ``pass constitutional muster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin decision, he said, is a signal that voucher
opponents can no longer rely on the courts to overturn voucher
plans but must fight the battle at the legislative level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to convince our legislators not that
vouchers are unconstitutional, but that they're bad public
policy,'' he said. ``We're going to have to win the debate on the
strength of the merits of our arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergy Confidentiality
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago jailers in Oregon secretly taped a conversation
between a prisoner, Conan Wayne Hale, and a priest. An Oregon judge
denied the Catholic Church's request to destroy the tape, but a
prosecutor eventually agreed not to use it at Hale's murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the case of People vs. Burnidge, the Illinois
Supreme Court ruled that information in a sexual assault case
disclosed by the defendant to a Lutheran minister could be excluded
from evidence. The minister, the Rev. John E. Golisch, is also a
clinical psychologist. Under Illinois law, a psychologist is
required to report abuse and neglect, but a minister is not.
</P>
<P>
   And just this spring, a judge in Pierce County, Wash., ruled
that a minister must divulge the confidences of Scott Anthony
Martin, who was accused of killing his own 3-month-old son. The
minister, the Rev. Rich Hamlin, pastor of the Evangelical Reformed
Church, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The lower court based its decision on the reasoning that
Hamlin's church has no formal rite of confession, such as that of
the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Stern of the American Jewish Congress says he sees a trend of
questioning the relationship between clergy and their parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years, there have been more important
priest-penitent privilege cases than in the 20 years I've been
here,'' he said. ``There's a greater willingness on the part of
government officials to press the envelope.''

BRAZIL HAS RESPECT FOR DENMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brazil should know what to expect when it meets Denmark Friday
night, and not just because the Danes conducted a lesson in soccer
tactics in a 4-1 victory over Nigeria in the second round of the
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Denmark took a 4-0 victory over Brazil in Copenhagen in
a tournament commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Dansk
Boldspil Union. The leader of the Danes was Michael Laudrup, who
made his first World Cup appearance at Mexico '86 and will make his
last international appearance during this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Laudrup might not be essential for Denmark's success _ he
boycotted the team in a dispute with former coach Richard
Moeller-Nielsen when the Danes won the 1992 European Championships
_ but there are few more respected leaders in the game. Laudrup has
played in Holland, Italy, Japan, and Spain, where he is revered by
supporters of both Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   And he would have another extremely willing taker, if it were
possible, in Brazil coach Mario Zagallo, especially after Brazil's
first-round loss to Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo has tried 11 players as midfield choreographer since
1994. None have interpreted the role the way Laudrup has. Only
Juninho, who failed to recover from a broken leg for the World Cup,
seemed able to transform Brazil's 4-4-2 into an attacking 4-3-1-2
at the right time. Leonardo has the responsibility now, but Zagallo
has not been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denmark has strong players, Michael Laudrup above all,''
Zagallo said earlier this week at training camp in Lesigny. ``In
Brazil, they think Denmark could be another Norway. However,
Denmark does not just kick the ball high. Denmark knows how to play
the short-passing game; they are much better technically.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has regained its confidence after a 4-1 victory over
Chile in which Dunga reasserted his leadership role and Ronaldo
scored twice. But Denmark will be a difficult opponent, with
Laudrup's younger brother, Brian, and young players such as Thomas
Helveg and Martin Jorgensen, who have been performing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes have had their greatest success when perceived as
underdogs. The Danish Dynamite team at Mexico '86 bombed out after
first-round wins over Uruguay (6-1) and Germany (2-0). They were
last-minute replacements for Yugoslavia and won Euro '92 in Sweden,
and they have little pressure in this World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   They prepared for the Nigeria game by water skiing, relaxing on
the beach, and hanging out at the marina in Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer. They
then surprised the Nigerians by scoring twice in the first 12
minutes in one of the most dominating performances of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the first to be surprised for how we were able to play
against Nigeria,'' Laudrup said after the game. ``Usually, after
having scored a goal we close down in defense, but this time we
were able to command the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Laudrup family has scored two of Denmark's seven goals. They
are the symbols of the Danes, sons of Finn Laudrup, a top player in
the country before players such as Allen Simonsen began making
their mark in the top professional leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark might have a reputation for solidity and stoicism, but
this team is ``unpredictable,'' according to its Swedish coach, Bo
Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect Brazil but only to a certain point,'' Johansson
said. ``If we would play with too much respect, we would not have
the possibility of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, meanwhile, have their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Romario has limited their attack, and replacement
Bebeto is being booed by the thousands of Brazilians who attend
games and practices here. A poll conducted by Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper revealed 85 percent of respondents favored Bebeto's
replacement. Clearly, they would prefer the younger, more dynamic
Denilson.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo, though, is staying with Bebeto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zagallo is like the politicians,'' Bebeto told L'Equipe, the
French sports daily. ``He doesn't need to read the polls to lead.
He knows what to do and the best way to do it.''

 &HT;    T.D. Jakes is a preacher who reaches across cultural lines
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 4: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he became known as a bishop, T.D. Jakes had another
tittle, Bible Boy.
</P>
<P>
   People in Jakes' hometown of Charleston, W.Va., gave him the
nickname because Jakes always carried a Bible to high school and
preached to imaginary congregations.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a reason Jakes held his Bible so closely. He was
looking for answers. Only 16 at the time, Jakes was watching his
father slowly die of kidney disease at home. He had to shave, feed
and clean his father virtually every day for six years until Ernest
Jakes died in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out the things that hurt us the most can become the
fuel and catalyst to propel us toward our destiny,'' Jakes said.
``Pain can make us bitter or better. I wanted to be made better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, 41, no longer preaches to imaginary congregations. He is
expected to preach to at least 40,000 people at the Georgia Dome
Friday and Saturday for his ``Woman, Thou Art Loosed!'' conference.
The event coincides with the publication of Jakes' latest book,
``The Lady, Her Lover and Her Lord'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Jakes has become the Oprah Winfrey of popular preachers. He is
black but easily reaches across racial, political and class lines.
His sermons combine fiery traditional black preaching, therapeutic
principles and earthy realism. And Jakes, like Winfrey, is not
afraid to talk about his personal struggles. (He recently waged a
public campaign to shed 100 pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   The formula has made Jakes one of the most popular preachers in
America. His television show, ``Get Ready with T.D. Jakes,'' airs
three times a week on Black Entertainment Television and the
Trinity Broadcasting Network. Jakes has written nine books which
have landed on the national Christian best-seller's list, including
``Woman, Thou Art Loosed!'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $19.95), which
sold 1.25 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Franklin, president of the Interdenominational
Theological Center in Atlanta, recalled watching Jakes preach one
broadcast from a prison courtyard, where he deftly explored how men
are damaged by childhood sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was riveted to the television screen,'' Franklin said. ``He
did it with great sensitivity and care. If someone can do this kind
of therapeutic work in a religious context, I want to affirm it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes instinctively goes after people the traditional church
ignores. His books and sermons have focused on the problems of and
been written for convicts, women and troubled youths, and have
dealt with the pressures ministers and their spouses face.
</P>
<P>
   Lorycq Mosley, a 36-year-old Atlanta woman who plans on
attending this week's conference, said Jakes is a man of
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that man,'' said Mosley. ``God has given him an
anointing to liberate women and men from past hurts and abuse. I
believe he delivers people in those areas that no one talks about,
but he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes said his sensitivity comes from a difficult childhood. His
father's death had a dramatic impact on his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose him right in the middle of my adolescence was
devastating,'' he said in a recent phone interview. ``It caused me
to take my life more seriously than other people my age.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after his father's death, Jakes said God came to him in a
dream and called him to preach. Jakes started preaching on street
corners until he found his first congregation, a storefront church.
It had 10 members. Today his church in Dallas, The Potter's House,
is one of the fastest-growing mega-churches in the country. It has
gained 14,000 members in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes' notoriety has grown along with his church. People as
diverse as NFL star Deion Sanders and Texas Gov. George Bush have
endorsed his ministry. Yet Jakes has been careful not to be too
narrowly defined.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to reveal his political affiliation and didn't
participate in the Million Man March in Washington in 1995 because
of theological differences with Nation of Islam Minster Louis
Farrakhan. And he consistently points out his church is multiracial
and nondenominational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in a box and speak to one people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jakes' family life today is good, he still must deal
with the pain that is part of living. He and his wife, Serita, have
five children. But recently, Jakes' mother, Odith, fell ill with a
brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes said his faith sometimes falters when he visits his mother
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like Bishop Jakes when I'm in the hospital room
with her,'' he said. ``I feel like her baby boy, Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's received death threats from hate groups because of the
multiracial makeup of his church. Despite that kind of hassle,
Jakes has no plans to slow down his preaching schedule.
</P>
<P>
   He still talks like Bible Boy, a smalltown kid who found comfort
and his calling in the Bible's ancient promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed me beyond my imagination,'' he said. ``I had
an insatiable thirst for the word of God. Those wells that I dug
became cisterns of living water that other people came to drink.''

CNN RETRACTS NERVE GAS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a month after reporting the dramatic news that the
United States had used deadly sarin nerve gas during a secret 1970
mission in Laos to kill American defectors, CNN Thursday apologized
and retracted the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insufficient evidence that sarin or any other deadly
gas was used,'' said CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson in a
statement that aired at noon. ``Furthermore, CNN cannot confirm
that American defectors were targeted.'' While apologizing to
viewers, Johnson said CNN ``owes a special apology to the personnel
involved in Operation Tailwind.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's retraction was based on the findings of a 54-page report
filed by noted media attorney Floyd Abrams, who was commissioned by
the network to conduct an independent investigation of the nerve
gas allegations.
</P>
<P>
   That June 7 story, which was reported by CNN producer April
Oliver and international correspondent Peter Arnett, marked the
debut of a CNN ``NewsStand'' prime time program that is a joint
collaboration between CNN and corporate partner Time magazine.
Although Time did not use its own reporters, it did publish a
version of the ``NewsStand'' story in its June 15 issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of CNN's admission, a network source said that
``NewsStand'' senior executive producer Pamela Hill has resigned,
Oliver and senior producer Jack Smith will be leaving the network,
and Arnett has been reprimanded. The Associated Press reported that
Oliver said she was fired and was standing by the accuracy of her
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In Thursday's statement, Johnson also apologized to ``our
colleagues at Time'' and asserted that ``CNN alone bears
responsibility for both the television reports and for the printed
article in the June 15 issue of Time.'' Nevertheless, Time managing
editor Walter Isaacson Thursday issued his own apology and
retraction, saying Time's and CNN's investigation ``concluded that
the facts simply do not support the allegations that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources at CNN and Time said plans were afoot to tighten the
reporting procedures on ``NewsStand'' but that there was no thought
of ending the partnership. ``We'll be a lot more careful,'' said
CNN spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that ``a very strong
relationship persists'' between Time and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The ``NewsStand'' program _ cohosted by CNN's Bernard Shaw and
Jeff Greenfield _ is part of new CNN/US president Richard Kaplan's
plan to build ratings for the network's prime time programming. And
the stunning June 7 nerve gas story _ essentially indicting the US
government for war crimes _ made an instant impact.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story, Secretary of Defense William Cohen
responded that the use of nerve gas in 1970 ``would ... have
violated our own policy at the time,'' and announced a Pentagon
investigation into the allegations. (Thursday, a Department of
Defense spokesman said that probe would continue and was expected
to conclude in a few days.)
</P>
<P>
   But nagging questions about the ``NewsStand'' story also began
to surface quickly. Former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and
General William Westmoreland expressed doubts that the United
States would have used chemical weapons in Vietnam. Numerous news
media outlets produced stories questioning CNN's findings. And one
of the cable network's military advisers, retired Air Force Major
General Perry Smith, resigned in disagreement with the story.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, CNN stood by its reporting, running a June 14
``NewsStand'' piece affirming its original story. And in an
interview with The Boston Globe, Greenfield expressed his belief
that the nerve gas piece was ``awfully solidly sourced.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Thursday's retraction, analysts wondered whether a
network with a reputation for solid journalism had done serious
damage to its credibility and overreached in an effort to launch a
flashy prime time news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can make a mistake of this magnitude and not
suffer the consequences,'' said Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman
Foundation at Harvard University. ``At what point is it going to be
possible for journalists to resist the pressure ... to compete for
revenue dollars rather than focus on quality?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Marvin Kalb, director of Harvard's Shorenstein Center on
the Press, Politics, and Public Policy: ``I cannot help but believe
that the marriage (between CNN and Time) is not going to last very
long.''

FRANCE, ITALY, OLD RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Nobody wants to play this match. Not this
early. Not in the quarterfinals. ``I'm very disappointed that we
have to play against France,'' Italian midfielder Enrico Chiesa
says. ``It's the final before the event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, who get the winner if they beat the Croats Saturday
might dispute that. But there's no doubt that someone will be going
home from the Stade de France Friday night earlier than they'd
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The French, who needed a ``golden goal'' in overtime against
Paraguay to get here, were hoping at least to make it to the
semifinals, which they managed the last two times they qualified
for the tournament. ``I have only one wish,'' says playmaker
Zinedine Zidane, back in the lineup after sitting out two matches
for his expulsion against Saudi Arabia. ``That the adventure
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, who lost the last Cup on penalty kicks, will
consider it a failure if they can't at least get a rematch with the
Brazilians here a week from Sunday. ``I truly believe that the team
which wins this match will make it to the final,'' says keeper
Gianluca Pagliuca.
</P>
<P>
   So these old neighbors, these old blue-shirted rivals _ the
Bleus and the Azzurri _ are prepared to go 120 minutes and beyond
if they have to. ``Only one thing matters to the Italians and
that's winning, no matter how,'' says French captain Didier
Deschamps, who plays for Juventus in Italy's Serie A.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Azzurri (17-6-7) have dominated a rivalry that goes
back to 1910, the Bleus are 3-0-1 with three shutouts in their last
four meetings, including the ``perfect game'' they threw at Italy
in the second round in 1986. And France will be playing in its
national stadium before 80,000 people _ most of whom will be
wearing red, white, and blue. ``France is favored,'' concedes
Italian defender Moreno Torricelli, ``but I think we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   The French have only allowed one goal (a penalty by Denmark) in
four matches, but they haven't faced a team of Italy's quality or a
striker like Christian Vieri, who's scored five goals in the
tournament, including the killer finish that beat Norway and got
the Azzurri here.
</P>
<P>
   The French, who rely on a grudging defense and an opportunistic
midfield to beat people, have nobody like Vieri, and it worries
them. But at least they'll have Zidane, who watched in torment from
the bench as his mates sweated blood to beat the Paraguayans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard, terrible even,'' says Zidane, who was 14 the
last time France played in the Cup and feared that this one might
end without him. ``The longer the match went on, the longer I
suffered. Now, this match is the most important of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Italians can shut down Zidane, they think they'll win,
especially since attackers Christophe Dugarry and Thierry Henry and
midfielder Emmanuel Petit are all gimpy. Neither Zidane nor most of
his mates are any mystery to the Azzurri _ seven French players,
including most of their stars, play for Italian clubs, where their
teammates call them `galeti' (little roosters). ``They hold no
secrets for us,'' says Italian coach Cesare Maldini.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the Italians for the French. They know the Vieris and
Baggios and DiBiagios by heart and they know the ``kings of 1-0''
will play them the same way they play everybody else _ with a
classic counterattacking style that waits for a mistake and pounces
on it. ``All they want is one master stroke for a goal,'' says
Zidane. ``And then, it's `I'm closing the box.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians did that against the Norwegians, who'd beaten the
Brazilians with two late goals. The French, who know something
about countering themselves, are prepared to play that way, too. It
will be, predicts defender Laurent Blanc, ``un grand rendez-vous.''
They'd just rather have had it next weekend.

<HEADLINE>
FOR FRANCE, WINNING IS A NOBLE CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ ``So, then, who will win the match between
France and Italie?'', an elegant grandmere asked a foreigner over
her lunchtime rabbit at the Cafe des Federations in Lyon the other
day. ``France,'' she was told. ``Really?'' she replied, in
semi-disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   It has been so long since the French soccer team won a big match
that the very idea raises Gallic eyebrows. What the people are used
to is failure. Noble, even stylish failure, but failure.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Italians in Friday's World Cup quarterfinals in the
Stade de France will be a challenge. Winning the Cup here a week
from Sunday, with president Jacques Chirac watching from the
stands, would be ``un reve'' _ a dream.
</P>
<P>
   What the French are accustomed to from their Bleus (from their
blue jerseys) in the World Cup is ``un cauchemar'' _ a nightmare.
The loss to Germany on penalty kicks in the 1982 semifinals after
leading, 3-1, in overtime. The loss to Germany in the 1986
semifinals after beating Brazil and Italy. Failing to qualify for
the 1990 tournament. Failing to qualify again last time by losing
to the Israelis after they'd already popped the champagne at
halftime, then losing again to the Bulgarians in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the French are playing at home on a free pass
with an easy draw in familiar stadia packed with their own fans
(the organizing committee, headed by former star Michel Platini,
made sure of that), everyone from Normandy to Languedoc is crossing
his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, all the advantages that come with home cookin' have
just jacked up the pressure and the anxiety on the hosts. ``France
is the team to beat,'' Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca
proclaimed. ``If they can't win this time, I don't believe they'll
ever win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The French have never won the Cup, haven't even reached the
final. If they can at least get past the Italians and Germans and
get a date with champion Brazil, Les Bleus will have made history.
``To enter into football legend,'' says midfielder Youri Djorkaeff,
``we must qualify for the final.''
</P>
<P>
   That would make up for the shock of 1982, which still makes
Frenchmen grind their teeth. Even after German keeper Harald
Schumacher had leveled Patrick Battiston with a flying elbow to the
face and gone unpunished _ regarded as one of the greatest
injustices in Cup history _ the French managed to get the match
into overtime and (incroyable!) go up by two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Germans managed to draw even and won in a shootout
that left Les Bleus weeping on the field and their countrymen in
shock. The disappointment and the bitterness endures. When
L'Equipe, the French sporting daily, sent a writer across the
border last month to do a retrospective, Karl-Heinz Forster, who
played for the Germans that day, greeted him with: ``So, how's
Monsieur Battiston doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the French came to Mexico with a better team
and the Germans took them out cold, 2-0. No elbows, no shootouts.
ADIOS MUCHACHOS, a headline said back home.
</P>
<P>
   So if their countrymen express surprise that Les Bleus are
favored in a big one, it's that history has taught them to expect
the worst. Even though the French have been playing soccer since
1872 (Jules Rimet and Henri Delaunay actually concocted the World
Cup), they've achieved relatively little, even on the Continent.
They've won one European title (in 1984, as hosts) and their clubs
lost six Champions Cup finals before Olympique Marseille won in
1993. Their best players (captain Didier Deschamps, Zinedine
Zidane, Djorkaeff, Lilian Thuram) play for Italian clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer has never inspired the fever here that it has in Italy,
in Germany, in England, in Spain. The French had to build the
80,000-seat Stade de France because they didn't have a stadium big
enough to stage the final. Platini, exasperated by the lack of
cooperation from the government, from corporations, from unions
during the buildup to the tournament, threw up his hands. ``France
hasn't really understood the importance of the World Cup,'' he
sighed.
</P>
<P>
   The Coupe du Monde falls somewhere behind wine, cheese, amour,
smoking, and the Tour de France among national passions.
Three-quarters of women polled said that they could care less about
the Cup _ but that it would be a pity if Les Bleus didn't win it.
So despite the insouciance, there is an undeniable burden on the
national team. ``There has been a huge amount of pressure on us
right from the start of the World Cup,'' coach Aime Jacquet
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Beating South Africa, 3-0, and Saudi Arabia, 4-0, only jacked up
expectations. When the French edged the Danes to win their group _
and got unknown Paraguay instead of feared Nigeria in the second
round (``YOU SAID PARAGUAY?'' a headline wondered) _ ``le reve''
began in earnest. ``Even I am beginning to dream,'' acknowledged
Chirac, who's been taping the matches on his VCR.
</P>
<P>
   But the Paraguay match was a purgatory. With playmaker Zidane
sitting out the match because he'd taken a stupid red card against
the Saudis, Les Bleus struggled. They ended up locked in a
scoreless draw (``They looked paralyzed,'' Italian coach Cesare
Maldini observed) that went into overtime, where defender Laurent
Blanc won it with a golden goal.
</P>
<P>
   LA DELIVRANCE, L'Equipe proclaimed, saying that a loss to the
Paraguayans would have been ``une immense catastrophe.'' In the
locker room, the French players embraced in joy and relief. ``We
had tears in our eyes,'' said Djorkaeff. ``Nobody could speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mondiale, keeper Fabien Barthez said, has been an emotional
roller coaster for Les Bleus. After a dozen years off the world
stage, nobody knew what to expect from them, especially after a
blah 1-0 victory over Finland in a tuneup days before the
tournament. Trying to win the Cup with this team, playing this way,
a French columnist mused, was like trying to climb Everest in
espadrilles.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the blowout of the South Africans amid a howling
Mistral in the opener in Marseille, with 60,000 fans singing `La
Marseillaise'. ``The public, like the wind, swept us along,'' said
midfielder Emmanuel Petit. Then came the advancement, then La
Delivrance.
</P>
<P>
   And now? ``Everybody's expecting to see us in the final against
Brazil,'' says Deschamps. ``But don't forget, there are other
matches to be won.''
</P>
<P>
   Italie, everyone agrees, will be ``un match dur.'' Even though
France hasn't lost to the neighbors since 1978. Even though the
Italians have struggled here, too. Even though Djorkaeff has
declared: ``This World Cup belongs to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The French may have dreamed it up, but the Cup has always been
that for them _ a dream _ and they expect to suffer mightily for
it. Beating the Italians here merely gets them the Germans, whom
the French haven't defeated in Cup play in 40 years. That's why the
elegant grandmeres raise their eyebrows when you tell them France
will win a big one. So, how's Monsieur Battiston doing?

ANNAN SAYS NIGERIA WILL FREE POLITICAL PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday
that Nigeria's new military government pledged to release all
remaining political prisoners, among them Moshood K.O. Abiola, who
was jailed after apparently winning the presidential election in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Annan made the announcement at a news conference in Abuja, the
Nigerian capital, after meeting with the country's president, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said. ``The government will make an
announcement at the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   No official government announcement followed Annan's remarks
Thursday. But in London, Wura Abiola, one of Abiola's daughters,
said that she believed his release was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola agreed to drop his claim to the presidency based on the
1993 vote, which the government annulled, Annan said Thursday
before leaving Abuja for Ghana. Abiola apparently has made no
promises about future elections, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him more realistic than some of us outside,'' said
Annan, who met Abiola on Tuesday. ``Chief Abiola realizes that a
lot has changed.'' Annan said that Nigerians appeared to want new,
democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   A vote had been scheduled for Aug. 1, but only one name was on
the ballot, Gen. Sani Abacha, the former military ruler, who died
suddenly on June 8. Abubakar has said that he would turn over power
to an elected civilian government by Oct. 1, in keeping with the
timetable set by Abacha. The government has not announced whether
the August election date is firm and whether it would allow genuine
opposition candidates to run.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Ms. Abiola, a management consultant, said that her
father would need time to get back in touch with his family and
with politics, and take time to reflect on his future political
career. Abiola had been denied reading material in prison and was
kept as isolated as possible from even his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola had four wives and four sets of children. All have united
in campaigning for his release. One of his wives, Kudirat Abiola,
was gunned down execution-style while working to have her husband
released.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abiola said that family members have taken note of reports
that Abiola has renounced his presidential claim, but want to hear
the decision from him, and they want him to be given some breathing
space to decide what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very happy to see my father and start to
rebuild on a personal level all those dimensions in my father's
life and our lives,'' she said. ``We have to see that we get more
than a promise, that we actually get him home and can see him and
talk to him. Nothing will substitute for hearing his words and
understanding where he is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to get in touch with all the relevant Nigerian
parties,'' she said. ``Only after that can he make a decision. The
Nigerian people will start to express what they desire out of my
father in the month after his release. It's only after he weighs
the different demands, after he understands the different
implications, that he can then re-evaluate his position. Hopefully
the people will give him time to take stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, a wealthy businessman from southern Nigeria who is a
Yoruba and a Muslim, could still face difficulties if he decided to
run in a new election because the all-powerful military is
dominated by northerners.
</P>
<P>
   But some moderates in the military establishment have apparently
come to realize that Abiola cannot be sidelined indefinitely and
will have to be brought into the political process at some point if
Nigeria is to move toward a more democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Nigerians have borne much of the military government's
repression. In 1995, a group of nine southern environmental
activists, including the playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa, were executed
for opposing development of their region. Nigeria, Africa's richest
and potentially most powerful country, already under some
international sanctions for annulling the 1993 vote, was suspended
from the Commonwealth because of the executions.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Emeka Anyaoku, a
Nigerian based in London, said Thursday that he expected Abubakar
to outline a democratic program for Nigeria that will allow the
country to be readmitted.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin welcomed
the news about prisoner releases and said that a high-level
American delegation would be going to Nigeria this weekend for
meetings with Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, Nigerians have suspected that talks may
have been going on with Abiola. Annan's visit may have provided the
opportunity to make a public breakthrough in his case, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Abubakar has already freed 26 other political
prisoners, including Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military
ruler who turned over government to civilians in the 1970s. In
1995, he was imprisoned by Abacha for campaigning again for
civilian government. Human rights groups estimate that Nigeria is
still holding between 150 and 250 political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Some Nigerians have suggested that Abiola may be encouraged by
followers to reinstate his claim to the presidency after being
freed. &QL;

 &HT;    Neither monsters nor meteors can bring Big Apple to its knees
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York, New York, it's a wonderful town.
</P>
<P>
   The filming's up, and the buildings are down.
</P>
<P>
   Finito. Wiped out like some out-of-town pedestrian caught in the
cross hairs of a careening Checker Cab.
</P>
<P>
   And to think it happened right before our eyes. In
``Armageddon,'' the latest summer blockbuster, meteor-spawned
mayhem includes everything from caved-in subway tunnels to a
decapitated Chrysler Building.
</P>
<P>
   All this, just when the city had managed to put itself back
together again after ``Godzilla's'' late May rampage. Even then,
Gothamites were still knocking the water from their ears, courtesy
of ``Deep Impact's'' April tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   You get the point. Fast food tie-ins and way-too-loud Surround
Sound still count, but it seems the top item for this summer's
biggest movies is a soon-to-be-obliterated New York City setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a taste for it, it's a very hard thing not to
do,'' admitted ``Godzilla'' co-writer and producer Dean Devlin.
``It's quite addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   What Devlin considers a sort of backhanded compliment to New
York _ disaster films work best when destroying instantly
recognizable, incredibly powerful cities, after all _ isn't an
entirely new phenomenon. His own ``Independence Day'' took out New
York two years ago. And ``King Kong'' attacked the Empire State
Building way back in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a prolonged pummeling of the sort that's got some
New Yorkers _ hold onto your hats _ almost at a loss for words.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like `a-w-w-W-W-W'!'' ``Godzilla'' actor and Queens
native Hank Azaria recalled about seeing his lumbering co-star
flatten Madison Square Garden and other local landmarks. ``I love
this city, and they made it look so real that it actually was
disturbing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   You want disturbing? The art deco-style Chrysler Building has
gone from the ``Godzilla'' frying pan directly into the
``Armageddon'' fire, getting destroyed on-screen twice within a
mere six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't compliment me, but it doesn't make me nervous
either,'' said Sol Bissu, who works at Chrysler Camera in the
needle-nosed skyscraper. ``It's true almost anything can happen in
New York. But not that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York's tabloid Daily News was nervous enough when
``Godzilla'' was released to report on how the city would handle an
attack by a 200-foot lizard. Call in King Kong, joked the emergency
management director, sounding almost like he was enjoying this.
</P>
<P>
   Well, why not? Moviemaking in New York is up about 35 percent
from five years ago. Meanwhile, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's office
suggests that all those celluloid monsters and meteors aren't
attacking New York so much as reinforcing its image as a vibrant
mecca for all sorts of overachievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only natural that filmmakers would choose to set and film
their movies in the most famous, exciting and diverse city in the
world,'' said deputy press secretary Dwight Williams. ``No matter
what the disaster, it gives us great exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Azaria, for one, doesn't sound entirely convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine,'' he sighed, ``some people will cheer at New York
being so rampaged.''

 &HT;    FIRES ARE FLORIDA'S WORST, BUT NOT NATION'S
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The wildfires raging in Florida may be the worst in
the state's history, emergency fire officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst episode of fires in a drought situation
we've ever seen,'' said Barbara Doran, spokeswoman for the Florida
State Emergency Operations Center. ``The record-breaking
temperatures, the dry weather and high winds have led to a very
serious disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The blazes that continue to spread through Florida have consumed
more than 280,000 acres since June 1, according to Jack Conner, an
information officer for the U.S. Forest Service. Only half as much
acreage is destroyed statewide in an average full year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has had more than 1,900 separate wildfires since the end
of May, and at least 96 homes and 57 other buildings have been
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Only one event in Florida's wildfire history even compares,
Conner said. On May 17, 1985, in an event that became known as
``Black Friday,'' about 100,000 acres were charred, 143 homes were
destroyed and more than than 400 buildings were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's fires have lasted much longer than any previous
year's and are much more widespread, officials said. Nearly every
county in the state has reported an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which
tracks wildfires and publishes the monthly fire threat for the
entire United States, said Thursday that while the total loss of
acreage in the Florida fires so far is not unusually high, the fact
that tens of thousands of people are being evacuated and property
is being damaged increases the severity of the event.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, where seasonal wildfires regularly
consume expensive homes in one of the nation's largest media
markets, the disasters regularly become a national spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in 1969 one rash of fires in Idaho took 219,000
acres and another incident in Nevada burned 150,000 acres. But
there was little or no property loss in those incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there isn't property or lives at stake, you almost stand
back and watch, `` said Lorraine Buck, spokeswoman for the Boise,
Idaho-based NIFC. ``There are people's homes burning, so there's
national sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Florida fires dominate the network newscasts, at least
15 major blazes are continuing to spread at scattered sites
elsewhere, including Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and
Alaska. There are nearly 4,300 firefighters battling fires
nationwide, according to the NIFC.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the NIFC tracked more than 33,000 wildfires in
the United States through June 29. Nearly 742,000 acres have been
burned.

COMMENTARY: JUDGMENT IN BEIJING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president stood to speak to about 100 dissidents gathered in
the U.S. Embassy. He said this to them:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``While we press for human rights through diplomatic channels
you press with your very lives, day in, day out, year after year,
risking your jobs, your homes, your all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then this: ``Coming here, being with you, looking into your
faces, I have to believe the history of this troubled century will
indeed be redeemed in the eyes of God and man.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan said many things during his visit to Moscow
that May of 1988, but those passages will be remembered by fighters
for freedom willing to risk their own _ and by those privileged by
their own liberty to help them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, President Clinton, in Beijing, could make no
such statements. This president, born and raised under liberty,
elected in liberty, had no meetings with dissidents, spoke no words
about political prisoners by the thousands existing on gruel and
beatings, and workers by the million slaving in ``re-education''
prison-factories.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This president, who proclaims love for children and women's
rights, did not mention what confronts every Chinese woman _ the
need for official approval to deliver a child. He did not mention
the punishment for carrying to birth more than the allotted one, or
sometimes two: forced abortion. It may take a village to raise a
child, as Mrs. Clinton wrote, but in the China they admire it takes
only one official to order the child extinguished in the womb; no
choice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beijing gave Clinton air time before censoring replays. When he
called his friends in the United States to ask `howmIdoin' back
there, they said he was a smash. He was; the U.S. press has been
spun so often that now it sometimes just spins itself. The Clinton
``openness'' we heard and read about was to candor as Torquemada to
tolerance.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He arrived bearing payoff to China. He offered the chance to
make Tibet disappear forever into China, without any Beijing
concessions. President Jiang Zemin of China said he would talk with
the Dalai Lama, maybe. The Dalai Lama praised both men. He fears
that if the Chinese never allow him to return to Tibet, when he
dies Beijing will choose and rear the next Dalai Lama or simply
eliminate Tibetan Buddhism completely.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Tibet, dreams of national and religious freedom will not long
survive any Clinton-Jiang deal, nor will Tibet's international
support groups. But perhaps at least the honored memory of the
half-century struggle by Tibetans and the Dalai Lama against
genocide will endure despite decisions that China and the United
States force upon them.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``debate'' heard by Chinese, it was Jiang who openly laid
down realities to them and the world. The Communist justification
for the Tiananmen slaughter stands; objecting Chinese can go to
jail. On foreign complaints about human rights: None of your
business. And nothing, particularly not the presence of this U.S.
president, can save a Chinese dissident from arrest when the police
choose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ he concentrated on concealment. When he had the chance
to use public time to speak up against the arrests of Roman
Catholic and Protestant clergymen and congregants who do not accept
the official ``patriotic'' churches or Beijing's dictates about
liturgy, sermons, clerical appointments and disavowal by Catholics
of papal authority and appointments, the president was mute. Nor
did he speak of the millions who attend underground ``house
churches'' rather than accept Beijing's rule over God. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in all those public meetings Clinton kept his mouth shut
about Chinese sales of nuclear weaponry, and Beijing's thefts of
American missile technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Chinese economy, he said nothing about the various
special efficiencies that so smartly increase production, profits
and exports: 17-cent-an-hour labor, no unions, iron factory
discipline, forced labor, the waiting cell _ all now handsomely
financed by Western investment, and imports.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A smash. The Beijing-U.S. axis was forged, based on Politburo
concepts about the role of human rights and political democracy:
zero. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then _ then, Clinton announced that China's economic and
``freedom'' course was ``morally right.'' He said that. The
president will go home. On Sundays he will go to church. The Bible
will be in his hand, and on his soul will be that judgment.

BLAIR CONDEMNS ATTACKS ON 10 CATHOLIC CHURCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair came to Northern
Ireland Thursday to condemn arson attacks on 10 Catholic churches
and to seek a compromise over a disputed parade that is expected to
cause trouble Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that acts of arson across Northern Ireland early
Thursday were a coordinated effort by Protestant extremists. Three
of the churches were destroyed. Police suspect the the Loyalist
Volunteer Force, a Protestant paramilitary group, but in a
statement the group denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   As he surveyed the damage at St. James Church near Aldergrove
Airport on his arrival, Blair condemned the attacks and tried to
comfort one of the parish priests, the Rev. John Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the past,'' Blair told reporters, indicating the
rubble. As he was departing, he said he was leaving the past for
``the future,'' his first visit to the Northern Ireland Assembly
after its inaugural sitting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was at Castle Buildings at Stormont, where last April he
presided over his most important achievement as prime minister _
the signing of the Good Friday political settlement in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair's hastily arranged visit suggests he fears the
progress marked by the agreement is threatened by increasing
tension over Sunday's expected confrontation between Protestants
and Catholics in Portadown, 30 miles southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton is involved in the behind-the-scenes
efforts to avert violence there. In an interview, John Hume, the
moderate Catholic nationalist leader, said Clinton had called him
from China ``asking if there was anything he could do.'' White
House officials confirmed that Clinton has been telephoning various
people in Northern Ireland, pleading for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Parades Commission that was created by Blair's
administration to arbitrate the thorny issue of Protestant parades
passing through Catholic neighborhoods has barred the Orange Order
from marching down the Catholic Garvaghy Road on Sunday. Catholic
nationalists consider the parade offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, named for William of Orange, an Ulster Protestant
hero, have vowed to defy that ban and say they will gather en masse
until they are allowed to follow the same route they have trod each
year since 1807. There have been standoffs the last three years and
widespread rioting the last two after residents were beaten off the
Garvaghy Road by police so that Orangemen could march.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Blair arrived, there was a flurry of
behind-the-scenes mediation going on, as the two new leaders of the
Assembly, First Minister David Trimble and his deputy, Seamus
Mallon, brought in leading clergymen and Orangemen in an attempt to
work out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Blair used the opportunity to congratulate Trimble and Mallon
and to pose with them for photographers. While Blair told reporters
he was not here to negotiate the parade ban, Downing Street
officials had earlier said the prime minister would only go to
Northern Ireland if he thought there was a chance of resolving the
looming confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Garvaghy Road, residents complained they were being
left out of the loop. Breandan Mac Cionnaith, the leader of the
residents' group, said no one had involved them in the secret
talks. Irish government officials talked to Mac Cionnaith Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Trimble had accompanied Catholic and Protestant
churchmen to St. James, where he called the arson attacks ``an
appalling act.''

COMMENTARY: DOWNWARD FROM PARADISE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hamilton, Madison, Franklin, Washington, Adams and Jefferson had
these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have any polls.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't have any focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the advantage of a photo op.
</P>
<P>
   Never interrupted a trip to Asia by stopping off in Alaska, like
Reagan, so they could have their pictures taken saying ``Hi
there!'' to the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Hamilton had
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't have brilliant campaign consultants warning them that
ideology was poison.
</P>
<P>
   Had nobody at all to tell them: ``Lay off the ideas, Jamie. Keep
the old lip buttoned about ideology, Ben, George, John, Tom and
Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't have any television instructors to make them get their
teeth capped, hair dyed, lips painted, cheeks rouged.
</P>
<P>
   All they had were these ideas they'd picked up from _
</P>
<P>
   _ reading!
</P>
<P>
   Reading books!
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison
were different from Clinton, Gingrich, Gore, Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Different from Bush, Quayle and Reagan, too.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison had
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   They knew philosophy. They had ideology. They had ideas about
how government should work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, Gingrich, Gore and Lott, Bush, Quayle and
Reagan, they didn't have speechwriters to help them drive audiences
half-mad with joy by uttering vacuities like ``Read my lips'' and
``It's morning in America'' and ``I feel your pain.''
</P>
<P>
   When they needed a tough piece of writing done they had to
decide for themselves what they wanted to say, then lean over
Jefferson's shoulder to make sure he was saying it the way they
wanted it said.
</P>
<P>
   They were familiar with the best writing of the 18th century.
All those French intellectuals. And John Locke!
</P>
<P>
   Locke with those ideas about mankind's most precious rights:
life, liberty and property. They loved property. They were men of
property, but they knew that ``life, liberty and property''
detracted from the nobility of their own ideas, which were more
daring than Locke's.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have extravagantly paid image advisers to warn them
that unpropertied people were not likely to be enthusiastic about
dying for property rights.
</P>
<P>
   But they had common sense. They changed ``property'' to
``pursuit of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison and Franklin
were free to have ideas because they had no pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Gingrich, Gore and Lott, Bush, Quayle and Reagan did
not need to have ideas.
</P>
<P>
   When they needed to know what people wanted them to say they
asked a pollster to find out, then they told people what the
pollster said people wanted them to say.
</P>
<P>
   Having no need of ideas, Clinton, Gingrich, Gore and Lott, Bush,
Quayle and Reagan had no ideas. If chided for their idealessness,
they said, ``It will play in Peoria.''
</P>
<P>
   They had consultants, writers, lawyers, image creators,
hairdressers, press agents, public-relations experts, spin doctors,
haberdashery advisers, court jesters and cosmetic dentists.
</P>
<P>
   They had Air Force One. They could move all over the world so
fast that they had no time to have ideas, even if their advisers
had permitted them to have ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, Franklin and Washington had
no Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't even have U.S. Cavalry Horse One. Still they traveled far
and slow.
</P>
<P>
   Primitive was the manner of their conveyance. This compelled
them to look closely at places they traversed and to talk to a
great variety of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   It gave them a great deal of time to think. They had ideas.
</P>
<P>
   With many others nearly as remarkable they constituted one of
the most extraordinary bands of men in world political history.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, Franklin, Washington and Adams _
they had ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Gingrich, Gore and Lott, Bush, Quayle and Reagan?
Lamentation will do no good. It is not given to every generation to
have a golden age.

   BOEING-INSPECTIONS (Undated) The government ordered immediate
inspections on engines running the newest Boeing 737s Thursday
after broken engine parts prompted two inflight engine shutdowns
last week. The ``telegraphic airworthiness directive,'' second only
in urgency to an emergency directive, orders immediate inspections
on 46 engines installed on 23 U.S. airliners, 13 of which are owned
by Southwest Airlines. Nine others are owned by Continental
Airlines and one is owned by Eastwind Airlines. The directive also
states that the engine part in question, the accessory gearbox
starter gearshaft, must be replaced on all of the aircraft by Sept.
1 or within the next 750 flight hours, whichever comes first.

rendezvous with a comet and collect dust from within 100 miles of
its nucleus. It will also be collecting interstellar dust along the

Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-LIFE-STYLE (Undated) _ When mutual fund companies
started pushing so-called life-style and life-cycle funds, they
seemed like sure-fire hits: single funds that were meant to
simplify the decision-making process for befuddled investors.
Essentially, these funds would plunk an investor into a portfolio
with a mix of stocks, bonds and cash tailor-made to his investing
time horizon, eliminating the need to concern himself with
complicated issues like risk or asset allocation. The problem is
that investors, by and large, haven't warmed up to the idea. By
Abby Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-CLOSED-END (Undated) _ With closed-end funds developing
a reputation as a dysfunctional branch of the fund family tree,
shareholder activists have grown restive. That doesn't bother some
analysts, who feel that many such funds look like bargains as of
late. By Rick Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BENCHMARKS (Undated) _ So, how's your portfolio doing?
Good question. The fact is that you won't have a clue if you
measure your mutual fund's performance against the wrong benchmark.
Doing so can lead to Godzilla-size mistakes, like holding onto
losers or selling winners. By Noelle Knox.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-VANGUARD (Undated _ To hear John J. Brennan tell it,
there's really nothing much afoot at the Vanguard Group, the giant
fund company he heads. Vanguard, for example, definitely does not
intend to join the rush to build a financial services conglomerate,
he said. By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-DOMESTIC (Undated) _ With the stock market as hot as a
firecracker, pushing the Standard &AMP; Poors 500 index to a record
high, why aren't mutual fund holders cheering? Because it is no fun
to incur losses in your fund holdings while the indexes race ever
higher. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-IAI-BALANCED (Undated) _ The IAI Balanced fund has
proven to be the best performer in the quarter of all stocks funds
trcked by the New York Timnes and the best domestic hybrid fund
over all. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-PORTFOLIOS (Undated) _ It has been one wild ride. Only
an unrepentant bull could have scooped up every dollar from the
red-hot stock market during the last five years as the Dow Jones
industrial average flirted with the 9,000 mark from the mid-3,000s.
Put simply, this time the theory of diversifying investments did
not work. Carefully balancing big stocks with smaller ones, or
American issues with international issues, was a waste of time.
Investors would have been better off sweeping their money into
Vanguard's S&AMP;P 500-stock index fund and going to the beach. By
Carole Gould.

   EARN-INTERNS (Undated) _ There's a good deal to be said for
internships. Some say they give the intern a head start on a
permanent job. Then again, some interns, working for meager or no
wages, say they are a head start on slavery. By Lawrence Van
Gelder.

   CAR-SMART-CORVETTE (Undated) _ No modern car on the American
road is more red-, white- and blue-blooded than the Chevrolet
Corvette. Introduced as a 1953 model, it was Americas first true,
mass-produced sportscar _ the United States' answer to the
pint-size roadsters that were being imported from Europe. And the
Corvette remains the only American sports car to stand the test of
time. A million-plus Corvettes have been built in more than four
decades, more than any other single sports car ever. By Michelle
Krebs.

   ABOUT-CARS-CADILLAC (Undated) _ After decades in which Cadillac

   HONG KONG _ President Clinton's low-key meetings on Friday with
Hong Kong opposition legislators will be his only chance to hear
critics of the ruling Chinese communist party regime during his
nine-day trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing to fly home late Friday for a Fourth of July greeting
at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington at dawn on Saturday,
Clinton spoke about how Hong Kong's still limited democracy can
inspire the long-term future for the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
   In a dinner toast a few hours after arriving here Thursday
night, Clinton said the future ``will be difficult, but most of it
will be very good'' if China is able to ``stay on the right side of
history.'' He referred to his remarks last fall when he told
President Jiang Zemin that defending China's 1989 crackdown on
democracy advocates put him on the wrong side of history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was exchanging toasts with Tung Chee-hwa, the
Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong who immediately
abolished the elected legislature last summer, when Britain turned
its one-time colony back to Chinese control after more than 150
years of British rule.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton was scheduled to meet privately with the
leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, Martin Lee, and other
democratic activists who are working for multi-party democracy in
the only bit of China where any high-level democratic elections are
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a fiery lawyer, told journalists: ``I was impressed by the
president's joint press conference with Jiang Zemin and believe the
fact that it was televised live in China was a significant
development for the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even here, only one third of the Legislative Council members are
elected now. The rest are appointed by pro-Beijing professional and
social groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's talks with members of what in Hong Kong is a tolerated
opposition fall short of qualifying as a meeting with dissidents.
The White House vacillated in the days before Clinton left on his
China tour about whether the president would have face-to-face
talks with any dissidents who face arrest or labor camp terms for
speaking out against Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Clinton met neither with political dissidents
nor with leaders of China's burgeoning underground churches.
</P>
<P>
   His ostensible objective was to insulate dissidents living in
China from being harassed in the future. However, clearly another
part of the calculation was trying to spare his Chinese official
hosts from the negative publicity that would attend such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The White House even tried to downplay the meetings with Lee and
others in Hong Kong's elected opposition, refusing to allow
American or Chinese television to film any part of the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in Hong Kong, Clinton could have met some of the most
effective human rights monitors keeping track of what is happening
to dissidents on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Lu Si Qing, for example, runs a shoestring operation called
International Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movements in
China, which reports frequently to journalists by fax or cellphone
about Chinese dissidents who are arrested or simply disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lu's organization that put out news of several dissidents
detained in the days before Clinton arrived in China, detentions
which prompted angry White House reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Lu escaped from detention on the mainland and gained asylum in
Hong Kong while Britain still was in control. His organization is
considered subversive by Chinese authorities, but the observance of
free speech and free press here in Hong Kong has kept him from
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people not very famous, the police can do many things,''
he said in a recent interview. ``For the very famous, the Western
countries help them. For the thousands who nobody knows their
names, how can the Western nations care about them?''
</P>
<P>
   A high profile meeting with Clinton would provide at least some
shield of protection for activists like Lu.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival in Hong Kong came one day after the special
autonomous region celebrated the first anniversary of the handover
back to China.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials opened the new Chek Lap Kok International
Airport in conjunction with the anniversary on Wednesday, and Air
Force One was the first plane with passengers to land at the
airport Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential party was greeted with lion-costumed dancers,
drums and gongs.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Clinton's arrival, a group of about 20
anti-American demonstrators staged a protest in front of the U.S.
consulate to denounce Washington's security pact with Japan, which
allows U.S. forces to use Japanese logistical support in case of
regional crises.
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator held up a cartoon caricature of Clinton in the
shape of a turtle, something considered an obnoxious insult in
China.

CANYON (Undated) - In an unusual twist, nine major environmental
groups are pushing to have more, not less, development near the
main entrance to Grand Canyon National Park. In a statement
released Thursday, the environmentalists are backing plans by
Canyon Forest Village, a Scottsdale partnership, to build more
hotels and stores than proposed by the U.S. Forest Service. It is a
unique situation, they contend, prompted by unique circumstances:
Preservation of a global treasure and Arizona's namesake national
park. The Canyon's delicate ecosystem is threatened, they say, by a
compromise development plan they expect to be pushed by the U.S.
Forest Service. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RAINBOW (Springerville, Ariz.) - A frenetic beat rose from dozens
of pounding drums as a milling, tie-dyed crowd of Rainbow warriors
danced and sang, wildly proclaiming their message of freedom,
harmony and togetherness. It's a strange and unlikely scene on this
isolated Alpine meadow deep in the Ponderosa pines where more than
17,000 men, women and children, plus thousands of wandering dogs,
have come for the 27th annual Rainbow Family of Living Light
National Gathering. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PLAYBOY (Phoenix) - Jail inmates can ogle again. The federal
appeals court in San Francisco rules that Maricopa County Sheriff
Joe Arpaio, the self-styled ``world's toughest sheriff,'' can't ban
magazines showing frontal nudity from the county jail. The reason:
The ban could be used against ``National Geographic'' and classic
art works as well as ``Playboy'' and ``Hustler.''  &QL;

BUMPED (Phoenix) _ Wanna earn some extra money on your summer
vacation? All you have to do is pack plenty of snacks and
magazines, get to the airport early and volunteer to be bumped from
your flight. If the airline needs your seat, you'll get a free
ticket or voucher, often worth more than you paid for the
ticket.All for a little flexibility and patience. It's shaping up
as a great summer to get bumped from your plane. By DAWN

CLINTON'S CHINA TRIP A POLITICAL SUCCESS, MANY IN GOP CONCEDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moving in `i' category; with
CHINA-CLINTON) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before President Clinton's return from China,
many prominent Republicans concede that the trip has been a
political success that could deprive their party of a potent
election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, Republicans said they still have
serious questions about the wisdom of Clinton's policy approaches
toward Beijing. But as a political matter, there seems to be a
consensus among Republicans that, at least for now, Clinton has
overcome fears among Democrats that the trip would expose the
president to damaging attacks on issues ranging from human rights
to exporting satellite technology to China to campaign finance
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a huge success,'' said Jack Kemp, the 1996
Republican vice presidential nominee, who faults the president for
seeming to side with China against Japan. ``That presents a problem
to those Republicans or conservatives who want to make it an issue.
I can't imagine that there's any great political benefit to be
derived, because the president handled himself very well.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lilley, the ambassador to China in the Bush
administration, put it this way: ``Clinton got control of the
agenda. He ran it like a campaign. And he made it into a political
success story.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he thought the president has ``swept under the rug'' the
issue of Chinese military modernization, Lilley said he has advised
Republican congressional leaders to hold their fire and rethink how
to handle China as a political issue. ``I've counseled them to pull
back on this one. Don't hit Clinton at his high point _ or it's
going to sound like sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks ago, House Speaker Newt Gingrich had called upon Clinton
to postpone the trip until the Justice Department determined
whether two U.S. companies gave sensitive missile information to
Beijing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking to reporters in San Antonio on Wednesday, where he
was attending a Republican fund raising event, he praised Clinton.
``I think the president did a pretty good job talking on Chinese
radio and TV,'' Gingrich asserted. ``It's less expensive to be
friends than to be enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Galen, a phrase maker to the speaker, said, ``They set the
bar so low for success that the arrival ceremony looked like a
limbo dance _ and he did better than expectations. You have to say
this has been a successful trip for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said of the Republicans: ``I think they've lost it as an
issue. People understand that one-quarter of the world's population
is sitting in the middle of that Asian economy. We've got to know
them better, and they've got to be partners of ours.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One explanation for Gingrich's praise is that he has been trying
to repair relations with corporate executives who have soured on
giving money to Republicans, and who have championed intensified
trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   The positive notices from Clinton's trip have already affected
Republican legislative strategy. The Senate was expected to vote
next week on a package of amendments sponsored by Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., that among other things would deny travel visas
to Chinese officials involved in forced-abortion policies and
prohibit new U.S.-backed international loans to China. But today,
Senate officials said the vote had been put off by at least a week,
partly out of concern that the amendments might not win a positive
reception in the afterglow of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat reaction even led White House officials to take the
unusual step of touting an editorial Tuesday in The Wall Street
Journal, whose editorial page is better known for harsh rebukes of
the president. White House communications director Ann Lewis said
she was so stunned by the unexpected praise that ``I looked again _
it did not say April 1,'' April Fool's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial declared: ``So we may break convention among the
president's critics by saying we think Clinton has been doing well
in China.'' (The Journal backed off in an editorial Friday,
accusing Clinton of ``kowtowing'' to China over Taiwan.)
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, and Democrats, do not expect the relative
silence on Clinton and China to last. Several Republicans said that
will depend in part on what polls show about the public reaction to
the trip. And some Republicans may be more willing to speak out
against Clinton after his arrival in Washington _ he is due back
early Saturday morning _ out of a tradition that it is
inappropriate to denounce a president while he is overseas.
</P>
<P>
   While most polling organizations are waiting until the end of
the trip to question Americans about whether it was a success,
surveys beforehand showed wide public support for the president's
trip. A New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted in early June found
that about half of Republicans and two-thirds of Democrats thought
Clinton should go to China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the International
Relations Committee, said it was too early to know how the trip
would play politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to talk to the Chinese people without any
restrictions and focusing on the rights of individuals was a
plus,'' he said. ``The key question is how much else was
accomplished? The Chinese achieved a number of important goals at
our expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson said he
believes that eventually Republicans can score political points.
``It will take time for the splash of the trip and the media
coverage to wear off and for the real substance of what went on to
surface,'' he said. ``As that happens and people begin to see the
way he gave away the store, they're not going to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Nicholson said he was deeply concerned about
China's missiles pointed at the United States, the President's
comments about Taiwan's reunification with China, the fund raising
scandals and Clinton's failure to meet with dissidents. ``It was
all carrot and no stick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like many other Republicans, Nicholson's language was
tamer than before the trip, when he said the president ``will walk
on the blood of those brave pro-democracy protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Romer countered that Clinton's performance exceeded his
expectations. He had been particularly concerned, he said, about
how the president would be perceived at the arrival ceremonies at
Tiananmen Square, site of the government's bloody crackdown in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how he would perform personally _ there was
tension with the Tiananmen Square thing,'' Romer said. ``I was
apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican media consultant Michael Murphy predicted that the
trip would provide nothing more than a short-term boost for
Clinton. ``It's not unlike the proverbial Chinese dinner:
short-term in its splendor,'' he said. ``It was a successful photo
op, which is what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that China has not become ``a gripping
national issue,'' Murphy added: ``This is an emotional issue for a
lot of us right wingers. We're just not big on freedom crushing,
democracy despising foreign dictators.''

ISRAELI EXCHANGE HOPES DOMESTIC COMPANIES KEEP ONE FOOT AT HOME  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JESSICA STEINBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Dual citizenship is one advantage that Israel
offers to keep immigrants coming. Now it is trying to use dual
citizenship to keep stocks from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, worried about a flight
of prominent Israeli high-technology stocks to the Nasdaq market in
the United States, are trying to entice them back. The exchange is
hoping that these companies will at least agree to list their
shares in both places.
</P>
<P>
   But the likelihood of a return home for most of these listings
is considered weak. The impediments range from a cumbersome Israeli
bureaucracy to a perception that Nasdaq is the pre-eminent market
for high-technology companies trying to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   In size alone, Nasdaq dwarfs the Tel Aviv exchange. The $266.4
billion market capitalization of Microsoft, perhaps the best-known
Nasdaq stock, is three times the size of the market capitalization
of all the listings on the Tel Aviv exchange.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Israeli companies are listed on Nasdaq, making it
the largest foreign source of new Nasdaq listings after Canada.
Only five of those companies are also listed on the Tel Aviv
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about Nasdaq are not obvious in The City, the
neighborhood that the 60-year-old Tel Aviv exchange calls home.
Visitors see tree-lined streets and outdoor cafes filled with young
Israeli brokers sipping coffee and speaking rapidly into cellular
phones, a reflection of Israeli prosperity and technical advances
that contrasts sharply with the economy of years ago, when the
best-known exports were Jaffa oranges and Uzi submachine guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Tel Aviv exchange lists more than 650 companies, including
banks, insurers, chemical manufacturers and construction companies.
Ronit Harel, head of the exchange's listings department, said it
was hoping to make itself more like Nasdaq, and her optimism is
shared to some extent in Israeli brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will become in fashion to list in Israel,'' said Eli
Nachum, head of trading at Zannex Securities, a firm in Tel Aviv.
Nonetheless, he said, ``the fact that Israeli companies aren't
traded in both exchanges is a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Israeli high-technology executives, Nasdaq is preferable
because of its enormous liquidity. With far more money in the
market, it is easier for stocks to be bought and sold at a fair
price.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Israeli technology companies, whether they are
selling high-speed modems or Internet security software, are
exporting to the United States. More often than not, their
investors are Americans who are more willing than their Israeli
counterparts to place their faith and finances in risky ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli investors are a little scared of the high-tech
stocks,'' said Ron Levkovitz, co-general manager of Epsilon, a
private portfolio and fund management firm in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Levkovitz said 90 percent of the Israeli equity market was held
by local institutional investors, made up of pension funds and
other large trust funds that by law can invest only 15 percent of
their assets in stocks. Institutional investors in the United
States, by comparison, put more than 50 percent of their assets in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Israeli fund managers cannot buy more than 10
percent of their stocks outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Schwed, chief executive of Checkpoint Software, an Israeli
provider of security software, said he never thought about listing
in Tel Aviv. Checkpoint went public on Nasdaq in June 1996 at $14 a
share with a market capitalization of $450 million. The shares now
trade at $32, with an average volume of one million shares a day
and a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about prices,'' Levkovitz said. ``No one in Israel
will pay the kind of prices the high-techs are commanding in the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwed said that from his perspective, the Tel Aviv exchange was
not sophisticated, with insufficient trading volume and too little
analyst coverage. He also criticized what he called unwarranted
restrictions on market freedom imposed by the Israeli Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common criticism. David Arzi, chairman of Nice Systems,
a provider of telephone computer systems, lists on both exchanges.
But he said listing on the Tel Aviv exchange was akin to walking
down Jerusalem's Via Dolorosa, or Street of Sorrow, the winding
path that Jesus supposedly took from prison to his Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly reports must be filed with the Israeli securities
commission and sent to all shareholders before publication, and the
company's full prospectus must be rewritten in Hebrew. There are
also restrictions on employee stock options; if options are offered
to more than 35 employees, the company must publish a new
prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took four months to give stock options to 88 of our
people,'' Arzi said. ``In certain aspects, Israel is the last
Bolshevik country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli securities commission is re-examining its listing
requirements to help lure the Israeli companies back.
</P>
<P>
   Arzi's decision to list his company on the Tel Aviv exchange has
not been all bad. Indeed, Nice Systems' experience is one reason
that young Israeli companies might want to list their stock at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Nice first went public on the Tel Aviv exchange in December
1991. At the time, the company had $1 million in profits and needed
cash to reinvest in its products. Arzi said he chose Tel Aviv over
Nasdaq ``because it's easier when the lifesaver speaks your
language.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that was one of the company's smartest moves, partly
because the Israeli market did not punish Nice for low profits in
its early years. By the time Nice went public on Nasdaq in 1996,
shares were $10. They soon tripled in value.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Zivatofsky, a technology analyst for Goldman, Sachs in
Israel, said Nice's experience also showed the wisdom of listing on
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the
U.S. is more sophisticated and that U.S. investors are going to
move Israeli shares on Nasdaq,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nice is currently the most liquid of the dual-listed Israeli
shares _ 77 percent of its shares are held by U.S. shareholders.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Israel's largest pharmaceutical
company and one of the Tel Aviv exchange's blue-chip stocks, is 60
percent owned by American stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Suesskind, Teva's chief financial officer, said there was a
nationalistic reason for listing on the Tel Aviv exchange, ``just
like building a Teva plant up north when there's shelling from
Lebanon.'' However, Suesskind said, he will never leave Nasdaq, his
home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listing on Nasdaq has made all the difference for us,'' he
said. ``It's the difference between watering your company's crops
from a plane instead of a pitcher.'' &QL;

CLINTON TO TALK DEMOCRACY IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A year ago, when China dissolved Hong Kong's elected
legislature, ousted politicians borrowed a phrase from General
Douglas MacArthur, defiantly vowing from the balcony of the
colonial legislature: ``We shall return.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursdaythey did, thanks to a healthy victory in recent
elections, the first under Chinese rule here. But even with 60
percent of the May 24 popular vote, democrats won only a third of
the seats under a new electoral system that favors pro-Beijing
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with the help of the Hong Kong people, you have elected
us,'' declared a jubilant Democratic Party chairman Martin Lee,
promising to work for a better economy. But to those who say
livelihood issues matter more than political freedoms, Lee added in
Chinese: ``People should never think that democracy, prosperity,
and the economy are separate. They are not mutually exclusive; they
are mutually beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with Lee and other political and business leaders
Friday and over dinner with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa Thursday
night, President Clinton was expected to discuss the prospects for
speeding the pace of democracy in Hong Kong. Arriving at Hong
Kong's brand-new $20 billion airport Thursday, Clinton caps his
nine-day China trip in the territory ranked the world's freest
economy _ a far cry from the communist mainland that regained
control of Hong Kong last year, and where Clinton just spent a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while economic freedoms are not new to Hong Kong, democracy
did not exist for a century and a half of British rule. The
overwhelming vote in May for the democracy camp, however, seems to
show that Hong Kong people want more than economic liberty. For its
part, if China were to allow people here to set their own pace for
democracy, it would prove Beijing's sincerity in upholding ``one
country, two systems,'' and its greater openness to outside ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a powerful encouragement to Taiwan that
reunification with China and democratic freedoms could go hand in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, China and the Beijing-allied government here show
no signs of budging on the timetable for elections and gradual
democratization agreed upon with Britain under the 1990 Basic Law,
Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Suen, secretary for constitutional affairs, recently
compared democracy to red wine, saying it needed time to mature and
that Hong Kong was not ready.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Loh, chairwoman of the Citizens Party and one of the
politicians Clinton will meet Friday, said she found Suen's
comments insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that Hong Kong people are any less ready for
democracy than many countries that already have it,'' said Loh, who
won one of 20 directly elected seats in the new 60-person
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Basic Law, the number of directly elected seats will
increase in the next elections in two years from 20 to 24, and the
number of seats chosen by a pro-Beijing ``election committee'' will
fall from 10 to six. The number of ``functional constituency''
seats, elected by members of special interest and professional
groups, would remain at 30.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004 all election committee seats would be eliminated, and
the legislature would be evenly divided between directly elected
representatives and those chosen for special-interest seats. In
2007 it would be possible to eliminate the special-interest seats,
but any change would require approval of the chief executive and a
two-thirds vote in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, if Beijing doesn't want it, it'll never happen. So
don't assume we'll have full democracy by 2007,'' Democratic Party
leader Lee said in an interview. Lee is expected to have a
15-minute talk with the president Friday. The discussion will be
private, perhaps to avoid rubbing China's nose in Clinton's meeting
with its most famous nemesis in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Lau, founder of the Frontier political group, who will
also meet Clinton, will point out that she won more than 100,000
votes _ but will be seated alongside lawmakers chosen by as few as
30 people from special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Any change to speed direct elections for lawmakers and the chief
executive, however, would require a constitutional convention and
the approval of China's National People's Congress to amend Hong
Kong's Basic Law _ something Lau admits is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing holding us back is China's intransigence and the
selfishness of some businesspeople here who want positions to be
given to them on a plate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lau and Lee may be underestimating many of their colleagues
in the pro-China camp. Allen Lee, chairman of the pro-business
Liberal Party, said his party members would support fully direct
elections in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the biggest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong, will support direct elections by
2007, said Tsang Yok-sing, its chairman. ``And if there's a
consensus among Hong Kong people that we should speed it up, the
DAB will support that.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, such as David Chu, a lawmaker chosen by the
Beijing-vetted election committee, oppose speeding the process.
``Democracy takes time to develop. Look at America _ how many years
after the establishment of your country were women able to vote?''
Chu asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is running quite well, so there's no reason to make
dramatic changes, even if it's good for us...We're running like a
Rolex watch _ or maybe a Timex watch,'' he allowed with a laugh,
referring to the poor economy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the slow pace for direct elections is rooted in Chinese
as well as British fears that Hong Kong could become a base for
undermining the mainland, explained David Dodwell, co-author of
``The Hong Kong Advantage.'' Hong Kong has a long history as a
haven for opponents of mainland regimes _ dating back to Sun
Yat-sen's movement to overthrow the last emperor 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainland is still anxious...that Hong Kong not act as a
catalyst for political destabilization on the mainland,'' Dodwell
said. ``It will take time before they realize that higher levels of
free speech don't necessarily challenge their authority. Clinton's
being in China is a drip on a stone, and democratization in Hong
Kong is another.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Cheng, host of the popular radio call-in show ``Teacup in
a Tempest,'' said that while Hong Kong may not have a democratic
government, it does have ``a democratic community. We are stil able
to talk and do whatever we want. People criticize openly the local
government...Nonetheless, we need one-man, one-vote for the Chief
Executive and one-man, one-vote for the Legislature. That's the
only way you could qualify Hong Kong as a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   At an official dinner Thursday night, Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa assured Clinton that Hong Kong will ``gradually evolve our
political structure, with universal suffrage our ultimate
objective.'' But he cautioned that progress would follow ``the
timetable laid down by the Basic Law and what is in the best
interest of the people of Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton exchanged warm toasts with Tung and was treated to a
gala reception by colorfully costumed lion dancers at the new
airport. But his arrival was not without drama. A case of 50
bullets was found floating in the harbor near a building where he
is expected to speak Friday. And later, if he needed any proof that
free speech remains intact, a dozen people burned an American flag
to protest the Washington's supposedly weak stand on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the freedoms go only so far; a law passed after the handover
bans the desecration of Hong Kong's or China's flag.

FAUX CACTUS IS LATEST TWIST FOR CELL-PHONE TOWERS

 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Atop a hill overlooking the Carefree Highway north
of Phoenix is a three-armed saguaro cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Monolithic and unusually straight, it stands out from other
saguaros that are neither as tall nor green. And for good reason.
Mother Nature had no hand in crafting this one.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's the work of wireless phone company US West and a
Tucson, Ariz., company that has made a variety of faux features,
including the artificial rocks for a posh Phoenician resort in
Phoenix and the FAO Schwarz Trojan horse at Caesar's Palace in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those cosmetic features, Larson's latest man-made project
is a actually a sheath over a monopole, commonly known as a
cellular phone tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves, `How do you create an icon or something
that allows Air Touch or US West to build out their system?' In
this case, a saguaro made a lot of sense,'' said Harold Schifman,
president of The Larson Co., which is owned by DMB, a real
investment firm based in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phone providers are getting more creative in hiding
towers in everyday objects. The Larson Co. has hidden monopoles in
pine trees, palm trees, church steeples, even in artificial bricks
on the side of buildings, such as America West Arena and a
Scottsdale coffee house.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the first saguaro that doubles as a cellular tower
as far as anyone can tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first one we've done,'' said Rex Engebretson,
regional real estate manager for US West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was concern that we do something of a stealth nature
because the site is unique in terms of elevation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The faux saguaro sits on state land overlooking the freeway. US
West needed about 65 feet to get a two-mile radius coverage area.
The elevation of the site meant the cactus could be about 30 feet
and still cover the required area.
</P>
<P>
   The need to hide towers is driven by growth in their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 55,600 antenna sites dot the country, about half
what's needed to build out each carrier's system, according to the
Cellular Telephone Industry Association in Washington, D.C. The
trade group does not break down the sites by state or county.
</P>
<P>
   CTIA spokesman Tim Ayers said he had not heard of any stealth
saguaros anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's cool,'' he said. ``I've heard of pine trees and palm
trees, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, wants the convenience of using a cellular
phone. Few like the ugly towers required to make that technically
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Larson Co. came up with the concept of a faux saguaro about
two years ago, Vice President Scott Krezner said. It began working
on prototypes soon afterward. Construction took about two months.
</P>
<P>
   The stealth saguaro is about 30 feet tall and 20 inches in
diameter. It's made of fiberglass, which is transparent to radio
waves. It cost $30,000 to $40,000 to build, Krezner said.
</P>
<P>
   That's considerably more than an unobstructed monopole.
</P>
<P>
   But US West's Engebretson said the cost was necessary to
complete the buildout of the company's network in the Phoenix area.
US West has about 180 sites in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stealthlike nature, the faux saguaro is surrounded
by two big metal boxes. One provides power and the other is a meter
for electricity usage.
</P>
<P>
   The tree also sits on a slab of cement and has three large black
cables running from its base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antennaes have to be on a stable platform,'' Engebretson
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits local governments from denying
applications by wireless service providers to build towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do anything but say no,'' the CTIA's Ayers said.
``They can say here not there, yellow not green.''
</P>
<P>
   Most wireless providers willingly comply with local governments'
stipulations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies want to come in as customer friendly,'' he said.
``They're not coming in to make enemies.'' &QL;

CLINTON SEES IDYLLIC SIDE OF CHINA

<P>
   YUCUN, China _ He towered a foot over virtually every villager.
The hamlet's only store did its accounting with an abacus. And one
of the village elders, 88 year-old Qu Zhenxin, said she never heard
of this man, this president, but was certainly pleased to welcome
him to town.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he wanted to show America the many faces
of China. Thursday, he fled the shimmering skyscrapers of Shanghai
for the tranquil Li River, where he arrived by boat to this tiny
farming and fishing village of some 500 people tucked amid the
storybook limestone hills of Guilin.
</P>
<P>
   They have no telephones here, no power equipment, no overt will
to be anything different than precisely what they are. The
villagers who met Clinton on the sun-baked dirt of their
schoolhouse playground carried with them a sense of China's rural
history and an innate sense of pride. They stood in the doorways of
their ancient houses beckoning this oversized American to join them
for a piece of fresh fruit and a photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this,'' Clinton said. ``You learn a lot about the
country from places like this. There is a larger percentage of
Chinese people in places like this than in the big cities, which is
hard to imagine when you think of how many people live in places
like Beijing and Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every resident of the village, accessible by an hour's
boat ride up the Li River or a two-mile walk across a dirt path to
the nearest road, has the family name of Zhao, and most are
obviously related to each other in ties that outstrip memory. A
member of one family said the house has been in his family name for
500 years.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by an entourage that seemed to dwarf the village
itself, Clinton walked up a crooked stone and dirt path into the
village of clustered brick houses with terra cotta roofs set in the
shadows of soaring rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   The houses have hard stone floors, spare furnishings, and photos
of Mao or Chinese military officials of the past hanging on the
walls. Their ceilings typically soared 20 feet or more, and the
upstairs loft areas were reached by ladders. While most residents
proudly pointed at their cable television hookups, there were no
telephones in the village.

   At the first house, Clinton sat awkwardly inside with his wife
and daughter against a wall as the extended Zhao family stood
staring at them in silence. One offered them fruit from a bowl
filled with bananas and grapes and what they said were green plums,
but the guests declined. Finally, Clinton asked who were the people
in the the photographs on the wall. More Zhaos, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many households live here?'' Hillary Clinton asked. Three,
she was told, all Zhao brothers and their families. As she talked,
a young boy came over and stood in front of Chelsea, and they
smiled at each other. When the Clintons got up to leave, the entire
family stood and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton soon arrived at what is known as the biogas facility, a
place where the villagers take all their human waste, put it
together in a large pot and bake it to what one local called ``a
nice brew.'' Once cooked, the waste emits a gas that the villagers
use to power their stoves and lights in a low cost fuel source that
seemed to provide the president with a unique sense of delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of rural places all over the world that should
be doing this with biogas,'' Clinton said, walking away from the
facility. ``This is one of the things that almost any village could
be doing. It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Guilin, Clinton Thursday urged China to learn from the
United States' mistakes and not harm the environment for the sake
of economic growth. He pledged US support to clean up the rivers,
air and land in China, which has five of the most polluted cities
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us, Chinese and Americans, preserve what we have inherited
from the past and, in doing so, preserve the future we are working
so hard to build for our children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Guilin's environmental leaders during a roundtable
discussion, Clinton said it is not too late for all of China to
reverse environmental trends that have put the country on track to
overtake the United States as the number one emitter of greenhouse
gases within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived at the town's one tiny store, he
immediately began telling the shopkeeper about his own grandfather,
who ran a store in Arkansas. Within a few minutes, Clinton was
standing inside posing by a glass case with the entire family.
Everyone was smiling. Afterward, Clinton saw their version of a
cash register. ``Look at this,'' he called out. ``An abacus for the
store, for counting.'' He pushed some of the beads around and said,
``This one still works pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the schoolyard, he shook hands along a ropeline with the
remaining townspeople as if he were running for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if every American could see what I've seen they would
be impressed, and I think they would want to work with China to
fulfill it's potential and the potential of its people,'' Clinton
said. ``They would want every Chinese life to have the chance to
flower.''

VACCINE MADE TO PREVENT AIDS BRINGS DISEASE, DEATH, RESEARCHER
SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The hope for a vaccine made of a live, weakened form of
the AIDS virus dimmed Thursday when a Harvard researcher reported
tests with a similar virus caused disease and death in monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Six of nine rhesus monkeys inoculated with the weakened form of
the simian immunodeficiency virus as infants have developed the
equivalent of full-blown AIDS since being vaccinated five years
ago, Dr. Ruth Ruprecht, associate professor at Harvard University
Medical School, said at the 12th World AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the monkeys have died and the others have early forms of
SIV infection but have not yet progressed to full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Four of 15 adult monkeys inoculated with the weakened virus show
increasing levels of SIV in the blood, and one has died of
infection and AIDS, Ruprecht said.
</P>
<P>
   Still another is showing serious immune system disorder and the
other two have indications of changes in their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was weakened, partially by deletion of two important
genes, Ruprecht said. That should have made it less likely to cause
disease and reduced its ability to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   But the virus continued to reproduce itself in the adults and
infants, she said. The size of the gene deletions got bigger and
bigger, and ``by the end of three to five years, we had a different
beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a weakened form of a virus is an accepted practice in
medicine. The oral Sabin polio vaccine was a weakened form of the
poliovirus. Infants who received it developed strong protection
against polio, and they often passed the weakened virus on to
others.
</P>
<P>
   In some rare instances, however, children acquired polio from
the weakened virus. That's the disaster Ruprecht wants to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, answering a call from the International
Association of Physicians in AIDS Care, more than 300 doctors who
treat AIDS volunteered to test a weakened virus vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   If such a vaccine could be made safe, it would offer the best
hope for an effective vaccine to prevent infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus. Some physicians thought the vaccine cause
was being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Farthing, a Los Angeles physician who issued the
call, said he would have expected the newborn monkeys in the
experiment to become infected by the weakened virus because they
have immature immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even while arguing it is impossible to determine the safety of
an HIV vaccine by testing it in monkeys, Farthing said he would
take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe we should do the experiment. The worst thing
that would happen is that I would have to take anti-retroviral
therapy that I give to my patients.''
</P>
<P>
   He said if patients in the safety study of the vaccine became
ill, they could go on the three-drug cocktail, which should help
keep the virus at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Bernard Hirschel, a leader of the conference and
professor at the University of Geneva, said that after hearing
Ruprecht's data, ``I have my doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel was one of the vaccine volunteers, but now has second
thoughts because of safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   He said the maker of the vaccine being proposed for human
studies has a virus that it is even more weakened than that used by
Ruprecht.
</P>
<P>
   There is a point of diminishing returns, he said. With too much
attenuation, the vaccine will not cause the immune response needed
for protection. If it is not strong enough, the person gets the
disease instead of the protection, Hirschel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it is possible to make a vaccine that is both
attenuated and effective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel said if he were convinced it was safe, he would have no
problem with a few volunteer physicians testing the vaccine. ``But
if it is a barrel over Niagara Falls, I don't think many people are
going to want to go,'' Hirschel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruprecht said she does not think the idea of the attenuated
virus is dead. She wants to look at other ways to weaken HIV or SIV
to prevent it from reproducing easily.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Gallo, co-founder of HIV and director of the
Institute of Virology at the University of Maryland, said he agrees
with Ruprecht's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A retrovirus (such as the vaccine) is forever,'' Gallo said,
pointing out that all retroviruses cause disease, although it takes
30 years for some.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier statement, Gallo warned against putting all
research money into a vaccine because the need for treatment
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we had effective vaccines today, we would still have
30 million people infected,'' he said. ``We can't put all our eggs
in the preventive vaccine basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo cited new targets in the life cycle of the virus as
promising avenues of preventing HIV from entering a cell.
Chemokines, proteins that fight cellular invaders, can compete with
HIV for the doorways or receptors to cells. That might be a viable
way of fighting HIV infection, he said.

FRANK, PARTNER HELPED CHANGE IMAGE OF GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were pioneers in national politics, an openly
gay member of Congress and his male lover lobbying President
Clinton in the Oval Office, shaping public policy, and demanding
equal recognition for themselves and other homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 11 years, Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat, and his partner, Herb Moses, reigned as the
capital's most prominent and influential homosexual couple. Cheered
by some, vilified by others, they changed the way gays and lesbians
are treated in Congress, in Washington society, and in the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   But they recently went their separate ways, leaving advocates
for homosexual rights with no similar role models on Capitol Hill
and ending a pivotal transitional era in Frank's once-tumultuous
private life.
</P>
<P>
   With the Washington townhouse that Frank and Moses owned up for
sale Thursday, advocates for gay and lesbian rights rued the demise
of their relationship and praised their contributions to the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provided the definition for how elected couples can serve
a public life with dignity and authenticity,'' said Kerry Lobel,
executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
``They did it in ways nobody had done before, and they accepted
nothing less than other elected couples should accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, in a telephone interview, said the reason he and Moses
decided a few weeks ago to end their relationship ``isn't anybody's
business.'' Frank, 58, said he and Moses split amicably, even
calling each other's families ``to make sure we all understand we
will be still be friendly and stay in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most Frank would say about the cause of the split was
that ``recently things changed some.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses, 41, who moved out of their townhouse near Dupont Circle
and opened a pottery studio a couple of blocks away, did not return
phone messages. And no one answered the doorbell Thursday at the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who is looking for a new place to live after the
townhouse is sold, said he told Moses he would take ``custody of
annoying questions from reporters'' about the breakup. ``He's a
private citizen again,'' Frank said. ``He doesn't have to answer
them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Moses rarely shied from public discourse after he
hooked up with Frank in the summer of 1987. Rocked by allegations
stemming from his affair with Steven Gobie, a prostitute he
solicited, then hired as a personal aide, Frank ended decades of
private torment that summer by publicly acknowledging he was
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   The House later formally reprimanded Frank for his role in the
Gobie affair. But by pronouncing his homosexuality and forming a
relationship with Moses, then an economist in the Agriculture
Department, Frank said he embarked on a vital progression from the
closeted, lonely life he long endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship meant I was getting experiences that a lot of
people have, and that was useful,'' he said. ``Before this, there
was an incompleteness about my understanding of both the positive
sides of a relationship and the real stresses and strains.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the breakup, he said, ``It's an unhappy part of life's
experiences, but it's still something that is there. Ten years ago,
it would have been remote to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the gains he has made over the last decade will help
him in the next stage of his life. ``I regard the 10 years as a
very positive thing,'' he said. ``The breakup doesn't undo any of
the positive effects, and it doesn't mean I revert to the way I was
10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Moses often appeared inseparable during the decade,
turning up regularly at White House dinners, State of the Union
addresses, Fourth of July fireworks on the national mall. They
appeared on lists of top power couples in the capital. And Moses
became the first partner of an openly gay member of Congress to
receive spouse status, granting him special access privileges
throughout the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their last public appearances, Frank and Moses
attended a celebration in April of Israel's 50th anniversary as a
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also invoked his relationship with Moses often in House
debates as part of their equal-rights campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing it,'' Moses said in a Globe interview in 1995,
``because we want to acknowledge we have a life as a way of
humanizing the experience for others'' in homosexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Moses, who left an executive post at the Federal National
Mortgage Association to open his pottery studio, became
increasingly engaged in the political struggle during his
relationship with Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he began fund raising for Representative Loretta
Sanchez, a California Democrat, when she was trying to unseat
then-Representative Bob Dornan, a Republican, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moses launched the effort after Dornan, a virulent foe of
homosexual rights, blasted Moses on the House floor. ``I know I
speak for most members when I state that the only Moses we like to
hear about on this House floor is our Moses of Exodus, Moses the
lawgiver, Moses of the Ten Commandments,'' Dornan said. ``I am
beyond annoyance hearing on this floor about Herb Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobel said Moses and Frank, in all their political activities,
tried to improve the status of homosexual couples. ``They wanted
the same treatment people gave Bill and Hillary and Ron and
Nancy,'' Lobel said. ``And they did it with grace, just as they
will break up with grace.''

FAILURE OF AIDS VACCINE TEST IN MONKEYS SPURS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Amid signs that the search for an AIDS vaccine is
finally getting the attention it deserves, some scientists Thursday
criticized the safety of one vaccine type that proponents say
should be tested in humans soon.
</P>
<P>
   Monkeys injected with an experimental vaccine, which contains a
live but weakened version of the simian AIDS virus, have sickened
and died of immune-system damage in recent experiments conducted by
a Harvard Medical School scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The new information immediately touched off a sharp debate about
the risks of a human version of the live-virus vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly our data raise a red flag'' about the safety of such
``attenuated'' viruses as AIDS vaccines, even when scientists try
to disable them by removing several genes, Ruth Ruprecht of
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute told colleagues at the 12th World AIDS
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Farthing, a Los Angeles physician who last year
organized 300 doctors willing to be guinea pigs in a test of a
live-virus AIDS vaccine, said Ruprecht's monkey data did not
necessarily imply danger to human volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Live attenuated vaccines have a long and illustrious history.
It's the way the world eliminated the ancient scourge of smallpox,
and a live-virus version furnished the prototype polio vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of HIV vaccine are being studied, such as those
based on pieces of the virus's coat or genetically engineered
canary pox viruses containing HIV genes. But scientists have no
idea yet whether those models will either be safe or protect
against HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in a live-virus AIDS vaccine stems in part from tests
on a simian version developed by Ronald Desrosiers of the New
England Regional Primate Center in Southborough, Mass. That vaccine
protected macaque monkeys against infection by the simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a close cousin of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Desrosiers's experiment convinced many AIDS researchers that a
live attenuated virus would make the best vaccine, if it could be
proven safe.
</P>
<P>
   Also lending impetus to the idea was an intriguing report from
Australia that a handful of people infected through blood
transfusions with a genetically deficient form of HIV have remained
well for 14 years, as has the blood donor. It would be ideal if a
vaccine could mimic this ``natural experiment,'' many reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruprecht reported Thursday that four out of 15 rhesus
monkeys vaccinated with a supposedly disabled SIV have had rising
levels of the virus in their blood _ the opposite of what
vaccination is supposed to do. One monkey has died of simian AIDS,
another is in early stages of the disease, and two more show signs
of immune system damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston researcher found in 1995 that the same vaccine caused
what she terms a ``fast-forward'' version of AIDS in infant
monkeys. Of nine young animals, six developed AIDS, five of the six
died, and the other three are in earlier stages of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, even a weakened SIV vaccine can mutate into
disease-causing forms, Ruprecht said. Unlike polio and other
viruses, SIV and HIV insert themselves into the genes of their
host's cells. Other viruses introduced through vaccines ``are no
longer around to cause trouble'' after they stimulate a lasting
immune reaction, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruprecht's findings were clearly a setback for proponents of
human tests of live attenuated HIV vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Farthing, who leads the physician group pushing for human tests,
said Ruprecht's findings are ``concerning'' but not directly
relevant to the proposed tests of a human version of the monkey
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   He said the HIV used in a human test would lack four or more
genes, while the monkey virus Ruprecht tested was missing three
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Ruprecht's finding immediately undermined some support for a
live attenuated vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of this week's conference, which has attracted more
than 12,000 AIDS researchers to Geneva from all over the globe,
indicated Thursday he would withdraw as a volunteer for the trial
of a live attenuated HIV vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my doubts now,'' said Dr. Bernard Hirschel of Geneva's
University Hospital, who had signed up with Farthing's group. ``At
first I thought it was a good idea because there has been an
exaggeration of the dangers of live attenuated vaccines. But if you
listen to Ruth Ruprecht, you get a new perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   During a sharp exchange Thursday, Dr. Robert Gallo of the
University of Maryland criticized Farthing for assuming a vaccine
based on live HIV would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take years beyond your lifetime'' to be able to
conclude that such a vaccine would be safe, Gallo told Farthing,
``and it would take a lot of people.''

FLIERS LIKELY TO GET BUMPED MORE OFTEN

<P>
   (Undated) - Wanna earn some extra money on your summer vacation?
</P>
<P>
   No lawn mowing or lemonade stands involved.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is pack plenty of snacks and magazines, get
to the airport early and volunteer to be bumped from your flight.
</P>
<P>
   If the airline needs your seat, you'll get a free ticket or
voucher, often worth more than you paid for the ticket. America
West Airlines, for example, was offering $500 passes last week for
an overbooked Phoenix-to-San Francisco flight that goes for as low
as $150 round-trip with advance purchase. Ditto on a recent
Albuquerque-to-Phoenix flight that goes for as low as $78
round-trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's not cash, but it could take care of that trip home for the
holidays or an upcoming business trip. All for a little flexibility
and patience.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines ask for volunteers when a flight is overbooked, and
that happens frequently in the peak summer travel period as throngs
of vacationers join business travelers in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the season,'' said Tom Parsons, a travel bargain guru
who publishes ``Best Fares,'' a magazine and Web site
(www.bestfares.com) focusing on travel deals. ``Most of the major
airlines are going to be bumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons thinks there could be a bumper crop of bumping this
summer because airlines are filling a record number of seats as the
travel boom continues.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Harry, owner of Travel Etc. in Tempe, Ariz., has seen it.
She flew to San Diego and back recently on two overpacked flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were buying them off going, and they were buying them off
coming,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A host of factors can lead to an overbooked flight. First,
history can prove the airline wrong. Carriers, hoping to fly a
flight as full as possible, typically sell more seats than
available based on previous no-show levels. Sometimes, those
no-shows show up.
</P>
<P>
   Add in weather woes, mechanical problems and canceled flights _
on your airline or another with a lot of service in the area _ and
you're looking at a classic imbalance of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a little more than 1 million passengers volunteered
to be bumped by one of the 10 major U.S. airlines, according to the
U.S. Department of Transportation. An additional 54,000 were
involuntarily bumped. The figures are out of a total of 503 million
passengers boarded.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West was tops in volunteer bumping, with 31
per 10,000 passengers. Southwest used the fewest volunteers (12.9
per 10,000) but it involuntarily bumped more (2.16 per 10,000) than
everyone but Alaska Airlines. America West forced 1.98 passengers
per 10,000 from their seats.
</P>
<P>
   America West's prolific bumping is great news for Phoenix
travelers, since it is the busiest carrier at Sky Harbor
International with 206 daily departures.
</P>
<P>
   Walk through the airline's concourses in Terminal 4, and you're
bound to see this message scroll across the electronic message
board at each gate: ``This flight may be overbooked. Please ask
about our Silverliner passes.''
</P>
<P>
   It caught Kelli Henson's attention this week.
</P>
<P>
   Henson and her boyfriend, Tom Hill, both from Houston, were on
their way to Orange County for a Tall Clubs International
Convention. (He's 6-foot-4; she's 5-foot-10). Their 10:24 a.m.
connecting flight out of Phoenix was oversold, and the gate agent
was offering $400 vouchers to potential volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that's good for another trip later in the year,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't in in a big hurry _ ``as long as we're there for
happy hour,'' Henson said with a laugh _ so they put their names on
the volunteer list.
</P>
<P>
   So did Carole Haworth, an Amway distributor on her way home from
a business trip to Detroit. She figured the voucher, which was
worth twice what she paid for the entire trip, could be used for a
future business trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expenses for travel are out of my pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, America West didn't need any volunteers on
that flight, and the three boarded the plane as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent fliers tend to be the most savvy bumpees, said Harry,
who's also president of the Arizona chapter of the American Society
of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   They pick flights they know are frequently overbooked to
increase their chances for free travel. At the gate, they ask for
two $200 vouchers instead of one $400 voucher so they can go on two
trips, even if it means adding a little extra money to go to say,
Chicago. With a $400 voucher, at least on America West, you only
get one trip, regardless of the fare. If the flight costs $238, for
example, you wouldn't get the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the know also know not to jump at the airline's first
offer, unless they think it's the best deal out there and is plenty
for an upcoming trip. Airlines often up the ante if they're not
getting enough volunteers. On a recent Phoenix-to-St. Louis flight
on America West, for example, the gate agent started at $300 per
passenger and upped it to $400 about five minutes later, one
passenger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to auction,'' Harry said. ``It's absolutely amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The compensation varies, and is again based on supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't get their seven people off the plane for this
price, they will up it,'' Harry said.
</P>
<P>
   America West offers a maximum of $600, according to spokeswoman
Patty Nowack. Southwest starts at $100 over the face value of the
ticket and goes up from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do what we need to get the flight off and accommodate those
people we couldn't get on board the plane,'' spokeswoman Linda
Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a flight looks very overbooked, the airlines
look for volunteers in advance.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, US Airways called Harry's agency and offered a
family of five $500 a piece in vouchers to give up their seats on a
flight to the East Coast. They had paid less than $400 for the
tickets. They jumped at it, and used the vouchers for a Christmas
trip they otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking $2,500,'' Harry said, and all they gave up was
one day of their two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, America West called one of Harry's clients to
see if she would give up her seat on a Las Vegas-to-Flagstaff
flight in exchange for a seat in first-class on a later flight. She
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are negatives to getting bumped. Your luggage
goes ahead of you, for example. And there's no guarantee your
self-imposed delay won't be longer than planned. Although the
airline guarantees you a seat on one of its later flights or a
competitor's flight, there's no guarantee that plane will leave on
time.
</P>
<P>
   A Phoenix business traveler who accepted America West's $500
voucher to get off his San Francisco flight last week ended up
spending the entire morning at Sky Harbor because the flight they
put him on was delayed.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to your schedule and penchant for travel.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons volunteers to get bumped every chance he gets. Last week
he gave up his first-class seat on a 7 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight
from San Francisco to Dallas. In return, he received a free
first-class round-trip ticket _ not a voucher _ and a seat on the
noon flight.
</P>
<P>
   The noon flight also was overbooked, but he passed on being
bumped from that flight because the next non-stop flight (which he
prefers) was about 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like sitting around until midnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has paid off. Parsons is flying free to New York today
for an interview on ``Good Morning America.'' The fare for such a
last-minute trip in first-class: $2,026.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a godsend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for getting bumped
</P>
<P>
   - Try to find out in advance whether the flight is overbooked.
Your travel agent can check the seating situation in the computer,
or you can call the airline. If the travel agent says there are no
seats left to be assigned or the airline says the seats are under
``airport control,'' it's a good sign the flight is overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   - Arrive at the airport approximately 90 minutes before
departure time. It pays to be at the gate even before the flight
opens so you can be first in line. Sometimes airlines need just one
volunteer to give up a seat.
</P>
<P>
   - Ask if the flight is oversold and whether volunteers will be
needed. Ask what the compensation will be. If it sounds good, sign
up.
</P>
<P>
   - Ask the agent what flight on which you will be guaranteed a
seat. If you can't be guaranteed a seat on the next flight out, ask
the agent to protect you under Rule 240 (they know what it is) with
a guaranteed seat on another carrier's flight.
</P>
<P>
   - Carry the airline's flight schedule so you know your options.
</P>
<P>
   - If you are bumped and have more than a two-hour wait, ask for
all the extras: a free long-distance call (or five-minute calling
card), a meal ticket, free admission to the airport club and free
drink and headset coupons for the flight. Be courteous. &QL;

SKILES' KIND OF TOWN?  
 SUNS ASSISTANT COACH WILL TALK TO CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Chicago Bulls have asked the Suns for permission
to talk with assistant coach Scott Skiles about the Bulls' head
coaching position, league and Suns sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, contacted Wednesday in Indiana, declined to comment
about the Bulls or other teams that have contacted him this summer,
and he said he's not in any hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer, next summer, I'm not tied up into a time (to
become a head coach) or anything,'' he said. ``I'm just going
through it like everyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Keith Glass, would neither confirm nor deny that
Skiles has been contacted by the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put this in boldface with quotes _ No comment,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Suns officials also declined to comment. General Manager Bryan
Colangelo would only say that the club told Skiles when he was
hired that it would not stand in the way of his getting a head
coaching job if the opportunity arises.
</P>
<P>
   A Bulls spokeswoman said Wednesday that Chicago General Manager
Jerry Krause will not comment on prospective coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said Skiles is among five or six candidates the
Bulls plan to contact or have contacted about the job. Others
rumored to be under consideration are Iowa State's Tim Floyd and
Kansas' Roy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, along with Indiana's Rick Carlisle and Cleveland's
Sidney Lowe, is considered one of the up-and-coming head coaching
prospects among NBA assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, who guided Chicago to six NBA championships in the
1990s, has announced that he will not return as Bulls coach.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Jackson's departure, the Bulls job could be the most
desirable in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Or the next coach could face a complete rebuilding job.
</P>
<P>
   League Most Valuable Player Michael Jordan is contemplating
whether to return, retire or play for another team.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan back, the Bulls will be a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial All-Star Scottie Pippen is a free agent who has
indicated that he probably will not be back. Dennis Rodman also is
a free agent, along with center Luc Longley and three-point
specialist Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   If all return, the Bulls likely will be the team to beat again.
If they all leave, the Bulls will be in a rebuilding mode.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls aren't the only club interested in Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   Glass confirmed that the Los Angeles Clippers and Denver Nuggets
have inquired about the Phoenix assistant, who spent 10 years in
the NBA as a point guard and still holds the league record for
assists in a single game (30). He joined the Suns last season and
was Coach Danny Ainge's lead assistant.
</P>
<P>
   But Skiles, 34, was considered a hot property in coaching
circles even before that.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Suns, he served as head coach of PAOK, a
Greek professional club. He took over that team during midseason
with the club foundering and led it to the European Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been contacted directly and indirectly by some teams,''
Glass said. ``They expressed interest in various forms. I'm just
excited for him. People know what he's about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a great coach in the league. If it doesn't happen
this year, it will happen next year.'' &QL;

FAILURE OF AIDS VACCINE TEST IN MONKEYS SPURS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Amid signs that the search for an AIDS vaccine is
finally getting the attention it deserves, some scientists Thursday
criticized the safety of one vaccine type that proponents say
should be tested in humans soon.
</P>
<P>
   Monkeys injected with an experimental vaccine, which contains a
live but weakened version of the simian AIDS virus, have sickened
and died of immune-system damage in recent experiments conducted by
a Harvard Medical School scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The new information immediately touched off a sharp debate about
the risks of a human version of the live-virus vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly our data raise a red flag'' about the safety of such
``attenuated'' viruses as AIDS vaccines, even when scientists try
to disable them by removing several genes, Ruth Ruprecht of
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute told colleagues at the 12th World AIDS
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Farthing, a Los Angeles physician who last year
organized 300 doctors willing to be guinea pigs in a test of a
live-virus AIDS vaccine, said Ruprecht's monkey data did not
necessarily imply danger to human volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Live attenuated vaccines have a long and illustrious history.
It's the way the world eliminated the ancient scourge of smallpox,
and a live-virus version furnished the prototype polio vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of HIV vaccine are being studied, such as those
based on pieces of the virus's coat or genetically engineered
canary pox viruses containing HIV genes. But scientists have no
idea yet whether those models will either be safe or protect
against HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in a live-virus AIDS vaccine stems in part from tests
on a simian version developed by Ronald Desrosiers of the New
England Regional Primate Center in Southborough, Mass. That vaccine
protected macaque monkeys against infection by the simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a close cousin of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Desrosiers's experiment convinced many AIDS researchers that a
live attenuated virus would make the best vaccine, if it could be
proven safe.
</P>
<P>
   Also lending impetus to the idea was an intriguing report from
Australia that a handful of people infected through blood
transfusions with a genetically deficient form of HIV have remained
well for 14 years, as has the blood donor. It would be ideal if a
vaccine could mimic this ``natural experiment,'' many reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruprecht reported Thursday that four out of 15 rhesus
monkeys vaccinated with a supposedly disabled SIV have had rising
levels of the virus in their blood _ the opposite of what
vaccination is supposed to do. One monkey has died of simian AIDS,
another is in early stages of the disease, and two more show signs

WIDOW WITH CLAIM TO $21   MILLION LOTTERY TICKET TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ During eight gruelling hours on the witness stand
Thursday, widow Paraskeve Kantges insisted she never canceled a
winning $21 million lottery bet, as a Watertown variety store owner
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never _ I am certain,'' Kantges said under questioning by her
attorney, James Merberg.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges, testifying before a state Lottery Commission hearing in
Brantree, said she telephoned the winning Mass Millions bet to
Coolidge Provisions Feb 5. But store owner Nick Havan claims she
called back later and canceled the bet, so he kept the winning
ticket for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Former Massachusetts Lottery executive director Samuel M.
DePhillippo ruled in favor of Kangtes, but Havan appealed. Retired
Superior Court Judge Robert
</P>
<P>
   Steadman is hearing evidence and will make a recommendation to
the full
</P>
<P>
   lottery commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since the hearing began Monday, Havan's witnesses have testified
that Kantges, a frequent lottery player, is obstreperous and fickle
about her bets. One witness, James G. McGoldrick Jr., testified
that Kantges told him she didn't win the $21 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand Thursday, Kantges refuted that testimony. ``I was
not going to talk to him or anyone else about my personal affairs _
especially about money,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges identified records showing she has played the same
number, based on her birth date, for years. She also reiterated her
side of the story _ that she called in 96 lottery bets to Havan
about 4 p.m. the day of the drawing, but got only 95 tickets the
next morning, with the winning ticket missing.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges said she called Coolidge Provisions on Feb. 6 and told
clerk Hrach ``Richie'' Abrahamian that she won the jackpot. ``He
said, `You didn't have it,' and hung up the phone. I thought he was
playing a joke,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a cab to the store, Kantges testified, Abrahamian
tossed a batch of 95 tickets at her. When she realized the winning
ticket was gone, she confronted Havan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I gave the ticket to Richie. He must have ... given
it to someone else.''' Kantges said. ``I felt like the legs had
been cut out from under me.''

FLIERS LIKELY TO GET BUMPED MORE OFTEN

   (Undated) - Wanna earn some extra money on your summer vacation?
</P>
<P>
   No lawn mowing or lemonade stands involved.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is pack plenty of snacks and magazines, get
to the airport early and volunteer to be bumped from your flight.
</P>
<P>
   If the airline needs your seat, you'll get a free ticket or
voucher, often worth more than you paid for the ticket. America
West Airlines, for example, was offering $500 passes last week for
an overbooked Phoenix-to-San Francisco flight that goes for as low
as $150 round-trip with advance purchase. Ditto on a recent
Albuquerque-to-Phoenix flight that goes for as low as $78
round-trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's not cash, but it could take care of that trip home for the
holidays or an upcoming business trip. All for a little flexibility
and patience.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines ask for volunteers when a flight is overbooked, and
that happens frequently in the peak summer travel period as throngs
of vacationers join business travelers in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the season,'' said Tom Parsons, a travel bargain guru
who publishes ``Best Fares,'' a magazine and Web site
(www.bestfares.com) focusing on travel deals. ``Most of the major
airlines are going to be bumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons thinks there could be a bumper crop of bumping this
summer because airlines are filling a record number of seats as the
travel boom continues.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Harry, owner of Travel Etc. in Tempe, Ariz., has seen it.
She flew to San Diego and back recently on two overpacked flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were buying them off going, and they were buying them off
coming,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A host of factors can lead to an overbooked flight. First,
history can prove the airline wrong. Carriers, hoping to fly a
flight as full as possible, typically sell more seats than
available based on previous no-show levels. Sometimes, those
no-shows show up.
</P>
<P>
   Add in weather woes, mechanical problems and canceled flights _
on your airline or another with a lot of service in the area _ and
you're looking at a classic imbalance of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a little more than 1 million passengers volunteered
to be bumped by one of the 10 major U.S. airlines, according to the
U.S. Department of Transportation. An additional 54,000 were
involuntarily bumped. The figures are out of a total of 503 million
passengers boarded.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West was tops in volunteer bumping, with 31
per 10,000 passengers. Southwest used the fewest volunteers (12.9
per 10,000) but it involuntarily bumped more (2.16 per 10,000) than
everyone but Alaska Airlines. America West forced 1.98 passengers
per 10,000 from their seats.
</P>
<P>
   America West's prolific bumping is great news for Phoenix
travelers, since it is the busiest carrier at Sky Harbor
International with 206 daily departures.
</P>
<P>
   Walk through the airline's concourses in Terminal 4, and you're
bound to see this message scroll across the electronic message
board at each gate: ``This flight may be overbooked. Please ask
about our Silverliner passes.''
</P>
<P>
   It caught Kelli Henson's attention this week.
</P>
<P>
   Henson and her boyfriend, Tom Hill, both from Houston, were on
their way to Orange County for a Tall Clubs International
Convention. (He's 6-foot-4; she's 5-foot-10). Their 10:24 a.m.
connecting flight out of Phoenix was oversold, and the gate agent
was offering $400 vouchers to potential volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that's good for another trip later in the year,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't in in a big hurry _ ``as long as we're there for
happy hour,'' Henson said with a laugh _ so they put their names on
the volunteer list.
</P>
<P>
   So did Carole Haworth, an Amway distributor on her way home from
a business trip to Detroit. She figured the voucher, which was
worth twice what she paid for the entire trip, could be used for a
future business trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expenses for travel are out of my pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, America West didn't need any volunteers on
that flight, and the three boarded the plane as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent fliers tend to be the most savvy bumpees, said Harry,
who's also president of the Arizona chapter of the American Society
of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   They pick flights they know are frequently overbooked to
increase their chances for free travel. At the gate, they ask for
two $200 vouchers instead of one $400 voucher so they can go on two
trips, even if it means adding a little extra money to go to say,
Chicago. With a $400 voucher, at least on America West, you only
get one trip, regardless of the fare. If the flight costs $238, for
example, you wouldn't get the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the know also know not to jump at the airline's first
offer, unless they think it's the best deal out there and is plenty
for an upcoming trip. Airlines often up the ante if they're not
getting enough volunteers. On a recent Phoenix-to-St. Louis flight
on America West, for example, the gate agent started at $300 per
passenger and upped it to $400 about five minutes later, one
passenger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to auction,'' Harry said. ``It's absolutely amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The compensation varies, and is again based on supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't get their seven people off the plane for this
price, they will up it,'' Harry said.
</P>
<P>
   America West offers a maximum of $600, according to spokeswoman
Patty Nowack. Southwest starts at $100 over the face value of the
ticket and goes up from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do what we need to get the flight off and accommodate those
people we couldn't get on board the plane,'' spokeswoman Linda
Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a flight looks very overbooked, the airlines
look for volunteers in advance.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, US Airways called Harry's agency and offered a
family of five $500 a piece in vouchers to give up their seats on a
flight to the East Coast. They had paid less than $400 for the
tickets. They jumped at it, and used the vouchers for a Christmas
trip they otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking $2,500,'' Harry said, and all they gave up was
one day of their two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, America West called one of Harry's clients to
see if she would give up her seat on a Las Vegas-to-Flagstaff
flight in exchange for a seat in first-class on a later flight. She
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are negatives to getting bumped. Your luggage
goes ahead of you, for example. And there's no guarantee your
self-imposed delay won't be longer than planned. Although the
airline guarantees you a seat on one of its later flights or a
competitor's flight, there's no guarantee that plane will leave on
time.
</P>
<P>
   A Phoenix business traveler who accepted America West's $500
voucher to get off his San Francisco flight last week ended up
spending the entire morning at Sky Harbor because the flight they
put him on was delayed.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to your schedule and penchant for travel.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons volunteers to get bumped every chance he gets. Last week
he gave up his first-class seat on a 7 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight
from San Francisco to Dallas. In return, he received a free
first-class round-trip ticket _ not a voucher _ and a seat on the
noon flight.
</P>
<P>
   The noon flight also was overbooked, but he passed on being
bumped from that flight because the next non-stop flight (which he
prefers) was about 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like sitting around until midnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has paid off. Parsons is flying free to New York today
for an interview on ``Good Morning America.'' The fare for such a
last-minute trip in first-class: $2,026.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a godsend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for getting bumped
</P>
<P>
   - Try to find out in advance whether the flight is overbooked.
Your travel agent can check the seating situation in the computer,
or you can call the airline. If the travel agent says there are no
seats left to be assigned or the airline says the seats are under
``airport control,'' it's a good sign the flight is overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   - Arrive at the airport approximately 90 minutes before
departure time. It pays to be at the gate even before the flight
opens so you can be first in line. Sometimes airlines need just one
volunteer to give up a seat.
</P>
<P>
   - Ask if the flight is oversold and whether volunteers will be
needed. Ask what the compensation will be. If it sounds good, sign
up.
</P>
<P>
   - Ask the agent what flight on which you will be guaranteed a
seat. If you can't be guaranteed a seat on the next flight out, ask
the agent to protect you under Rule 240 (they know what it is) with
a guaranteed seat on another carrier's flight.
</P>
<P>
   - Carry the airline's flight schedule so you know your options.
</P>
<P>
   - If you are bumped and have more than a two-hour wait, ask for
all the extras: a free long-distance call (or five-minute calling
card), a meal ticket, free admission to the airport club and free
drink and headset coupons for the flight. Be courteous. &QL;

FRANK, PARTNER HELPED CHANGE IMAGE OF GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were pioneers in national politics, an openly
gay member of Congress and his male lover lobbying President
Clinton in the Oval Office, shaping public policy, and demanding
equal recognition for themselves and other homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 11 years, Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat, and his partner, Herb Moses, reigned as the
capital's most prominent and influential homosexual couple. Cheered
by some, vilified by others, they changed the way gays and lesbians
are treated in Congress, in Washington society, and in the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   But they recently went their separate ways, leaving advocates
for homosexual rights with no similar role models on Capitol Hill
and ending a pivotal transitional era in Frank's once-tumultuous
private life.
</P>
<P>
   With the Washington townhouse that Frank and Moses owned up for
sale Thursday, advocates for gay and lesbian rights rued the demise
of their relationship and praised their contributions to the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provided the definition for how elected couples can serve
a public life with dignity and authenticity,'' said Kerry Lobel,
executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
``They did it in ways nobody had done before, and they accepted
nothing less than other elected couples should accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, in a telephone interview, said the reason he and Moses
decided a few weeks ago to end their relationship ``isn't anybody's
business.'' Frank, 58, said he and Moses split amicably, even
calling each other's families ``to make sure we all understand we
will be still be friendly and stay in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most Frank would say about the cause of the split was
that ``recently things changed some.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses, 41, who moved out of their townhouse near Dupont Circle
and opened a pottery studio a couple of blocks away, did not return
phone messages. And no one answered the doorbell Thursday at the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who is looking for a new place to live after the
townhouse is sold, said he told Moses he would take ``custody of
annoying questions from reporters'' about the breakup. ``He's a
private citizen again,'' Frank said. ``He doesn't have to answer
them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Moses rarely shied from public discourse after he
hooked up with Frank in the summer of 1987. Rocked by allegations
stemming from his affair with Steven Gobie, a prostitute he
solicited, then hired as a personal aide, Frank ended decades of
private torment that summer by publicly acknowledging he was
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   The House later formally reprimanded Frank for his role in the
Gobie affair. But by pronouncing his homosexuality and forming a
relationship with Moses, then an economist in the Agriculture
Department, Frank said he embarked on a vital progression from the
closeted, lonely life he long endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship meant I was getting experiences that a lot of
people have, and that was useful,'' he said. ``Before this, there
was an incompleteness about my understanding of both the positive
sides of a relationship and the real stresses and strains.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the breakup, he said, ``It's an unhappy part of life's
experiences, but it's still something that is there. Ten years ago,
it would have been remote to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the gains he has made over the last decade will help
him in the next stage of his life. ``I regard the 10 years as a
very positive thing,'' he said. ``The breakup doesn't undo any of
the positive effects, and it doesn't mean I revert to the way I was
10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Moses often appeared inseparable during the decade,
turning up regularly at White House dinners, State of the Union
addresses, Fourth of July fireworks on the national mall. They
appeared on lists of top power couples in the capital. And Moses
became the first partner of an openly gay member of Congress to
receive spouse status, granting him special access privileges
throughout the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their last public appearances, Frank and Moses
attended a celebration in April of Israel's 50th anniversary as a
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also invoked his relationship with Moses often in House
debates as part of their equal-rights campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing it,'' Moses said in a Globe interview in 1995,
``because we want to acknowledge we have a life as a way of
humanizing the experience for others'' in homosexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Moses, who left an executive post at the Federal National
Mortgage Association to open his pottery studio, became
increasingly engaged in the political struggle during his
relationship with Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he began fund raising for Representative Loretta
Sanchez, a California Democrat, when she was trying to unseat
then-Representative Bob Dornan, a Republican, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moses launched the effort after Dornan, a virulent foe of
homosexual rights, blasted Moses on the House floor. ``I know I
speak for most members when I state that the only Moses we like to
hear about on this House floor is our Moses of Exodus, Moses the
lawgiver, Moses of the Ten Commandments,'' Dornan said. ``I am
beyond annoyance hearing on this floor about Herb Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobel said Moses and Frank, in all their political activities,
tried to improve the status of homosexual couples. ``They wanted
the same treatment people gave Bill and Hillary and Ron and
Nancy,'' Lobel said. ``And they did it with grace, just as they
will break up with grace.''

RUSSIAN TAX COLLECTORS WIN SHOWDOWN WITH BIG OIL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's legendarily ineffectual tax men stared down
the nation's biggest and most powerful corporation Thursday,
threatening to seize control of the company _ and its executives'
dachas, yachts and other perks _ unless it paid billions of dollars
in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To most everyone's amazement, the company, Gazprom, gave in. By
the end of a day filled with bluster and rumor, Gazprom had agreed
to turn over 4.2 billion rubles ($675 million) in unpaid taxes by
Monday, and to start paying the government about 4 billion rubles a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Experts were left wondering whether President Boris Yeltsin had
grown a backbone in dealing with the oligarchs who control the
Russian economy _ or whether he had staged a deft act of political
theater.
</P>
<P>
   For the agreement, announced Thursday evening, does not merely
force Gazprom, the world's largest petroleum company and Russia's
biggest tax delinquent, to make good on its back taxes. It also
would require the government to pay Gazprom billions of rubles for
oil and gas that government agencies and state companies purchase
but never pay for.
</P>
<P>
   By many estimates, the two payments would amount to a wash. And
if that is true, the government's raid Thursday is unlikely to have
much impact on Russia's budget deficit, the core of its economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a see-saw day as far as Gazprom's fortunes
are concerned,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil expert and
co-director of research for the United Financial Group in Moscow.
``But if this is all that happened, it doesn't seem to justify the
farce that took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the government's crackdown offers great symbolic
benefits. For one, it signals that politically influential
companies will no longer escape the taxes they have ignored since
Russia ended Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The action is also likely to impress the International Monetary
Fund, which is negotiating a multibillion-dollar loan that Russia
is seeking. The IMF has demanded that Russia improve its tax system
as a condition for further loans.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside: if the government genuinely has decided to
get tough on Gazprom, the company may have to get tough on its
non-paying customers. Gazprom is owed 100 billion rubles ($11.6
billion), and its customers are so strapped that more than half the
debts are settled through barter. Dunning them could send a
political and economic shudder through the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many businesses which operate completely
unprofitably,'' said James Henderson, an oil and gas analyst for
MFK Renaissance, a Moscow investment firm. ``They survive because
Gazprom doesn't turn off their power. The simplest method to deal
with them is to turn off the light.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events bore the mark of the tough-minded new director
of the state tax service, Boris Fyodorov.
</P>
<P>
   If Fyodorov's revenue men were seeking a symbolic target, they
could hardly have chosen a better one. Gazprom _ the name is short
for Gas Industry _ is ubiquitous in Russia, and in business and
politics the $25 billion company is a force of nature.
</P>
<P>
   From a 34-story skyscraper surrounded by gardens and tennis
courts, its leaders direct a workforce of 370,000, control a third
of the world's known gas reserves and supply 25 percent of Western
Europe's natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought one-third of a major Russian television
network, NTV, in 1996 and wielded its investment unashamedly to
promote Yeltsin's successful run for a second term as president. By
Russian standards, that is not surprising: the government owns 40
percent of Gazprom; five of its 11 directors are government
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it surprising that Yeltsin chose a former head of
Gazprom, Victor Chernomyrdin, as prime minister after his
re-election. During Chernomyrdin's tenure, Gazprom struck a deal to
pay about 2.5 billion rubles of its monthly 4-billion ruble tax
bill, with additional payments pegged to the company's ability to
collect the money owed it.
</P>
<P>
   But things clearly have changed since Sergei Kiriyenko, himself
a reformer, replaced Chernomyrdin this spring and hired Fyodorov as
chief tax collector.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the rationale for the raid was that the company had
paid only a billion rubles of its June tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's events seemed more intended to generate a wave of
publicity _ and at that, they succeeded. Word began circulating
Wednesday that the government planned drastic action against the
company. How drastic became clear Thursday, when the state tax
service released a list of assets it pledged to seize.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides ``ruble and currency accounts of debtors,'' the list
included ``planes, yachts, boats, cabins, swimming pools, sports
facilities, countryside residences, reception mansions and other
luxury goods owned by Gazprom.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed Thursday night on his own NTV, Gazprom president Rem
Vyakhirev angrily called the crackdown ``a real circus
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that Moscow was making moves against Gazprom, that
the police were sent to our offices, money demanded and so on,'' he
said. ``Today in our reception rooms in Bogorodskoye, they arrived
in force: 5 plainclothesmen and 20 guys in masks, like Chechens who
came down from the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   While the threat to curtail executives' luxuries grabbed
headlines, the tax office's real weapon lay in the legal document
that entrusts the government with 40 percent of Gazprom's shares.
Citing a clause that makes tax payments a condition of the trust,
Kiriyenko said the government would dissolve the agreement and take
control of the Gazprom board if the company did not come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody must pay taxes,'' he said. ``The government will not
allow blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the
threat had been withdrawn. ``Despite the quite stormy nature of the
discussions, an agreement has been reached,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains unclear exactly what that agreement entails.
Gazprom claims that it owes the government 12 billion rubles ($2.6
billion) in taxes, but that the government owes it 13 billion
rubles in unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   A Finance Ministry official said Thursday night that the
government had not totaled its debts to Gazprom. A government
statement Thursday indicated that the two sides will convene a
committee to sort the matter out.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom's director, Viyakhirev, greeted the specter of more
negotiations with tax collectors with unalloyed sarcasm: ``We're
planning to clear several offices so that they can settle there on
a permanent basis.'' &QL;

THEY WASHED AWAY THE NEW WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The brassy Sass Class _ the brood with a 'tude _ was
supposed to take over Wimbledon, push the aged ladies in their
wheelchairs off the upper staircases at Centre Court and fight
among themselves to see who would be the adolescent queen, just in
case 17-year-old Martina Hingis couldn't handle it anymore. Where
are they now that those pensioners Jana Novotna and Nathalie
Tauziat have reclaimed the oldest tournament for, shall we say, the
maturest women?
</P>
<P>
   The New Wave got washed away, beached, and Saturday here are
Jana and Nathalie, seeded 3 and 16, in one of the least expected
finals ever, not exactly sending ``wish you were here'' postcards
to the kiddies they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, Anna Kournikova fell down short of the starting gate
and is nursing a sore thumb. The Williams Sisters, Venus and
Serena, guaranteeing that one of them would win, pulled up lame
with sore illusions. Mirjana Lucic and Patty Schnyder lost their
way in the second-round maze. And Hingis was mugged, 6-4, 6-4, the
crown toppling from her wise young head as Novotna fired a sizzling
serve, the last shot of an afternoon of chilling breezes and grimy
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Munchkins, go home!'' was the theme as Tauziat and Novotna,
lurching toward October birthdays _ a 31st for Nathalie, 30th for
Jana _ made it the ``Old Faces of '98 Revue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jana lit up the frowning sky with a sublimely aggressive
performance on the worn and fading carpet of grass, a tour de force
that ranks with the finest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Jana!'' resounded the shouts from across the dusky
green playroom, as though one voice representing the 13,120 Centre
Court witnesses. She had their eyes popping with soaring backhand
overheads, slithering slices that seemed hissing snakes at the
queen's feet, and volleying that made you think she could pluck
shooting stars.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses felt for her. They knew she'd made a choky,
charitable donation of the championship to Steffi Graf five finals
ago, and hadn't been able to hold a 2-0 third-set lead against
Hingis in last year's title bout. Her clock was running, though not
as fast as she.
</P>
<P>
   Few have played as spectacularly in the game's prime showroom.
Novotna had to because plucky little Hingis countered fiercely,
feeling very possessive about her crown, won as the greenest champ
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   You could have named your price with any London bookmaker if you
were hallucinating about Tauziat going all the way. Never better
than a quarterfinalist in 42 previous major starts, she looked
worse than her age at the beginning of a 1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 surge
past Natasha Zvereva _ just like Novotna. Old bones. Creaky starts.
Flat tires on the wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat was once a child herself, the women's champion of no
less than the mammoth Central African Republic at 14 _ ``well, only
a few people played.'' She grew up there, the daughter of a French
plumbing supplies salesman.
</P>
<P>
   As the longest shot of all female finalists here, Nathalie was
flirting with some history: the lone Frenchwoman since Francoise
Durr in 1970 to make the semis, and with a chance to be the first
Gallic finalist since _ whew! _ the incomparable Suzanne Lenglen,
champ of 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon, the house that the magnetic Lenglen built, could be
Tauziat's. Until she came along in 1919, never to be beaten, the
original ground with 4,500 seats was big enough. The English mobbed
the joint to see her, inspiring construction of the ``new''
(present) layout in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Durr, an onlooker left over from 1970, and hoping to be
surpassed by her friend, Tauziat, groaned, ``How can she get out of
this grave?'' as Nathalie lost the first set faster than you can
say Billie Jean Moffitt King, the woman who beat Francoise that
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed,'' says Tauziat. ``I was out there with my
big chance of my life and letting me _ everybody _ down. I said to
myself, `Don't let this happen. Fight.''' Lashing out angrily, she
launched an attack. Serving and volleying she caught up and brought
down Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back from the dead,'' Durr wept happily.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Graf and Monica Seles, No. 22 Zvereva appeared a
Cinderella in progress, poised to be the only unseeded finalist in
the female annals. Tauziat turned her into a pumpkin. ``I am so
happy,'' smiles she, who came to town with a 13-11 record. ``Not on
the moon yet ... but almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna looked like the moon had fallen on her at the 6-minute
mark. She lost the first 9 points, the first three games, and was
in a crater at 0-40 in the fourth game. Shedding four break points,
Jana was on a moonshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Novotna says, ``there are many wonderful new players,
but experience is very important.'' This is her apparently lucky
13th Wimbledon. No doubt the Children's Crusade will regroup, but
there is something to say for age and experience. It is Novotna.

CLINTON URGES CHINA TO FOLLOW HONG KONG'S LEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Story will update around 10:45 p.m., CDT) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Clinton, the first U.S. head of state to
visit this former British colony, called Thursday for the
territory's democracy to be a beacon to the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton raised the
touchy issue in a meeting with Tung Chee-hwa, the leader imposed on
Hong Kong after the territory was handed over to China a year ago
this week.
</P>
<P>
   To press the issue of political freedom, Clinton planned to meet
Friday with the leading anti-Beijing democrat in the Hong Kong
legislature, who has called on the United States to press China
more on human and political rights.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry called democracy ``an element of (Hong Kong's) future
and its past which is so vital'' and ``provides kind of an
inspiration for what could be the long-term future for the rest of
the People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention political reform in remarks at a dinner
hosted by Tung.
</P>
<P>
   Tung told the dinner that Hong Kong ``will gradually evolve our
political structure, with universal suffrage our ultimate
objective.'' But he offered no assessment on when or whether
multi-party democracy might spread to the remainder of China.
</P>
<P>
   Tung stressed that the ``one country, two systems'' policy that
allows limited democracy in Hong Kong was ``working and working
well.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday to community leaders at the Hong Kong
Convention Center, Clinton planned to sum up his nine-day trip to
China with remarks that also looked more broadly at the question of
Asian stability in the 21st century. It was topical not only
because of Hong Kong's role as a financial center but also because
the city, once considered fiscally unshakable, has been roiled by
the Asian financial crisis and is technically in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Tung said Hong Kong's economy has been ``severely damaged by
this turmoil.'' But survival as a financial center is ensured, he
said, because of spirit, tradition, prudent management, sound
banking and a ``huge foreign exchange reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung called for the United States to continue its leadership
position in combating the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there is no one in America who is not eagerly
awaiting the resumption of real growth and stability in the Asian
economy, and we are prepared to do whatever we can to support it,''
Clinton responded before exchanging toasts with Tung at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This present financial crisis, too, will pass if we work
together with discipline and vision to lift the fortunes of our
neighbors,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived the day following the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's reversion to Chinese rule, after more than a 150 years as
Britain's principal toehold in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Since reverting to Chinese rule, Hong Kong has been governed as
a ``special administrative region'' under the ``one China, two
systems'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Hong Kong is not without its anti-Beijing dissidents, and
Clinton planned a 20-minute private meeting Friday with Martin Lee,
head of the local Democratic Party. Lee, a longtime member of the
old colonial legislature, was recently returned to the Legislative
Council in the first election after the hand-over.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of the council is elected by all Hong Kong
voters, with the remainder coming from professions and other
political groupings. Under the ``basic law,'' as the new Hong Kong
constitution is called, that proportion would increase to half by
2008, but Lee has called for the entire body and the chief
executive to face popular election much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said that although the Clinton
administration supports the timetable in the basic law, it would
not object to a quicker move to a fully democratic government in
Hong Kong. McCurry said Clinton intended to raise the prospect with
Tung.
</P>
<P>
   Following an afternoon news conference and a ride on one of the
famous Hong Kong Harbor ferries, Clinton was to depart for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively smooth hand-over is one reason the White House
has felt comfortable in continuing its eager engagement with
China's leaders. Had Beijing decided to crack the whip in the
former colony, U.S. opposition to Clinton's quest for a ``strategic
partnership'' with China would have been even more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One, Clinton's blue and white 747, touched down at
Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong's new international airport, after a
65-minute flight from Guilin, where the president had spent the day
admiring the famous limestone mountains from a boat on the Li River
and consulting with Chinese environmental advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first visiting foreign leader to use the new
streamlined airport, which opens next week. It replaces Kai Tak,
the in-town field known for its harrowing landing approach between
high-rise apartment buildings. Chinese President Jiang Zemin
dedicated the airport earlier Thursday and then took off for
Beijing from the new field.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hand-over, American presidents avoided Hong Kong, a
convenient Asian refueling spot and beguiling rest stop, because of
its colonial status and touchy geopolitical ramifications. Some
vice presidents and secretaries of state were less circumspect and
would dip into the city's luxurious hotels and restaurants for a
breather in the midst of a grueling Asian fly-around.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Hong Kong poll timed for the anniversary found
Hong Kong residents less confident of the future than they were a
year ago. In the survey, 48.6 percent of respondents said their
confidence had dropped since the hand-over, compared to 18.8
percent who held that view just after the British governor departed
last July.

ONCE-QUIET BRITISH COUNTRY ROADS INUNDATED BY WOMEN IN SEARCH OF

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BRINGTON, England _ If there were any dissenters here who
found it all a bit much _ the rush of cars on once-quiet country
roads, the $15 commemorative pillboxes, the fresh expressions of
grief that made it seem almost as if Diana, the Princess of Wales,
died last week instead of last August _ they were mostly keeping
quiet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk to you, and I don't want to give my
opinion,'' said one woman, answering the door at her cottage not
far from the gates of Althorp, Diana's childhood home. She did
agree to sell a jar of homemade honey, though, for $2.50. ``You
should have seen the crowds yesterday. One person was very rude.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were bound, of course, for Althorp, where Diana's
brother, Earl Spencer, opened a $5 million shrine (and a cafe and
gift shop) to her memory on Tuesday. Until the end of August,
members of the public who have paid $16 apiece and ordered their
tickets in advance will be allowed to tour the earl's new Diana
museum, which rehearses in vivid, sobering detail the now-familiar
stages of her brief life. (If you haven't bought a ticket already,
too bad: they're already sold out for the summer.)
</P>
<P>
   There is an exhibit devoted to Diana's childhood, with grainy
black-and-white home movies of Diana at a tea party, Diana on a
swing, Diana on her tricycle. There is an exhibit that shows her as
the devoted mother of two sons, one the heir to the throne of
England. Her larger-than-life wedding dress, all poofy silk and
satin frills, is on display here, as are a selection of other
outfits. There is also a Christmas card from Prince Charles, a toy
rabbit with an ear missing, and some of the books of condolence
signed by members of the public when she died. And, at an outdoor
clearing, pilgrims can sit quietly and look out across the lake at
the small island that holds Diana's grave.
</P>
<P>
   People who saw the exhibit Thursday pronounced it moving and
surprisingly untacky. ``It's very tasteful and very esthetic,''
said Steven Phillips, an importer and exporter of English and
American collectibles from Dallas, who said he was shifting his
professional attention away from his previous interest _
discontinued, or ``retired,'' Beanie Babies _ into Diana
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Most people seemed to approve of the earl and all his works. But
here in what has become the epicenter of the Diana grief industry,
there were tiny hints of discord. One couple said they were shocked
to see that the hundreds of bouquets and notes left on Tuesday by
the first crowd of visitors had apparently been dumped in a bin
that looked uncomfortably like a huge trash receptacle.
</P>
<P>
   And Lindy Jamieson said she was shocked, period. ``I'm
embarrassed to be here,'' said Ms. Jamieson, a secretary who had
come, she said, only because a friend had begged for her company
and given her a free ticket. ``I know Earl Spencer keeps saying,
`Fancy making money out of her death,' but of course he's done it
to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a serious gender divide seemed to be developing in
and around the Althorp parking lot, a muddy field with space for
hundreds of cars and the early gathering point for visitors. By far
the biggest number of the visitors were women, old and young, in
groups of two, three and four. The relatively few men accompanying
them seemed to be drastically less fervent about the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only came to prevent a big fight,'' said Brent Abbott, a
U.S. Air Force production superintendent stationed in Germany, who
pronounced the post-Diana phenomenon ``a woman thing'' that was
experienced not by him but by his wife, Belinda.
</P>
<P>
   How could he explain it? ``I guess because she's such a strong
woman and women look up to her,'' he said, looking guiltily at Mrs.
Abbott, who through sheer force of will had herded not just her
husband but their two children out of their base in Germany and
brought them all the way to Althorp. ``Is that a good guess?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outside the post office, Wilf Daniels, a 68-year-old resident of
Chelmsford, tried to account for his own presence in the heart of
Diana country. ``My wife's more ... '' he began. ``When you think
of it, really, women followed Diana when she was alive, and most
men are much more interested in their own wives than in other
women. What I want to know is why all these roads around here are
blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Walton, a service engineer from West Yorkshire, was
carrying a $120 Althorp trinket box bought by his wife, Samantha.
Mrs. Walton, he said, cried when she saw Diana's grave, but he most
certainly did not. ``Look, I was the chauffeur,'' he said. ``I came
to see the house and grounds. They had a lovely staircase made of
oak.''
</P>
<P>
   If many men were having a hard time dealing with all these
feelings, how was Great Brington itself coping? It was hard to
tell. Many of the residents of the village, once a farming
community that is now inhabited mostly by professionals, were at
work. Others treated reporters like so many spawns of the Devil,
rushing into their houses and pulling their curtains across the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin Whiley, the village postmaster, who has emerged as a
cheery neighborhood spokesman and who is enjoying a rich trade in
special-edition Diana stamps and Princess of Wales postcards, said
that Great Brington had moved past its earlier fears about the
Diana-seeking crowds.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, with several roads around the village now closed,
most people were parking in the designated Althorp parking lot
rather than on Great Brington's streets, he said. Nobody seemed to
be wandering around looking for a public bathroom, perhaps the
village's greatest fear (it doesn't have public bathrooms). And _
softened, perhaps, by Earl Spencer's gracious one-time-only gesture
in waiving the Althorp entrance fee for hundreds of his neighbors
last week _ the residents generally feel positive toward him,
Whiley said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the earl owns about 30 percent of Great Brington,
including the post office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people feel strongly about Diana, and some don't really
care,'' said Whiley, who counts himself among those that do feel
strongly. ``But there it is. We're here, and we have to put up with
it.'' &QL;

   Journalists' judgement jeopardize credibility of profession
</P>
<P>
   By Lyle V. Harrisc. 1998 Cox News Service ATLANTA -- From the
Monica Lewinsky investigation to CNN's report on Tailwind, 1998 has
been a year of high profile apologies, corrections, and retractions
for the working press. Here are just a few of them:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 27: The Dallas Morning News is forced to retract a story
based on accounts from a Washington lawyer suggesting that a Secret
Service agent had seen the president and Monica Lewinsky in a
``compromising situation'' inside the White House. The source later
claimed information for the report was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 9: The Wall Street Journal published a story on its website
and in its early print editions claiming that White House steward
Bayani Nelvis told the grand jury he observed Lewinsky and the
president and Lewinsky in a study outside the Oval Office. After
Nelvis' lawyer attacked the story, the Journal ran a correction
explaining that he had made the statement to Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   May 11: The New Republic Magazine fires associate editor Stephen
Glass for making up major parts of a story about a 15-year-old
computer hacker. Glass also acknowledges ``embellishements'' in
other stories he had written for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   June 20: Boston Globe columnist Patrcia Smith apologizes to
readers after admitting that she had frabicated characters and
quotes in her work. She is forced to resign, and return an award
for distinguished writing from the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.
</P>
<P>
   June 28: The Cincinnati Enquirer issues a front page apology,
and agrees to pay Chiquita Brands International $10 million for a
series of stories on the company's s business practices. Lead
reporter Mike Gallagher is fired for allegedly stealing voice mail
tapes and failing to disclose that fact to his editors.

 &HT;    Media reaction to CNN's retraction mixed By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Reaction within the media to CNN's Tailwind
retraction is double-edged: CNN did the right thing, after a
terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case of bad journalism followed by responsible
action,'' says Paul McMasters, first amendment ombudsman at the
Freedom Forum Media Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) there's a heightened concern all around relating to
questions of media credibility,'' he adds. ``The message has been
received loud and clear that the public wants to be told when the
media messes up. I believe confession is not only good for the
soul, but good for credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The press should do more of this: when they make mistakes, own
up to them,'' says Tom Rosensteil, director of the Project for
Excellence in Journalism. ``I think it establishes something about
the character of an organization. The way it deals with screwups
says as much about its character as its triumphs.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say that CNN's quick action in retracting the story
shouldn't diminish the enormity of the mistake and the problems
that led to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a failure from the top down of the organization _ a
failure of reporting, editing, producing and oversight,'' says
Robert Lichter, director of Center for Media and Public Affairs in
Washington. ``It's more troubling than a columnist making something
up. This was a major story that they put resources behind and
intended to make their mark with. It turned out to be a black
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment in which the Tailwind story was born makes it
more troubling than the string of other recent media
transgressions, some media observers say. The story debuted on the
first installment of ``NewsStand,'' a TV newsmagazine designed to
boost CNN's prime time ratings by combining the forces of Time
Warner's CNN and such Time Warner magazines as Time, Fortune and
Entertainment Weekly .
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have commented for years about what the
competitive forces have done to create an environment where these
kinds of mistakes are made,'' says Michael Kramer, editorial
director of Steven Brill's Content, a new magazine about the media.
``In this case, you could say it's one of the downsides of synergy.
They wanted to make a big splash. There was a sense of
breathlessness to it (CNN's Tailwind story) that's partially driven
to make this kind of splash and boost ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN is on a campaign with Rick Kaplan (the CNN president who
spearheaded 'NewStand') to increase ratings,'' says Marvin Kalb,
director of the Shorenstein Press Center at Harvard University.
``Kaplan is an extremely able producer, but this is going to be a
setback. Rick and other producers work in a climate of such
ferocious competition and bottom-line imperatives that it is not
public service now that is the highest requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But that competition can't be used as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is intense, but that does not give the green
light to shortchange accuracy or integrity,'' says Bernard Kalb,
former network correspondent who hosts CNN's ``Reliable Sources,''
a weekly show that examines media issues, including those that
involve CNN. ``No matter how bloodthirsty the competition is, you
cannot surrender the integrity of the reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers see CNN's quick resolution to the Tailwind
story's controversy as good for the network in the short term. But
the longterm affects are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is people forget all the good reporting you've
done when you have a terrible mess like this _ it's going to take
CNN a long time to recover the credibility it justly built up in
the past,'' says McMasters. ``Long term, if CNN upholds the
standards of the past, they can put it behind them. NBC's
'Dateline' (and its discredited truck explosion report) survived
and thrived, and CNN can do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects on CNN will be minimal,'' counters Kramer. ``They
would be far greater if the story were continuing over time and
(CNN was) seen as recalitrant in addressing it. It's clear that
anytime you come out and admit an error you're in better shape in
the long run than if you sweep it under the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real effect, some say, has to be internal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (people at CNN) are some terrifically talented people and
I suspect they will learn from this,'' says Rosensteil. ``If it
causes people at the top to be clearer about what values are
important, that can be valuable. If it causes them to lose
confidence and move into institutional housecleaning, people become
frightened about what they should and shouldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an atmosphere where there was a premium put on
getting the story than on getting it right, they better look deep
inside themselves.''

 By LEONARD M. APCAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After decades in which Cadillac represented the epitome of
American luxury cars, plans to sell its first truck this fall, a
sport utility vehicle akin to the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon.
Cadillac dealers are overjoyed. At last they will have something
for a hot part of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the other sizzling part of the market is the luxury
segment, though you might not be able to tell by hanging out in a
Cadillac showroom. Sales of luxury cars rose last year more than
sales of sport utilities, mini-vans and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Cadillac DeVille, though, were scarcely up from a year
earlier. It seems few people under 60 aspire to own one.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to this American icon underscores a marketing
adage: Great brands don't die; they kill themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When foreign competitors began to redefine luxury cars by
melding performance with the ride and handling of a sport sedan,
Cadillac dawdled. Then, after a few self-inflicted wounds _ the
chintzy Cimarron and the pricey Allante _ younger buyers avoided
Cadillac altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 20 years since Cadillac had a record sales year.
Back then, Lexus didn't exist and Mercedes-Benz and BMW were mere
blips. Lincoln, long the No. 2, added a luxury truck last year, the
Navigator, and is now outselling the General Motors nameplate.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac has offered both a restyled Seville and the smaller,
German-made Catera to lure sedan buyers from the foreigners. It has
even put a bigger engine in a DeVille, firmed the ride even more,
and crowned it the Concours. None of these have dramatically
revived the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's DeVille, a four-door, six-passenger, front-drive
cruiser is heir to the memorable beasts of a generation ago. The
problem with it is not that it handles or rides like the boats of
yore. It mercifully does not. The successful Northstar 4.6-liter V8
engine achieves its 300 foot-pounds of torque at surprisingly low
speeds. Here are 275 horses with 0 to 60 acceleration in less than
eight seconds. That is comparable to a BMW 740iL and a Jaguar XJ8,
which make the nearly $40,000 Cadillac look like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   (GM has suspended production of the DeVille because of the auto
workers' strike.)
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that you can toss this brute around. The
problem is that DeVille styling comes straight from Boston Whaler.
The bulging sides and swollen rear provide one of the biggest
trunks on the road, but also an oafish look that is painfully blind
to luxury styling today.
</P>
<P>
   At just over two tons, the DeVille could stand some treadmill
time. The Lincoln Town Car, which is longer and wider, weighs less
than a DeVille. The Cadillac's girth also makes you think the big
car is going to be difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   Inside there is so much empty space between the driver and the
door that when you first get behind the wheel you are certain you
will sway with every turn. But the improved suspension and handling
allowed a lot less bucking and swaying than I had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, however, is dated. It is quiet, and the generous
seats are sculptured and comfortable for four people, roomy enough
for two more. Armrests sport cup holders and storage bins. Air bags
in the dash and the front doors tag all the essential bases.
</P>
<P>
   But imaginative touches are few. A fake veneer crosses the dash
and doors. A computer gives data about fuel economy, mileage, even
engine oil life. Leather upholstery, heated seats and lumbar
support are expensive extras.
</P>
<P>
   A separate temperature control for the front passenger is a
cheap plastic knob. Yet DeVille ranks with the Japanese and
Mercedes in many J.D. Power &AMP; Associates customer satisfaction
listings.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Cadillac updated the DeVille's boaty ride
and handling by giving them a firmer, more precise feel. This is
always a tricky balance: the softer and quieter the ride, the
mushier the handling. And the more precise the steering, the
rougher the ride. The body was made more rigid and the suspension
firmed up.
</P>
<P>
   What was offered in 1994 was a good compromise for a big
American car, but the design was a dud. The rear wheels were partly
hidden, the sides were bulky, and the car lacked panache.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the drawing boards, Cadillac stylists opened up the
rear-wheel wells and moved the wheels out a hair to make the 1997
car look less chubby. The 1998 retains that design. A major
restyling, probably a leaner, European look, is a year or so away.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac recently got a new, 40-something boss. He told the
styling department to design a 1990s version of the celebrated 1959
Cadillac, the one with big fins and huge V8 power. The stylists are
still at work. That is a good sign. Maybe this time they will come
up with something boomers want to buy.

SPORTS COLUMN: STAR SYSTEM IS DECLINING IN THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey philanthropist who envisions the Nets becoming
part of Newark's downtown revival apparently did his homework in
basketball economics. Ray Chambers, who helped broker the deal that
will very likely transfer the team to two real estate developers,
called around the sport's power circles and raised the question
that most owners haven't satisfactorily answered themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Of at least two sources, Chambers asked, among other things, why
Finn Wentworth and Stanley Gale of Florham Park, N.J., should plunk
down $150 million for control of the Nets and then face contract
negotiations with Keith Van Horn, Jayson Williams and Kerry Kittles
that would ultimately cost them more than the franchise is worth.
He was told that under the present system, the Nets will wind up
paying Van Horn a $100 million-plus jackpot that would probably
preclude them from keeping the other two players.
</P>
<P>
   Same story as in Minnesota, where ownership can afford Stephon
Marbury or Tom Gugliotta or possibly neither after shelling out
$126 million at boardroom gunpoint last summer for Kevin Garnett.
This entertaining young team is almost certain to die in its
infancy as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of having three stars are gone,'' one well-connected
agent said recently. ``It's two stars and then managing well enough
to surround them with the right role players.''
</P>
<P>
   This works out if those stars are Michael Jordan and Scottie
Pippen, John Stockton and Karl Malone. Most of the time, it looks
more like Chris Webber and Juwan Howard, teams that function more
like insipid monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan notwithstanding, the concept of the National
Basketball Association as a quality team sport is the reason to
root for David Stern and the owners in the latest round of labor
chess. Hope for them to somehow lower the ceiling on these $20
million-a-year stars, and not because the commissioner has virtue
on his side, but because the odds of building and maintaining a
cohesive team of diverse skill have become too high.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line that the players had better read is that the
product not only costs too much for the paying fan, it also too
often stinks.
</P>
<P>
   The old-school union thinking, espoused long ago by the late
Larry Fleisher, is that only the superstars, with their rising
salaries, can set the table for everyone else. Not in this market,
though. Now a couple of players, often leveraging only their
potential, gorge themselves and leave behind only minimum-salary
scraps and bones. At last count, there were 150 players making the
minimum. It is almost comical when the union claims it is fighting
for basketball's ``middle class'' at the same time it refuses to
discuss a system that would restore a modicum of sanity to the
top-tier salary.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing is the association's president, and that helps
explain it. For 10 years, Ewing thought collective bargaining meant
him, David Falk and someone from the Knicks. Three summers ago,
Falk the agent informed Ewing and Jordan that the union was about
to cut a deal that would imperil the superstar windfall. Ewing
became an instant activist, and he helped save a system that
produced a cool $66 million for him last summer.
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing demonstrates sympathy for less fortunate teammates, I
will take him more seriously as the representative of all players.
Meanwhile, reporters seeking a few complimentary parting words on
Charles Oakley last week were hung up on. I ran into Ewing at a
dinner in Washington last Friday, asked about Oakley and was
promptly shooed away. Six days after the trade, Ewing finally
addressed the subject, but only at his own news conference to
unveil a painting. What a piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing complained that no other industry limits salaries, which
is news to postal workers, but there is nothing to prevent him and
Jordan from selling themselves as prime-time programming to CBS,
Disney or Fox. If the $20 million-a-year basketball star makes
dollars and sense, you can bet Uncle Rupert or some other
television network will pay it.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball has always been a star and ego-driven sport, but the
NBA marketeers went too far in exploiting this theme while
expanding and diluting their league, and now the system has
degenerated too much for the players to stop believing in the
parables spun in their behalf. They don't recognize the cyclical
nature of entertainment and sports. Reebok didn't fire Shaquille
O'Neal this week because he doesn't make free throws. People are
tiring of the rap and the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Two stars in basketball is no better a review than it is in the
movies.

 By SUSAN J. WELLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Lehl takes pride in his attendance record at work: not a
single unscheduled day off in 6 of his 12 years as a maintenance
mechanic for Continental Airlines at Hobby Airport in Houston. But
it was the phone call he received back in January that really made
his effort seem worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from Continental chief executive Gordon Bethune and
president Gregory Brenneman. And the news was that the company was
giving Lehl a $40,000 Ford Explorer _ the Eddie Bauer Limited
Edition model _ to reward him for his devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't hardly believe it, but I knew it sounded like
them,'' Lehl recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of eight winners drawn in Continental's twice-a-year
raffle for employees, at the manager level and below, who have not
missed a day of work during a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great incentive,'' said Lehl, 49. ``It creates
excitement among all of us, and people really strive to come to
work and achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance programs on the scale of Continental's remain
uncommon, but they are among the many tools that companies are
devising in the seemingly endless battle against costly unplanned
absences.
</P>
<P>
   Since Continental, which has 40,000 employees, began its
perfect-attendance program in 1996, it has given away 30 sport
utility vehicles valued, together, at $1.2 million, including sales
tax, title and license fees and gift taxes, all of which the
airline pays for the lucky winners. The payoff is clear, according
to company spokesperson Julie Gardner. The absence rate has been
reduced ``tremendously,'' she said, though she declined to give
specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers are also improving attendance by becoming more
realistic about the demands on their workers, according to Paul
Gibson, an executive editor at CCH Inc., a publishing and research
firm in Riverwoods, Ill., that surveys employers on absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are starting to accept that their employees miss work,
Gibson said, ``not just because of sickness, but because of the
employee's need for personal time to handle everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence rate is going down,'' he added, ``as companies
increasingly become savvy to and aware of the results that can be
had by giving employees more control over their time.''
</P>
<P>
   That can represent a big shift in corporate thinking and in
policies addressing time off, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   While some employees abuse traditional sick-leave policies, he
said, most don't. Instead, many employees end up with many unused
sick days at the end of the year. And so companies are turning away
from traditional sick-leave policies and toward more flexible
alternatives, like time-off banks that let employees use their days
off as needed for illness, personal days and vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional sick-leave policies are just out of step with the
times,'' Gibson said. Last year, when CCH surveyed 451 U.S.
companies employing a total of 750,000 workers, only 9 percent of
the 130 employers who had improved their control of absenteeism
attributed the change to effective traditional sick-leave programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategies appear to be working. According to the CCH
survey, unscheduled absences as a percentage of paid productive
time were 2.32 percent last year, down from 2.77 percent the
previous year. The 1997 rate was the lowest since the survey was
first conducted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which polled human resources professionals in eight
industries, found that the annual per-employee cost of absences had
also declined, to $572 in 1997 from $603 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Government data confirm the trend. The average annual absence
rate among all American full-time wage and salary workers was 3.9
percent in 1997, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, down
from 5.1 percent in 1989, the first year such data were collected.
The government defines absences as instances when full-time workers
put in fewer than 35 hours during a week because of illness,
injury, child-care problems, family or personal obligations, civic
or military duty, or maternity or paternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of punishment certainly figures in the improved attendance
rates, and many employers say they see a strengthening work ethic,
Gibson said. But he puts greater stock in the new employer
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Fannie Mae, the government-chartered mortgage
finance company, based in Washington. Two months ago, it expanded
its already extensive benefits package after studying why existing
benefits were underused by its 3,700 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the innovations is a phase-back-to-work option that allows
new parents to return gradually after childbirth or an adoption
leave. The plan lets new parents work three days a week for four
months after either 12 weeks of paid maternity leave or four weeks
of paid paternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae also increased its time-off allowances for
bereavement and for caring for sick children. It added 10 paid
hours of volunteer leave per month _ time, for example, that
parents can use to help at their children's schools. And it created
a reimbursement program that allows employees to use an on-site
day-care center in emergencies or to get in-home assistance when a
regular care provider is not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves if we as employer were saying to employees,
`There are many reasons why you may need to be absent or away from
work,''' said Fannie Mae vice chairman Jamie Gorelick. ``It's a
more mature approach to the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need is recognized up front,'' she added, rather than
being ignored until the worker calls in to say he or she will not
be coming in that day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all businesses see it that way. ``On any given
day, supervisors or directors at most companies really don't know
who's working and who's not,'' said Edward Muldoon, vice president
of disability management services at Prudential Insurance Co. in
Newark, N.J. ``Much less do they track it and attach a cost to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of knowledge has helped generate a cottage industry of
consultants who help employers minimize the costs of unscheduled
absences. For instance, Prudential, working with Work/Family
Directions, a benefits consulting firm based in Boston, has
developed a set of training materials intended to get employees
back to work promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential's absence-and-productivity program teaches managers
ways to discover the real reasons for absences, to make sure the
missing worker's job gets done and to handle chronic absentees. The
kit even includes a pen and a set of 12 greeting cards _ with
sentiments like ``We miss you,'' ``Get well soon,'' and
``Congratulations'' _ that supervisors can send to absent
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message of this is, `We do feel your absence here, and we
want you back soon,''' said Marybeth McKeown, manager of client
support at Prudential. ``We do everything but write out the card
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudential has supplied hundreds of kits to clients in the last
year and also uses them in its own operations.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of such a program is easy to understand. If
employees aren't working, productivity suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Productivity is all-important in today's competitive
environment,'' said Gibson of CCH. ``Companies are asking employees
to give 110 percent, but the difference we're seeing now is that
they're also starting to ask them how they can help them achieve
that.''

JAPAN SAYS PLAN WILL EASE BANKING CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Giving in to international pressure, Japanese leaders Thursday
announced a comprehensive plan to resolve a banking crisis that has
threatened to drag the United States economy into Asia's financial
woes.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain of bad loans that has piling up in Japanese banks
for years has reached more than $550 billion _ twice the size of
the US's bailout of Texas savings and loan institutions a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of Japan's plan were unsurprising, approval
came two weeks ahead of schedule and was viewed as tacit
acknowledgement that efforts to rescue the financial system are the
government's highest priority. The Japanese plan, which is modeled
on the US bailout plan, will be submitted to the Diet for approval
after national elections July 12.
</P>
<P>
   US Treasury Department officials, who went to Tokyo last month
to pressure the Japanese government to shut teetering banks and
restore public confidence in the financial system, were encouraged
by the detailed measures laid out in a policy statement.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Japan's new bailout plan, there is widespread
concern among government officials and economists the country will
be slow to impose on the taxpayers and businesses the painful and
costly measures required to overhaul rapidly deteriorating
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition that the problems in the large banks have to
be addressed, that selective and targeted use of public money is
necessary, and the importance of selling off bad assets rapidly ...
_ all are potentially constructive,'' a senior Treasury official
said Thursday in reaction to Japan's announcement. ``But what is
important for the crucial goal of market confidence is
implementation through timetables and concrete actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The world is watching Japan closely. The future of Southeast
Asian countries already in political and economic turmoil hinges on
how quickly Japan can deal with its crisis and keep the yen from
sliding further. Economists fear that as Japan sinks further into
recession because banks are unable to lend, it could place a drag
on a thriving US economy or tip it into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets seemed unimpressed by the plan. The US dollar
rose to 140.99 yen in New York trading, Thursdayup from 138.07 late
Wednesday. Japan's 225-stock Nikkei index moved up 0.66 percent,
closing at 16,471.58.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've announced things before,'' Edward J. Kane, a banking
professor at Boston College, said about Japan's plan. ``There's an
incentive for politicians to understate the problem to the voters
because the taxpayers get angry about having to pay these bills,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of Japan's problems is unknown. Nor is it known how
many of Japan's 19 primary banks are in trouble. Some are
estimating the bad loans are as high as $1 trillion. Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto has been criticized for failing to face up to
problems left after a speculative ``bubble'' in real estate and
stock prices popped in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga announced the plan
immediately after it was approved Thursday by a special government
task force set up last month. ``It is of utmost importance that we
restore confidence in our banking system,'' Matsunaga said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of Japan's Ministry of Finance who briefed
reporters said he expects the pace of mergers in the financial
sector to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   He also said if the 30 trillion yen ($213 billion) earmarked
earlier this year to stabilize the industry was not enough, further
steps would be taken. ``When you go above 30 trillion yen and some
measures need to be taken, there are various measures, ways to
resort to public resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has infected some of the biggest banks, according to
former US regulators advising Japan. The Long Term Credit Bank of
Japan Inc., which has been on shaky ground, said this week it would
merge with Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. in a private sector
solution that would create the country's second-biggest bank, with
$310 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plan would create what is known as a ``bridge
bank'' to provide a temporary home for troubled institutions and
their borrowers. The term is borrowed from government-run
organizations set up by US regulators to oversee Texas banks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, government accountants will comb the
books of financial institutions to pinpoint those in the worst
condition. Troubled banks would be transferred to bridge banks and
run by a newly created holding company known as the Heisei
Financial Revitalization Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There is as much concern about protecting Japan's relatively
healthy banks as there is about dispensing with the bad ones. A
primary goal of the bridge bank is to keep credit flowing to
healthy bank customers as the government takes over insolvent
banks.
</P>
<P>
   As was done when Texas and New England institutions failed,
assets backing the bad loans _ whether real estate or the
collateral from failed businesses _ would be sold to help recoup
the cost to taxpayers of keeping the troubled financial system
afloat.

PRESIDENT REITERATES ECOLOGY PLEA DURING TRIP ALONG LI RIVER 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILIN, China _ Admiring the sharp peaks along the Li River,
President Clinton and his family took a water cruise Thursday after
urging China to cut pollution through the use of clean energy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, before heading to Hong Kong, the final stop on his
nine-day journey, spoke to community leaders at a local park where
he called on China to adopt clean energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any loss of economic opportunity we can conserve
energy much more than we do; we can use clean, as opposed to dirty,
energy sources much more than we do; we can adopt new technologies
to make the energy we have go further much more than we do,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on China to avoid the path taken by the United States
and Europe, which resulted in ``more and more pollution to get more
and more growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Later joined by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter
Chelsea, the president boarded a cruise boat called Panorama for a
three-hour tour down the picturesque Li River. Looking at the
spectacular tree-covered peaks, Clinton said, ``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also toured the Yucun Village where he visited
with a store owner, recounting how his grandfather owned a grocery
store in Hope, Ark. Clinton toyed with an abacus used by the
shopkeeper instead of a cash register, telling reporters that ``it
still works.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique landscape here has been the subject of Chinese
paintings and poetry for 2,000 years. A flood last week kept the
president's trip in doubt but the water receded and scores of
Chinese army soldiers cleaned up debris along the banks before the
Clintons' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   This rural region of China also is a step back into time. Rice
paddies hoed by hand line the highway. Water buffalo grazed at
will. Women washed clothes on rocks at the water's edge. Men in
bamboo skiffs fished for food. A young girl practiced tai-chi. A
thriving shopping market lined the cruise's end.
</P>
<P>
   The area, long popular with Chinese, is increasingly becoming a
tourist destination with international flights now from Hong Kong
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Chinese civilization first began to express itself
thousands of years ago, its poems and paintings have sung of the
beauty of the land, the air, the water. No place in China is more
evocative of the beauty of your country than Guilin,'' Clinton said
before his river tour.

<P>
   GLENARDEN, Md. -- The last verse of the Old Testament envisions
a day when the Lord ``will turn the hearts of fathers to their
children and the hearts of children to their fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Using that yardstick, America's fathers are far off course. Four
of ten children -- 28 million out of 70 million kids -- do not live
in homes with their biological fathers. Never in history has there
been such an abandonment of children by their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Those kids are six times as likely as those from intact homes to
be in poverty or commit suicide and 2-3 times as likely to drop out
of school, become pregnant or delinquent as teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Another 25 to 50 percent of fathers are emotionally absent from
their children. ``The average dad spends 37 seconds with a child a
day. Kids spend six hours a day watching TV. Where are they getting
their values?'' Deacon Lawrence Lee asked a gathering of 119
African-American dads gathered for a ``Great Dads'' seminar the day
before Father's Day at First Baptist Church of Glenarden, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Great Dads is a new national group holding seminars across the
country to teach an ``Action Plan for Being a Great Dad.'' It was
founded by Robert Hamrin, 51, an economist who quit a presidential
campaign in 1983 to work as a consultant so he could spend more
time with his kids, a son who is now 21, and twin daughters, now
aged 17.
</P>
<P>
   Hamrin is the author of ``Straight From a Dad's Heart,'' an
inspiring book that can be ordered for $13 from Great Dads, PO Box
7537, Fairfax Station, VA 22039.
</P>
<P>
   His seminar teaches ``The Six Basics of Being a Great Dad'':
</P>
<P>
   1. Provide Unconditional Love and Affection: Thousands of teens
were asked what single question they would like their parents to
answer. Fifty percent said, ``Do you love me?'' One way to show
that love is to see the uniqueness of each child, and to read them
such Scriptures as Psalm 139: ``I am fearfully and wonderfully
made.'' Hamrin also tells his kids each evening as they go to bed,
``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key step is to build up each child. For every criticism,
dads ought to give ten compliments -- the opposite of what most
dads do.
</P>
<P>
   2. Spend T-I-M-E. Men pour themselves into their careers, not
kids. Richard Halverson, former U.S. Senate Chaplain, confessed he
should have spent more time with his kids when they were young. His
5-year-old girl once asked, ``Daddy, how come you are hardly ever
home with us?'' Hamrin heard that question when his son was 2, and
he determined never to have that regret.
</P>
<P>
   Love is spelled T-I-M-E. Block out time, say two to four hours
on a weekend, or keep a list of mini-adventures, one or two-day
excursions: to an historical site, a national park or trail, a zoo.
Spend one-on-one time with each child. Take a daughter out on a
``date'' such as a restaurant meal just with her. Or ask your
child, ``How would you like to spend 90 minutes together today?''
</P>
<P>
   3. Communicate Constantly and Creatively: Teens do want to talk
to parents, but when asked who they turn to for help when in
stress, dads ranked 48th on the list. ``If you listen when they are
little, they'll be talking when the subjects are important,'' says
Hamrin. ``If you don't listen now, you may never know when the
truly important things aren't being shared with you.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Partner with Mom: The most important gift parents can give
children is a healthy and vibrant marriage. Tell your kids that
divorce will never be considered. Dads should let moms choose what
is to be done together on a weekly evening out. Parents should
present a united front to children on all matters.
</P>
<P>
   5. Instill Basic Moral and Spiritual Values. ``Write down three
things you are willing to do to contribute to your child's
spiritual development,'' said Deacon Lee. ``It is important for
your child to know that you had to make a journey of faith what God
brought you through.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Establish My Fathering Legacy. ``If you want greatness in
life, do not look for fame, fortune or promotions, but spend a lot
of time with your children, who will live after us,'' says Hamrin.
``Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who finds delight in his
commands. His children will be great in the land.'' (Psalm 112:1-2)
</P>
<P>
   I was so moved by the day that on Father's Day I penned a
two-page letter to each of my three grown sons, asking forgiveness
for my own failures as a dad, praising them for their achievements
that make me proud, and to underscore how much I love them.

NOVOTNA DOMINATES HINGES TO REACH WIMBLEDON FINAL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Jana Novotna sank to her knees on the cold
grass and pumped her fist with vengeful ferocity. Only the
29-year-old woman who has just taught a lesson to the same
teen-ager who robbed her of her chance to win Wimbledon last year
would comprehend the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Call it revenge, retribution, or a simple rematch, but Thursday
Novotna made the most of her semifinal assignment against the
top-ranked Martina Hingis and reached her third Wimbledon final
with an aggressive, athletic 6-4, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even more satisfying, Novotna had left the usually smiley Swiss
17-year-old slamming down her racquet in disgust after being beaten
by an oldster in her second consecutive Grand Slam. At the French
Open, it was the resurgent Monica Seles who pounded Hingis into
unwilling submission. Here it was Novotna, who has made a habit of
tearful exits at her favorite Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a triumphant 16-year-old Hingis became Wimbledon's
youngest champion since 1887 by winning the 1997 title at Novotna's
expense. But, after Hingis won three of the four Grand Slam titles
last year, even she acknowledges that her near-invincibility in
1997 has deserted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm not the player I was last year,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's finale, the third-seeded Novotna will face a
first-time Slam finalist in the 16th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat, at 30
a decidedly undecorated veteran on the cusp of becoming a has-been
even in her native France. Tauziat is a late-blooming net-rusher
like Novotna, and Thursday she celebrated her victory with similar
body language. She collapsed flat on her back on the Center Court
grass after she became the first Frenchwoman to reach a Wimbledon
final since the Suzanne Lenglen won this tournament in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat's first Grand Slam finale was achieved at the expense of
another member of tennis' hard-to-kill geriatric generation,
27-year-old Natasha Zvereva, who wilted in the final set of a 1-6,
7-6 (7-1), 6-3 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I'm not on the moon already, but almost,'' Tauziat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it is a long way up for Tauziat, who was thinking
about quitting the tour after a decade of lackluster results. It
took Tauziat 43 Grand Slam campaigns just to reach a semifinal,
more than any other player on the WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   She was elated that her belated breakthrough happened here on
the lawns that best reflect her predilection for serve-and-volley
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do if I win the final,'' she
said, ``but I'm very happy that it's in Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation between Novotna and Tauziat, whose career
rivalry is deadlocked at 4-4, will present the oldest pair of
Wimbledon finalists since the 31-year-old Virginia Wade won her
historic home turf title by defeating 32-year-old Betty Stove of
the Netherlands in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Novotna's fourth career Grand Slam final and her
third at Wimbledon. After her first, and most memorable title-round
defeat here in 1993, she cried on the shoulder of the Duchess of
Kent after fumbling away a 4-1 third-set lead against Steffi Graf.
She again received royal condolences after last year's loss to
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Novotna, the Duchess reminded her last year that
the third time might work like a charm, and so far, she has been on
target.
</P>
<P>
   Though Novotna came into Thursday's semifinal dragging a 2-6
record against Hingis, she not only ignored her four consecutive
losses to the clever counterpuncher but also finessed her way out
of a 0-3, 0-40 opening-set deficit. It was Hingis' turn to be
bedeviled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like up 3-0, 40-0, and after that, it just changed, like
this,'' Hingis said with an angry snap of her fingernails, ``and
everything just stuck in the net, and nothing would go over
anymore, and she was great at the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``She puts on a lot of pressure because she closes at net very
well,'' Hingis said. ``I hit some great shots, which against other
players would have been a point, but she always got it back somehow
with the slice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pestered by Novotna's continual backhand slicing and flustered
by her unapologetic monopoly of the net, Hingis spewed out 24
unforced errors and countless more forced mistakes. Half of her
volleys wound up in the net or soaring beyond bounds, and her
normally rapacious returns converted just three of the 10 break
chances Novotna allowed her. And on Hingis' service games,
Novotna's studious regrouping after every point had the youngster
impatiently stomping on the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis won the first 9 points of the match, but when Novotna
decided to pour on the pressure, Hingis had no answer to it. By the
time Novotna had broken her to take a 1-0 edge in the second set,
Hingis had lost seven of the last eight games. Ultimately, the
Swiss teen put Novotna in position to serve for the match by
dropping her serve with a backhand volley blooper to trail, 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to come in, I tried to stay back. I didn't know what
to do,'' said Hingis. ``I just wasn't patient enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who had drawn criticism with her offhand remarks about
the seven-time champion Graf being past her prime, had some kind
words Thursday for her elders. ``She's not the youngest player on
the tour anymore, but sometimes it seems like the older the
better,'' Hingis said, ``and if you see Tauziat on the other side
in the finals, it's amazing. I hope it's going to be that way with
me, also: the older, the smarter, the cleverer, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday belonged to Novotna. After beating her doubles
partner in singles, she teamed right back up with Hingis and
reached the semifinals of the women's doubles event, where they are
the top-seeded team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one year older than last year, but I feel so much younger,
really,'' Novotna said. ``I said to myself today, `I may be older,
but I'm still all over the court.'''

   I was so moved by the day that on Father's Day I penned a

for my own failures as a dad, praising them for their achievements
that make me proud, and to underscore how much I love them.

<P>
   GLENARDEN, Md. -- The last verse of the Old Testament envisions
a day when the Lord ``will turn the hearts of fathers to their
children and the hearts of children to their fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Using that yardstick, America's fathers are far off course. Four
of ten children -- 28 million out of 70 million kids -- do not live
in homes with their biological fathers. Never in history has there
been such an abandonment of children by their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Those kids are six times as likely as those from intact homes to
be in poverty or commit suicide and 2-3 times as likely to drop out
of school, become pregnant or delinquent as teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Another 25 to 50 percent of fathers are emotionally absent from
their children. ``The average dad spends 37 seconds with a child a
day. Kids spend six hours a day watching TV. Where are they getting
their values?'' Deacon Lawrence Lee asked a gathering of 119
African-American dads gathered for a ``Great Dads'' seminar the day
before Father's Day at First Baptist Church of Glenarden, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Great Dads is a new national group holding seminars across the
country to teach an ``Action Plan for Being a Great Dad.'' It was
founded by Robert Hamrin, 51, an economist who quit a presidential
campaign in 1983 to work as a consultant so he could spend more
time with his kids, a son who is now 21, and twin daughters, now
aged 17.
</P>
<P>
   Hamrin is the author of ``Straight From a Dad's Heart,'' an
inspiring book that can be ordered for $13 from Great Dads, PO Box
7537, Fairfax Station, VA 22039.
</P>
<P>
   His seminar teaches ``The Six Basics of Being a Great Dad'':
</P>
<P>
   1. Provide Unconditional Love and Affection: Thousands of teens
were asked what single question they would like their parents to
answer. Fifty percent said, ``Do you love me?'' One way to show
that love is to see the uniqueness of each child, and to read them
such Scriptures as Psalm 139: ``I am fearfully and wonderfully
made.'' Hamrin also tells his kids each evening as they go to bed,
``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key step is to build up each child. For every criticism,
dads ought to give ten compliments -- the opposite of what most
dads do.
</P>
<P>
   2. Spend T-I-M-E. Men pour themselves into their careers, not
kids. Richard Halverson, former U.S. Senate Chaplain, confessed he
should have spent more time with his kids when they were young. His
5-year-old girl once asked, ``Daddy, how come you are hardly ever
home with us?'' Hamrin heard that question when his son was 2, and
he determined never to have that regret.
</P>
<P>
   Love is spelled T-I-M-E. Block out time, say two to four hours
on a weekend, or keep a list of mini-adventures, one or two-day
excursions: to an historical site, a national park or trail, a zoo.
Spend one-on-one time with each child. Take a daughter out on a
``date'' such as a restaurant meal just with her. Or ask your
child, ``How would you like to spend 90 minutes together today?''
</P>
<P>
   3. Communicate Constantly and Creatively: Teens do want to talk
to parents, but when asked who they turn to for help when in
stress, dads ranked 48th on the list. ``If you listen when they are
little, they'll be talking when the subjects are important,'' says
Hamrin. ``If you don't listen now, you may never know when the
truly important things aren't being shared with you.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Partner with Mom: The most important gift parents can give
children is a healthy and vibrant marriage. Tell your kids that
divorce will never be considered. Dads should let moms choose what
is to be done together on a weekly evening out. Parents should
present a united front to children on all matters.
</P>
<P>
   5. Instill Basic Moral and Spiritual Values. ``Write down three
things you are willing to do to contribute to your child's
spiritual development,'' said Deacon Lee. ``It is important for
your child to know that you had to make a journey of faith what God
brought you through.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Establish My Fathering Legacy. ``If you want greatness in
life, do not look for fame, fortune or promotions, but spend a lot
of time with your children, who will live after us,'' says Hamrin.
``Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who finds delight in his
commands. His children will be great in the land.'' (Psalm 112:1-2)
</P>
<P>
   I was so moved by the day that on Father's Day I penned a
two-page letter to each of my three grown sons, asking forgiveness
for my own failures as a dad, praising them for their achievements
that make me proud, and to underscore how much I love them.

NOTES SHOW FED IS STILL WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related story, ECON-REPORT) 
(JT) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite signs that the economy might be slowing,
the Federal Reserve remained concerned at its May meeting about a
potential outbreak of inflation. Two of the 12 members on the Fed's
policy-making committee voted against the panel's decision then to
hold interest rates steady.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes of the May 19 meeting, released Thursday, suggested that
there was considerable unease within the policy-making group, the
Federal Open Market Committee, about waiting any longer for an
economic slowdown that always seemed to be just around the corner
but never quite materialized. For some members, the minutes said,
the decision not to raise rates ``was a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee voted to hold the federal funds target
rate, the primary short-term rate controlled by the Fed, steady at
5.5 percent, it decided then to maintain its formal policy ``bias''
toward a tighter monetary policy, the minutes said, a signal that
it continues to lean toward raising rates in the absence of a clear
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The two members who bucked Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and
voted for an immediate interest rate increase were Jerry Jordan,
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and William
Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who
was attending only his second meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had also voted to raise rates at the Fed's March 31
meeting, where he was the lone dissenter. One of the features of
Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman has been to encourage consensus
on interest-rate decisions, and it has been more than four years
since as many as two members broke with the majority on a vote. It
is particularly unusual that a relatively new member like Poole,
who took office on March 23, would dissent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Fed again decided to keep interest rates on
hold after a two-day meeting. The decision came in the wake of
further evidence that Asia's financial crisis is helping to slow
growth to noninflationary levels. Those reports were reinforced
Thursday by the news that the unemployment rate edged up in June to
4.5 percent from 4.3 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes of this week's meeting will be released on Aug. 20, two
days after the Fed's next policy-setting session.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes of the May 19 meeting provided only a dry and
sketchy account of the day's debate.
</P>
<P>
   But the minutes gave a summary of the reasoning of Poole and
Jordan in dissenting from the decision to keep policy on hold. Both
men are monetarists who believe that clues to the likelihood of a
resurgence of inflation can be discerned in the growth of the money
supply. Although rapid money supply growth was discredited as a
predictor of inflation during the mid-1980s because of sweeping
changes to the nation's financial structure, it has lately shown
signs of becoming a reliable early warning signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Poole dissented because he believed that the sustained
increase in money growth in recent quarters and associated
accommodative conditions in the credit markets pointed to rising
inflation,'' the minutes said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the minutes said, was concerned that the rapid growth in
the money supply was fueling speculative excesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his view, these high growth rates were fueling
unsustainably rapid increases of real estate and other asset
prices, and reports of `too much cash chasing too few deals' were
becoming more frequent,'' the minutes said. Ultimately, Jordan
said, the Fed faced ``a choice between smaller increases in
interest rates sooner versus larger increases later.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the committee who voted to keep rates unchanged
cited a variety of reasons for not moving, according to the
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They said they believed that companies would want to run down
the surprisingly large inventories of supplies and goods they had
built up in the first quarter, resulting in reduced demand. And
they expressed concern that Asia's economic condition continued to
deteriorate, likely leading to further downturns in demand for
American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the failure of domestic demand to moderate in line
with their earlier expectations, the members were persuaded that
appreciable slowing in the growth of economic activity was a likely
prospect over the course of coming quarters even though its exact
timing and extent was unknown,'' the minutes said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing their decision not to raise rates, the minutes said,
was concern that any increase could have ``outsized effects'' on
Asian financial markets, potentially leading to ``substantial
adverse repercussions on U.S. financial markets and, over time, on
the U.S. economy,'' the minutes said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee added, however, ``that market
considerations could not be allowed to jeopardize the effective
conduct of a U.S. monetary policy aimed at an optimal performance
of the U.S. economy,'' the minutes said. ``Indeed, such a
performance would best serve the interests of troubled financial
markets and economies abroad.''

ALGERIA TO ADMIT U.N. FACT-FINDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Algeria, which has for months resisted outside
efforts to investigate the violence that has killed tens of
thousands of Algerians since 1992, has agreed to admit a high-level
international political mission, the United Nations announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, which the United Nations describes as ``a panel of
eminent persons,'' is expected to leave soon for a fact-finding
trip, after which it is to report to Secretary-General Kofi Annan
on a series of massacres, some of which human-rights groups
attribute to Islamic extremists and some to military death squads.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be led by former President Mario Soares of
Portugal. He will be accompanied by Donald McHenry, a former U.S.
representative at the United Nations; Inder Kumar Gujral, former
prime minister of India; Abdel Karim Kabariti, former prime
minister of Jordan; Simone Veil, a former French Cabinet minister,
and Amos Wako, attorney general of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The officials will be buttressed by a contingent of U.N.
technical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria has suffered six years of violence and massacres of
civilians since an election in 1992 was canceled when Islamic
radicals pulled into the lead in what was to have been a two-stage
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Requests by Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human
rights, to investigate the abuses have been rebuffed by the
Algerians. This time, however, the government has promised to
cooperate with the new team.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Eight industrial nations urged Algeria last month
to allow a U.N. mission to study the violence. On Thursday the
secretary-general's spokesman announced that Algeria had agreed
without conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Algeria has assured the secretary-general
that it will insure free and complete access to all sources of
information necessary for the panel to exercise its functions in
order to have a clear vision and a precise perception of the
reality of the situation in all its dimensions in Algeria today,''
the announcement said.

   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ Far from the center of New York's
literary hub, in a flat-topped industrial building fringed by
Florida palms and flaming pink hibiscus, is a publisher that
produces steamy books in a bouillon of chicken soup flavors.
</P>
<P>
   There is little about the publisher, Health Communications, that
is conventional except that it ladles up best sellers: three
currently on the New York Times paperback best-seller lists last
weekend, including ``Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul,'' the 17th
book in its warm, shivery and carefully formatted Chicken Soup
series of simplistic and homespun inspirational parables of love,
kindness and triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The company rarely pays author advances, loathes advertising,
binds its own books, offers a company Bikram yoga room and made one
critical business decision based on the teary emotional response of
its co-founder and president, Peter Vegso.
</P>
<P>
   Vegso recalls being so overcome by the original manuscript of
``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' that he could not continue reading.
That did not prevent him, though, from making a calculating
business judgment that has resulted in the sale of 30 million
copies of assorted Chicken Soup titles and ambitious plans to pour
out 75 versions catering to souls from country music fans to
Muslims to orthodontists.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of rare, consistent success with a title that
makes other large trade publishers misty for more practical
reasons. ``There's absolutely nothing that comes close to it in all
of the rest of publishing,'' said Laurence Kirshbaum, the chairman
of Time Warner Trade Publishing, which includes Warner Books.
``They are the dream not only of small publishers, but large
publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Health Communications are hardly literary and Vegso
is the first to concede that ``when we started in the publishing
business, we didn't know how to do it.'' So he and his partner,
Gary Seidler, did not know it was heretical to offer authors no
advances or that it was highly unusual for a publisher to own its
own a printing press _ let alone for its executives to don blue
jean and operate it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the two men headed south for Florida from their native
Canada in a Volkswagen Beetle. They had a $10,000 grant to sustain
them, along with their skills as a marketing director and a press
officer for the Addiction Resource Foundation in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to the United States to capitalize on the growth
in drug and alcohol treatment programs by starting a newspaper
aimed at the recovery movement. Eventually they bought their own
printing press to publish pamphlets and books, discovering many of
their authors through conferences that they organized for
counselors and therapists.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years that followed, the company experienced a scary
cycle of rising and falling and rising revenues that could be a
fitting parable for a Chicken Soup for the Publisher's Soul.
</P>
<P>
   Sales plunged in the early 1990s with reductions in government
spending and health-care insurance subsidies for addiction recovery
programs, according to Vegso. Suddenly there was a glut on the
market of therapy-related books as larger trade publishers entered
the field and Health Communications scrambled to keep pace by
pumping chapter-length ideas into full-scale books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a free for all,'' recalled Vegso. ``We just published
it to death.'' When its revenues, which had reached $17 million in
1990, dropped by 50 percent in 1991 to about $8.5 million and 50
percent more the following year, Health Communications laid off
employees, scaled back its schedule of conferences, and
concentrated on its backlist of steady selling perennial books.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this lull in the company's fortunes in 1992 that
Vegso and Seidler encountered two would-be authors and professional
motivational speakers, Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield. With a
rich history of rejection, Hansen and Canfield had come to the
annual convention of the American Booksellers Association in
Southern California carrying the ``Chicken Soup for the Soul''
manuscripts, dozens of uplifting tales they had written themselves
and compiled from other sources, stuffed in their backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three trade publishers had already dismissed the
manuscript, recalled Hansen, who said that essentially the various
editors believed that short stories did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   These were quirky upbeat tales offering lessons in love and
kindness: a rider thanking a cranky New York cabbie for a ``superb
ride'' in hopes that one compliment will multiply in niceness to 20
more fares; a hugging judge who revels in an embrace with a nursing
home patient who smiles for the first time in 23 years; a woman who
is certain that the heart of a mute stroke victim is beating out
the words, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We said these aren't short stories,'' said Hansen, 50, who
lives in Newport Beach, Calif. ``These are visceral stories that
touch the soul. They didn't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Communications did. ``I didn't know I was the 34th
publisher and I really didn't care,'' Vegso said. ``I said, `Sure,
let's do it.' I was in the airport reading it and I was in tears. I
had to stop because I thought people would think there was
something wrong with a grown man crying in the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   It took more than a year for the first Chicken Soup to claw its
way onto The New York Times best-seller list. Health Communications
benefited from the fact that the authors were professional speakers
and tireless promoters, who developed their own intensive marketing
system, which included the fundamental daily rule of seeking ``five
media hits,'' or interviews, with small radio stations, newspapers
and regional television shows.
</P>
<P>
   The authors also sought unconventional outlets for their books,
from bakeries and nail salons to motivational seminars and pet food
stores. They asked dozens of their friends to buy 100 books each to
sell to their friends. They persuaded Celestial Seasonings to print
sample stories on its tea boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it bypass marketing,'' said Hansen, the co-author of
the series. ``Health Communications is the publisher and the
distributor and we're going to do all the promoting and marketing.
As you know, a book usually has 30 days on the market before they
pull it off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   And for their long list of sequel books, the two authors created
a focus group of readers and friends, Hansen said, who literally
grade stories for ``goosebumpy'' buttery emotions on a scale of 1
to 10.
</P>
<P>
   These critical lessons of self-promotion are factors that Health
Communications weighs when it picks its authors, who typically are
professional speakers with established forums to promote their own
books.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It published two unlikely paperback best sellers this year, ``A
Child Called `It''' and its sequel, ``The Lost Boy,'' which are
based on the grim childhood memories of Dave Pelzer, a professional
speaker from California with a keen sense of humor who, as he puts
it, can talk in a disarming way that ``makes child abuse funny.''
</P>
<P>
   His first book _ written in a simple child's voice, but without
the lyricism of Frank McCourt's childhood chronicle ``Angela's
Ashes'' _ is a relentless description of his abuse at his late
mother's hand. Pelzer accuses her of every level of torture from
beatings to knife wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The book was first published in 1993 and initially did not sell
that well, according to Pelzer, who decided to invest his own money
in promotion by hiring several regional public relations firms and
increasing his speaking engagements, which finally culminated in a
breakthrough appearance in 1997 on ``The Montel Williams Show''
that increased sales dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Pelzer said that he was initially referred to Health
Communications by one of the Chicken Soup authors. ``They were
small and privately owned and I'm thinking that with a bigger house
I might get more money, but I might get lost in the shuffle,'' he
said. ``One of the things that impressed me is that Peter sent me a
letter welcoming me to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, Pelzer would truly make it a family, becoming
engaged to his editor from Health Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Chicken Soup and Pelzer's two titles has
obviously made a difference in Health Communication's fortunes,
increasing its revenue to $85 million last year, according to
Vegso. And like any small publisher, he is well aware that at any
time one of his larger rivals in distant New York might try to
snatch away one of his successful authors.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are a host of imitators of the Chicken Soup series
by rival publishers and knock-offs from Health Communications
itself (``Taste-Berry Tales: Stories to Lift the Spirit, Fill the
Heart and Feed the Soul,'' or ``Puppies for Sale and Other
Inspirational Tales.'')
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Vegso's partner, Seidler, decided to withdraw from
full-time work at the company to act as a consultant to Health
Communications, but Vegso said he remained content to stay at the
company, dividing his time between books and his horse breeding

   Leaning back in his office chair, he toyed with a hand-crocheted
chicken given to him by a reader while talking about why he enjoys
his job so much. His reasons are the sweet essence of Chicken Soup
parables. ``I like the fact that we help a lot of people,'' he
said. ``People will come up and say that you've saved my life.
That's nice.''

GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' LABOR AND BUSINESS FACTIONS CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic
challenger to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany's national
elections in September, has gone out of his way to polish his image
as a leader who would be good for business.
</P>
<P>
   But when Schroeder personally introduced members of his
potential future cabinet Monday in Berlin, one person was
conspicuously absent: the man who would be his economics minister.
</P>
<P>
   And that was no accident. Jolz Stollmann, a 43-year-old,
self-made millionaire who started and recently sold his own
computer-networking company, had just left for vacation. Before
leaving, Stollmann had announced that he would not play a role in
the election campaign or be a spokesman for the Social Democrats'
economic program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a politician and I'm not participating in the
election campaign,'' Stollmann said in an interview late last week.
``There are others who are more capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months before the vote, Germany's Social
Democrats have a strong chance of beating Kohl and his center-right
Christian Democrats for the first time in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the strains between the party's left-leaning traditionalists
and Schroeder's comparatively pro-business wing are also becoming
more apparent. Germany's powerful union leaders who hold sway in
the party have been infuriated by Stollmann's nomination, accusing
him of being hostile to workers. Rank-and-file party members,
meanwhile, have been rattled by the elevation of an outsider who
plainly comes from a different world.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has borrowed unabashedly from the election strategies
of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Clinton,
packaging himself as a pro-business Social Democrat who could do
more than his conservative rivals to stimulate the German economy
and reduce sky-high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Naming Stollmann, a political outsider who brought an aura of
Silicon Valley-style success, has been his most visible gesture
toward business. A graduate of Harvard Business School who worked
for a time at the Boston Consulting Group, Stollmann started his
own company at the age of 29. Last year, the company, Compunet AG,
which provides computer-networking services, had sales of about $1
billion and was recently sold to General Electric Co. of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, he had never held any political office and does
not belong to a political party. The closest he came to politics
was three years ago, when he ran a prominent newspaper campaign to
rebut critics who said Germany had become too expensive, lazy and
rigid for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A land without a future? Rubbish!'' said one ad in bold block
letters. ``Sleeping government workers? Nonsense!''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those opinions, Stollmann is a pragmatist. ``The days
of ideological battles between left and right are over,'' he said.
``The issue is having the political leadership and the political
process that can lead to renewal. I can bring a certain leadership
to bring together some of the best minds in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stollmann immediately touched off hostility within the
party. By pointedly distancing himself from Social Democratic
policies, he aroused suspicions of disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not enough, Stollmann has been openly skeptical
about one of the Social Democrats' core ideas: reducing joblessness
through a broad ``Alliance for Work'' between government, labor and
industry. Party officials say political leaders might offer to
loosen regulations, and unions would be willing to restrain wage
increases in return for more ambitious corporate hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need what Americans might call `a change coalition,'''
Stollmann said. ``But that kind of change coalition cannot decide
how many new jobs are going to be created. We are a market economy
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   German union leaders were outraged by what they took to be
Stollmann's dismissive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stollmann obviously has a lot to learn, when he discredits
the Alliance for Work as meaningless,'' said Franz-Josef
Moellenberg, chairman of the food workers' union. ``We hope he
learns quickly. If not, he is the wrong man for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has not yet betrayed any concern. ``I expressly wanted
him to keep his own mind, because I rely on his independence,'' he
said at a party gathering last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stollmann acknowledged that he has already run afoul of
traditionalists. ``The people who don't like these ideas are
playing the old-fashioned political game,'' he said. ``They are
trying to spread distrust between me and the Social Democratic
Party members, and I need their trust.''

`THE WINDS OF GOD': POWERFUL _ AND PERHAPS COURAGEOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Masayuki Imai's play ``The Winds of God,'' two
comedians in modern Tokyo recover memories they were unaware they
had lost, and with them a chapter of history often avoided in Japan
as simply too bitter to dwell on. Wiped out in a motorcycle
accident on a Tokyo street, they find themselves reincarnated as
airmen training to be kamikaze pilots in the final days of World
War II. Other pilots in the squadron all treat them like old
friends, and gradually the two realize that the men they now
inhabit must have been former selves who died on suicide missions
to destroy American ships.
</P>
<P>
   Imai, a popular film and television star in Japan, wrote the
play in English. In the production at the Judith Anderson Theater,
he and six other Japanese actors, all making their New York debuts,
exchange jokes, insults and confidences so easily they leave the
impression that smart American street talk is their native tongue.
This is all the more striking since tone and inflection reveal many
unspoken meanings in a work that is more subtle and complex than it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   The comedians are very funny, in part because they are not very
good at their trade. Their plunge into a past they had only vaguely
heard of gradually becomes a painful enlightenment as they discover
not only the harshness, fanaticism and cruelty of the old
militaristic society but also its discipline and patriotism. The
period's unselfish dedication makes the rich, self-satisfied
individualism of half a century later seem tawdry.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is laughter almost to the last lines, this cast,
directed by Imai, lets one feel the intense emotional and spiritual
struggles of each pilot in the squad, a group of strong
personalities marked by the idealism, hopes and fears of youth.
</P>
<P>
   There are passages that descend into melodrama, a military
training scene that is nothing but noise, and the last episode
seems a peculiarly awkward conclusion to an elegant exploration of
the unaccountable influence of history on the individual. But on
the whole, ``The Winds of God'' (virtually a translation of
kamikaze) is a powerful play, perhaps a courageous one. It
effectively pulverizes an assumption we all too readily make: that
we can easily comprehend the past and fairly judge our forebears.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ NASCAR officials were expecting to make
history this week, and they did. But postponing the Pepsi 400 is
not what they had in mind.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Winston Cup event scheduled for Saturday night, which was
going to be the first NASCAR race televised by a major network in
prime time, was postponed Thursday because of the raging wildfires
that have engulfed a large portion of northeast Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The event has been rescheduled for the evening of Oct. 17, with
qualifying Oct. 15-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fires intensified, we felt the right thing to do was
postpone the race and focus all our efforts on helping the
community fight this situation,'' said John Graham, president of
the Daytona International Speedway. ``The emergency people we would
have had at the track this week will be at the fires now. This is a
most difficult situation. The community is our primary focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the area around the speedway is under a mandatory
evacuation. Interstate 95, which is a main road for spectators
coming to the speedway, was closed in both directions at Daytona
Beach. It would have been nearly impossible to get cars in and out
of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires south and west of Daytona Beach have caused a smoky
haze over the 2.5-mile racetrack, which would have made a dangerous
situation for the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying was scheduled for Thursday night and tonight before
the first-ever Winston Cup night race at DIS. It was expected to be
a milestone event for NASCAR because of CBS' live coverage, but the
first prime-time broadcast might have to wait a year.
</P>
<P>
   CBS officials will make a decision next week about whether they
will carry the race in October. Two things are working against CBS
opting to cover the race _ the entertainment division already may
have sold advertising for original programming on that date, and
the World Series begins that night on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible the race will be shown on cable network TNN, but
that would be a far cry from the original plans with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all are very frustrated,'' CBS commentator Ralph Sheheen
said. ``We had this date circled on our calendars. There was a real
buzz about this race.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million lighting project at the speedway, which was done
over the past year and completed last month, is believed to be the
largest ever for a sports arena. It required 1,835 lamps around the
tri-oval to generate as much light as the high beams of 87,000
passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   Musco Lighting, which installed the lights, said the lighting
was equivalent to the standard residential lights of 24,285 city
blocks on a road stretching from Daytona Beach to Musco's
headquarters in Muscatine, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had ever tried to put this much light on something this
big,'' Musco president Joe Crookham said.
</P>
<P>
   Having to postpone the event is a huge disappointment for race
officials, especially since the race was a sellout for the first
time. All 143,000 grandstand seats had been sold, and at least
30,000 more spectators were expected in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maintained all along that we would not do anything
that might compromise public safety,'' DIS media director John
Story said. ``After talking about it throughout the night
(Wednesday), we decided the responsible thing to do was to postpone
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This possibility has been in the back of our minds since the
wildfire problem began, but we were confident we could get the race
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous Pepsi 400 races were run during the day on July 4 in
scorching heat, which kept some fans from attending. But the chance
to see a Winston Cup race under the lights in cooler conditions
obviously was appealing to the expected crowd of more than 175,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fans need to hold on to their tickets because they will
be honored in October,'' Story said. ``The same is true for the
tickets for the qualifying nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fans already had arrived and parked their
recreational vehicles in the infield, but they packed up and headed
out when they heard the news Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down there earlier, and a lady from Pennsylvania heard
me talking to some drivers,'' Story said. ``She walked up to me and
said she was sorry she had come so far, but she knew we were doing
the right thing. That seems to be how most people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the drivers arrived Wednesday but learned less than 24
hours later they would be heading home for the Fourth of July
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to see this happen,'' said John Andretti, who won the
event last year. ``But it was obvious that things with the fires
got so much worse the last two days that there was no way they
could carry on with the race.''
</P>
<P>
   By moving the event to Oct. 17, it means Winston Cup teams will
have to race on 16 consecutive weekends, starting with the
Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi 400 gains some added pressure for the drivers in the
points chase for the championship since it will be closer to the
season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta on Nov. 8.

NEW YORK TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON SWISS BANKS SEPT. 1 IF NO ACCORD
REACHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moving in `a' category) 
(JT) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officials of the City and State of New York said
Thursday that they would begin imposing sanctions on Swiss banks on
Sept. 1, hoping that the two-month ``cooling off period'' would
persuade Swiss bank officials and lawyers for Holocaust survivors
and heirs to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Barring Swiss banks from bidding on overnight deposits, which
average more than $2 billion just for the city, would be the first
step, followed in stages by barring other business, canceling
existing contracts and selling all stocks in Swiss companies.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said sanctions, last used to bring pressure
to end apartheid in South Africa, were ``unjustified, unwarranted
and counterproductive'' to reaching a quick settlement of the
claims of Holocaust survivors, whose average age is 81.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions could undermine New York's position as the financial
capital of the global economy by raising doubts about how open
American financial markets are, Under Secretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat said in an interview. He also said that he had urged the
Swiss government to ``not overreact'' to the sanctions and
retaliate with actions that could make a settlement more difficult
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Two Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, offered $600 million
last month to settle claims.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Weiss, one of the lawyers for the survivors, heirs and
charities representing heirless assets, proposed settling the case
for $1.5 billion, provided the Swiss government and the Swiss
National Bank joined in a ``global settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks collapsed after Weiss made his proposal last month.
The sanctions were announced by the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi,
and the state Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a day after a meeting in
which they said that the Swiss consul general in New York, Jacques
Reverdin, told a panel of state and local government finance
officials that the Swiss government would never contribute to a
restitution fund.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said Reverdin's statements revealed a change from the
posture the Swiss government had taken in private talks, which he
said was to signal it would ease a ``global settlement'' to resolve
all claims. These, he said, would include those against the Swiss
government and its Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said the Swiss government's position amounted to
``denying moral responsibility'' for buying stolen assets,
including gold removed from the teeth of Nazi death-camp victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``No punishment is being asked, no penalty,'' Hevesi said. ``It
is restitution we seek.''
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi pointed to a May 25 report by a panel created by the
Swiss government, known as the Bergier Commission, which concluded
that by 1942 Swiss government officials knew the gold the Nazis
sold to them was looted from Jews, a practice that was so obvious
that it could be discerned by careful readers of Swiss newspapers.
He said the report should have spurred the Swiss government to
``prepare its people'' to support a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Reverdin said that the Swiss government had been unwavering in
its position that all claims concerning assets that the Nazis stole
from Jews and then sold to the Swiss National Bank were resolved by
a 1946 agreement reached in Washington and signed by the World War
II Allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a settled matter and there is no reason to reopen
it,'' Reverdin said.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said the Swiss government had never changed its
position that it would support any settlement that the two banks
might reach, but that it was not a party to the talks and was not
obligated to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banks were paid about $31 million in investment fees by
the city in the last year, more than 10 percent of the $285 million
that the city spent on investment management, advice and broker
commissions, Steve Newman, the first deputy city comptroller,
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office could not immediately supply comparable figures.
</P>
<P>
   If all 800 state and local government finance officers were to
terminate short-term investment dealings with Swiss banks, the
annual fees would quickly total more than the $900 million
difference between the banks' offer and Weiss' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions plan calls for the city and state to begin
sanctions on Sept. 1 by barring overnight investments with Swiss
banks, new letters of credit agreements and taking part in
underwriting new state and city debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, if no settlement is reached, Hevesi and McCall will
recommend excluding Swiss companies like Scudder Kemper Investments
and SBC Warburg Dillon Read &AMP; Co. from searches for new pension
fund investment managers and barring existing managers from doing
business through Swiss companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the two officials would recommend canceling existing
investment management contracts, like a CS First Boston contract to
manage $740 million for the city pension fund. They would also ask
the Legislature and City Council to pass laws barring Swiss
companies from selling goods and services to the state and city.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on July 1, 1999, they would seek to have the $106
billion state pension fund and the $82 billion city pension fund
begin divesting their holdings in Swiss companies. The city owns
$735 million in stock in Swiss companies, including $136.7 million
in the Swiss banks, Hevesi said.

2 AMISH ARRAIGNED IN DRUG-DISTRIBUTION SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ At a glance, they looked little different from
any other defendant indicted on illegal drug charges. Standing
before Judge Jay Waldman at their arraignment in U.S. District
Court Thursday morning, the two men with the same name looked
frightened, anxious, perhaps even a little embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Abner King Stoltzfus, 23, and Abner Stoltzfus, 24, who
are not related, are anomalies in the federal criminal justice
system. Authorities here say they are the first two members of
Pennsylvania's Amish community to be arrested for involvement with
cocaine and methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Along with eight members and associates of a motorcycle gang
known as the Pagans, the Stoltzfuses were indicted after a
five-year investigation in Lancaster County, and they now face
charges that could bring them a mandatory minimum of 10 years in
prison. Nine of the defendants, including the Amish men, pleaded
not guilty; a 10th defendant, Natalie King, is to be arraigned next
week.
</P>
<P>
   As Waldman explained the procedure to each of the Stoltzfuses,
seven of their relatives and close friends, all dressed in typical
Amish wear, sat silently in the third row of the courtroom, hiding
their somber faces from courtroom artists in accordance with their
belief that it is a sin of vanity to have your likeness reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Amish have lived lives different yet not
entirely apart from mainstream America. In their eastern
Pennsylvania communities of Gap, Intercourse, Paradise and other
small towns, they work as farmers, craftsmen and small-business
owners who have raised families under the strictures of their
church and the quaint ways of a bygone era: They eschew such basic
conveniences as electricity and travel in horse-drawn buggies.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, they have been poster people for all that America
cherishes: strong family values, accountability, responsibility, a
deep faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, suburban sprawl westward from Philadelphia
has invaded their turf. Though it has brought new jobs at a time
when fewer Amish are tending to farms that are generations old, it
has also brought them wider exposure to commercial America and the
fast-paced enticements of modern life, which includes, as the
Stoltzfuses' case may demonstrate, some of its unsavory elements.
</P>
<P>
   Were it only alcohol involved in charges against them, the
levels of surprise and bewilderment among the Amish might not have
been so high. Typically, Amish teen-agers are permitted several
years of discovery outside the traditions of family and church to
help them decide whether they want to re-enter their church and
community for the rest of their lives. Often during that period,
known as timeout, the youth join groups that meet in social
settings the Amish call hoedowns, where tabooed activities like
drinking, smoking and driving cars are common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are a-changing,'' Robert Ham, who has been the police
chief for 28 years in Strasburg, a Lancaster County town of 3,000,
said in an interview earlier this week. ``Their young folks get out
into the world. They believe in sowing their wild oats while
they're young.''

<P>
   But it was not until recently that Amish elders had any notion
that some of their young might be involved with illegal drugs. Ham
said he was not surprised, inasmuch as many Amish young men, like
the Stoltzfuses, residents of Gap who earn money as roofers, find
work outside their communities, where temptations loom closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're no different than anybody else,'' Ham said. ``They're
looking for the bigger and better high.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For now, it is unclear what the Stoltzfuses might have been
looking for, if anything. The government contends that they joined
with Pagans and others in a scheme to distribute cocaine and
methamphetamine over a five-year period through last July. Lawyers
for the Amish men declined Thursday to discuss the case, which is
scheduled for trial with all 10 defendants in October.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the possible involvement of the Stoltzfuses made
it apparent to many within the Amish community, as well as to
outsiders, that their venerated way of life may stand apart in
superficial fashion only.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the physical appearance, alone, of Abner King Stoltzfus
in court seemed to suggest a tension between the Amish world and
beyond: He wore the traditional black pants and suspenders of an
Amish elder but a shirt that was bright blue, rather than white,
and expensive white sneakers, rather than nondescript black shoes.
Also, his hair was cut stylishly short, with sharply-angled
sideburns. Most Amish men wear their hair much longer and in no
discernible style.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people have an idealistic view of the Amish and treat
us as if we are wonderful people,'' said a 44-year-old Amish woman
named Rebecca, who manages an office in Strasburg and asked that
her last name not be used. ``I love the Amish people, but we have
our faults and our problems. It's not good for us to be looked upon
as morally great. We aren't perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dominguez, the assistant U.S. attorney who is prosecuting
the case, cautioned against broad-brushing all Amish because of the
possible actions of a few. ``The Amish have a well-deserved
reputation as hard-working, decent people,'' Dominguez said. ``This
indictment does not change that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hope Leferber, a lawyer for one of the Pagans, Douglas
Hersh, 29, predicted that the trial might at least prove Rebecca's
view correct, blurring the lines of distinction between public
perceptions of Pagans as rough-hewn thugs and of Amish as rustic
gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making the Amish out to be pristine, untarnished young
men, corrupted by the evil Pagans,'' she said. ``The truth be
known, these kids are the same as any other kids who surrender to
the temptations of youth. They weren't corrupted. At best, they
were willing participants.''

NEW YORK TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON SWISS BANKS SEPT. 1 IF NO ACCORD
REACHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moving ini`a' category) 
(JT) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officials of the City and State of New York said
Thursday that they would begin imposing sanctions on Swiss banks on
Sept. 1, hoping that the two-month ``cooling off period'' would
persuade Swiss bank officials and lawyers for Holocaust survivors
and heirs to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Barring Swiss banks from bidding on overnight deposits, which
average more than $2 billion just for the city, would be the first
step, followed in stages by barring other business, canceling
existing contracts and selling all stocks in Swiss companies.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said sanctions, last used to bring pressure
to end apartheid in South Africa, were ``unjustified, unwarranted
and counterproductive'' to reaching a quick settlement of the
claims of Holocaust survivors, whose average age is 81.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions could undermine New York's position as the financial
capital of the global economy by raising doubts about how open
American financial markets are, Under Secretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat said in an interview. He also said that he had urged the
Swiss government to ``not overreact'' to the sanctions and
retaliate with actions that could make a settlement more difficult
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Two Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, offered $600 million
last month to settle claims.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Weiss, one of the lawyers for the survivors, heirs and
charities representing heirless assets, proposed settling the case
for $1.5 billion, provided the Swiss government and the Swiss
National Bank joined in a ``global settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks collapsed after Weiss made his proposal last month.
The sanctions were announced by the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi,
and the state Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a day after a meeting in
which they said that the Swiss consul general in New York, Jacques
Reverdin, told a panel of state and local government finance
officials that the Swiss government would never contribute to a
restitution fund.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said Reverdin's statements revealed a change from the
posture the Swiss government had taken in private talks, which he
said was to signal it would ease a ``global settlement'' to resolve
all claims. These, he said, would include those against the Swiss
government and its Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said the Swiss government's position amounted to
``denying moral responsibility'' for buying stolen assets,
including gold removed from the teeth of Nazi death-camp victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``No punishment is being asked, no penalty,'' Hevesi said. ``It
is restitution we seek.''
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi pointed to a May 25 report by a panel created by the
Swiss government, known as the Bergier Commission, which concluded
that by 1942 Swiss government officials knew the gold the Nazis
sold to them was looted from Jews, a practice that was so obvious
that it could be discerned by careful readers of Swiss newspapers.
He said the report should have spurred the Swiss government to
``prepare its people'' to support a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Reverdin said that the Swiss government had been unwavering in
its position that all claims concerning assets that the Nazis stole
from Jews and then sold to the Swiss National Bank were resolved by
a 1946 agreement reached in Washington and signed by the World War
II Allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a settled matter and there is no reason to reopen
it,'' Reverdin said.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said the Swiss government had never changed its
position that it would support any settlement that the two banks
might reach, but that it was not a party to the talks and was not
obligated to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banks were paid about $31 million in investment fees by
the city in the last year, more than 10 percent of the $285 million
that the city spent on investment management, advice and broker
commissions, Steve Newman, the first deputy city comptroller,
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office could not immediately supply comparable figures.
</P>
<P>
   If all 800 state and local government finance officers were to
terminate short-term investment dealings with Swiss banks, the
annual fees would quickly total more than the $900 million
difference between the banks' offer and Weiss' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions plan calls for the city and state to begin
sanctions on Sept. 1 by barring overnight investments with Swiss
banks, new letters of credit agreements and taking part in
underwriting new state and city debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, if no settlement is reached, Hevesi and McCall will
recommend excluding Swiss companies like Scudder Kemper Investments
and SBC Warburg Dillon Read &AMP; Co. from searches for new pension
fund investment managers and barring existing managers from doing
business through Swiss companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the two officials would recommend canceling existing
investment management contracts, like a CS First Boston contract to
manage $740 million for the city pension fund. They would also ask
the Legislature and City Council to pass laws barring Swiss
companies from selling goods and services to the state and city.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on July 1, 1999, they would seek to have the $106
billion state pension fund and the $82 billion city pension fund
begin divesting their holdings in Swiss companies. The city owns
$735 million in stock in Swiss companies, including $136.7 million
in the Swiss banks, Hevesi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ Far from the center of New York's
literary hub, in a flat-topped industrial building fringed by
Florida palms and flaming pink hibiscus, is a publisher that
produces steamy books in a bouillon of chicken soup flavors.
</P>
<P>
   There is little about the publisher, Health Communications, that
is conventional except that it ladles up best sellers: three
currently on the New York Times paperback best-seller lists last
weekend, including ``Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul,'' the 17th
book in its warm, shivery and carefully formatted Chicken Soup
series of simplistic and homespun inspirational parables of love,
kindness and triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The company rarely pays author advances, loathes advertising,
binds its own books, offers a company Bikram yoga room and made one
critical business decision based on the teary emotional response of
its co-founder and president, Peter Vegso.
</P>
<P>
   Vegso recalls being so overcome by the original manuscript of
``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' that he could not continue reading.
That did not prevent him, though, from making a calculating
business judgment that has resulted in the sale of 30 million
copies of assorted Chicken Soup titles and ambitious plans to pour
out 75 versions catering to souls from country music fans to
Muslims to orthodontists.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of rare, consistent success with a title that
makes other large trade publishers misty for more practical
reasons. ``There's absolutely nothing that comes close to it in all
of the rest of publishing,'' said Laurence Kirshbaum, the chairman
of Time Warner Trade Publishing, which includes Warner Books.
``They are the dream not only of small publishers, but large
publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Health Communications are hardly literary and Vegso
is the first to concede that ``when we started in the publishing
business, we didn't know how to do it.'' So he and his partner,
Gary Seidler, did not know it was heretical to offer authors no
advances or that it was highly unusual for a publisher to own its
own a printing press _ let alone for its executives to don blue
jean and operate it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the two men headed south for Florida from their native
Canada in a Volkswagen Beetle. They had a $10,000 grant to sustain
them, along with their skills as a marketing director and a press
officer for the Addiction Resource Foundation in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to the United States to capitalize on the growth
in drug and alcohol treatment programs by starting a newspaper
aimed at the recovery movement. Eventually they bought their own
printing press to publish pamphlets and books, discovering many of
their authors through conferences that they organized for
counselors and therapists.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years that followed, the company experienced a scary
cycle of rising and falling and rising revenues that could be a
fitting parable for a Chicken Soup for the Publisher's Soul.
</P>
<P>
   Sales plunged in the early 1990s with reductions in government
spending and health-care insurance subsidies for addiction recovery
programs, according to Vegso. Suddenly there was a glut on the
market of therapy-related books as larger trade publishers entered
the field and Health Communications scrambled to keep pace by
pumping chapter-length ideas into full-scale books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a free for all,'' recalled Vegso. ``We just published
it to death.'' When its revenues, which had reached $17 million in
1990, dropped by 50 percent in 1991 to about $8.5 million and 50
percent more the following year, Health Communications laid off
employees, scaled back its schedule of conferences, and
concentrated on its backlist of steady selling perennial books.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this lull in the company's fortunes in 1992 that
Vegso and Seidler encountered two would-be authors and professional
motivational speakers, Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield. With a
rich history of rejection, Hansen and Canfield had come to the
annual convention of the American Booksellers Association in
Southern California carrying the ``Chicken Soup for the Soul''
manuscripts, dozens of uplifting tales they had written themselves
and compiled from other sources, stuffed in their backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three trade publishers had already dismissed the
manuscript, recalled Hansen, who said that essentially the various
editors believed that short stories did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   These were quirky upbeat tales offering lessons in love and
kindness: a rider thanking a cranky New York cabbie for a ``superb
ride'' in hopes that one compliment will multiply in niceness to 20
more fares; a hugging judge who revels in an embrace with a nursing
home patient who smiles for the first time in 23 years; a woman who
is certain that the heart of a mute stroke victim is beating out
the words, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We said these aren't short stories,'' said Hansen, 50, who
lives in Newport Beach, Calif. ``These are visceral stories that
touch the soul. They didn't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Communications did. ``I didn't know I was the 34th
publisher and I really didn't care,'' Vegso said. ``I said, `Sure,
let's do it.' I was in the airport reading it and I was in tears. I
had to stop because I thought people would think there was
something wrong with a grown man crying in the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   It took more than a year for the first Chicken Soup to claw its
way onto The New York Times best-seller list. Health Communications
benefited from the fact that the authors were professional speakers
and tireless promoters, who developed their own intensive marketing
system, which included the fundamental daily rule of seeking ``five
media hits,'' or interviews, with small radio stations, newspapers
and regional television shows.
</P>
<P>
   The authors also sought unconventional outlets for their books,
from bakeries and nail salons to motivational seminars and pet food
stores. They asked dozens of their friends to buy 100 books each to
sell to their friends. They persuaded Celestial Seasonings to print
sample stories on its tea boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it bypass marketing,'' said Hansen, the co-author of
the series. ``Health Communications is the publisher and the
distributor and we're going to do all the promoting and marketing.
As you know, a book usually has 30 days on the market before they
pull it off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   And for their long list of sequel books, the two authors created
a focus group of readers and friends, Hansen said, who literally
grade stories for ``goosebumpy'' buttery emotions on a scale of 1
to 10.
</P>
<P>
   These critical lessons of self-promotion are factors that Health
Communications weighs when it picks its authors, who typically are
professional speakers with established forums to promote their own
books.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It published two unlikely paperback best sellers this year, ``A
Child Called `It''' and its sequel, ``The Lost Boy,'' which are
based on the grim childhood memories of Dave Pelzer, a professional
speaker from California with a keen sense of humor who, as he puts
it, can talk in a disarming way that ``makes child abuse funny.''
</P>
<P>
   His first book _ written in a simple child's voice, but without
the lyricism of Frank McCourt's childhood chronicle ``Angela's
Ashes'' _ is a relentless description of his abuse at his late
mother's hand. Pelzer accuses her of every level of torture from
beatings to knife wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The book was first published in 1993 and initially did not sell
that well, according to Pelzer, who decided to invest his own money
in promotion by hiring several regional public relations firms and
increasing his speaking engagements, which finally culminated in a
breakthrough appearance in 1997 on ``The Montel Williams Show''
that increased sales dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Pelzer said that he was initially referred to Health
Communications by one of the Chicken Soup authors. ``They were
small and privately owned and I'm thinking that with a bigger house
I might get more money, but I might get lost in the shuffle,'' he
said. ``One of the things that impressed me is that Peter sent me a
letter welcoming me to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, Pelzer would truly make it a family, becoming
engaged to his editor from Health Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Chicken Soup and Pelzer's two titles has
obviously made a difference in Health Communication's fortunes,
increasing its revenue to $85 million last year, according to
Vegso. And like any small publisher, he is well aware that at any
time one of his larger rivals in distant New York might try to
snatch away one of his successful authors.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are a host of imitators of the Chicken Soup series
by rival publishers and knock-offs from Health Communications
itself (``Taste-Berry Tales: Stories to Lift the Spirit, Fill the
Heart and Feed the Soul,'' or ``Puppies for Sale and Other
Inspirational Tales.'')
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Vegso's partner, Seidler, decided to withdraw from
full-time work at the company to act as a consultant to Health
Communications, but Vegso said he remained content to stay at the
company, dividing his time between books and his horse breeding
farm in nearby Ocala.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning back in his office chair, he toyed with a hand-crocheted
chicken given to him by a reader while talking about why he enjoys
his job so much. His reasons are the sweet essence of Chicken Soup
parables. ``I like the fact that we help a lot of people,'' he
said. ``People will come up and say that you've saved my life.
That's nice.''

ONE DAY AN ALLEGED PAKISTAN NUCLEAR EXPERT, THE NEXT AN ALLEGED
ACCOUNTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN KIFNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A self-proclaimed defector from Pakistan's nuclear
weapons program is not a scientist at all, but a low-paid
accountant for a company that makes bathroom tiles, a director of
the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Iftikhar Khan Chaudhry, who is seeking asylum in the United
States, told a number of reporters Wednesday that he had been at an
April meeting _ weeks before India and Pakistan set off dueling
nuclear tests _ in which Pakistani military leaders decided to
launch a pre-emptive nuclear attack against New Delhi within 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Khan, at a series of news conferences at the New York office of
his lawyer, Michael Wildes, said he was ready to provide the United
States with sensitive, secret information about Pakistan's nuclear
weapons program, including the presence of Chinese and Iranian
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But Azad Gulzar Sheikh, a director of Forte Trading Co., told
Pakistan state television in Islamabad and other Pakistani news
agencies that until last fall Khan had worked as an assistant
accountant for his company, which makes ceramic tiles and bathroom
fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shocking moment for me when I read newspaper reports
about the fake story,'' Sheikh told the privately run news agency
News Network International.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh said that Khan had worked for the company between August
1993 and November 1997. He had a bachelor's degree in business
practices, Sheikh said, and made about $120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission issued a statement calling
Khan's story ``baseless, malicious, fabricated and concocted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No such scientist of any such name has ever worked in any of
the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's sensitive nuclear
installations,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Kamal, the Pakistani representative to the United Nations,
said in a telephone interview that authorities had been able to
track down Khan's identity through the correct family address on
the identification card he had produced _ which the official said
was a forgery _ and through his photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Wildes, the lawyer who had arranged Khan's many interviews, said
``we expected this kind of response from the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client has up to date, accurate and specific details on the
nuclear missile program and other intimate details concerning their
nuclear weapons,'' Wildes maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The American government appeared dubious about Khan's claims.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said Thursday that ``we
have no information to support this person's claim that Pakistan
was planning a pre-emptive strike on Indian nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we note significant discrepencies in his story, as
reported in the press,'' he added, without elaboration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking without knowledge of the latest Pakistani denials,
several experts in the area said they were troubled by a number of
details in the story told by Khan.
</P>
<P>
   These apparent contradictions led Michael Krepon, an expert in
the strained military relations between India and Pakistan, to
describe the account as ``eminently disbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Krepon, of the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, was
particularly skeptical of Khan's report that at a meeting on April
25, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, Pakistan's chief of the army general
staff, gave the go-ahead for a nuclear attack on New Delhi, after
hearing intelligence reports indicating that an Indian attack on
Pakistan's nuclear sites might be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Krepon dismissed the account, and described Karamat as a ``most
levelheaded, cautious, buttoned-down individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan asserted that Pakistan had deployed missiles with nuclear
warheads on the border, near Punch in the Kashmir region and at
Fort Abbas, roughly parallel to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pathetic,'' Krepon said. In the Punch area, he said,
the ``terrain is completely inhospitable to nuclear weapons
deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said, there was little reason for Pakistan to
deploy missiles near the border _ where they would be vulnerable to
attack _ because it now has a superior medium range missile, the
Ghauri.
</P>
<P>
   George Perkovich of the W. Allen Jones Foundation and the author
of the forthcoming book ``India's Nuclear Bomb,'' said, ``There are
a lot of things that don't add up. It makes me extremely skeptical
about this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Krepon, Perkovich was dubious about the role attributed to
Karamat, saying that ``people I respect here say he is one of the
most sober, responsible leaders Pakistan ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been similar nuclear jitters in the past, Perkovich
said, notably in 1982 and 1984, so the tensions described by Khan
were not unique. But the account seems incredible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And given the nature of Pakistani society, the very notion of a
defector from the nuclear program was unlikely, Perkovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be the first conscientious objector there ever,''
he said. ``In a society where people don't protest? A Pakistani
scientist? It doesn't make sense.'' &QL;

TRIPP WRAPS UP SECOND DAY OF TESTIMONY IN CLINTON INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon worker Linda Tripp appeared again Thursday
before a federal grand jury investigating an alleged presidential
affair and cover-up as supporters tried to counter the perception
that she betrayed Monica Lewinsky as part of a book deal,
</P>
<P>
   While Tripp, whose tapes of her telephone conversations with
Lewinsky prompted the inquiry, spent almost 6 1/2 hours with grand
jurors, her supporters tried to portray Tripp as unwittingly caught
up in the events at the heart of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the U.S. District Courthouse, Tripp ignored
questions about the effort to recast her image. Asked how she was
feeling after two days of closed-door questioning by the grand jury
and independent counsel Kenneth Starr's deputies, Tripp responded:
``Well.''
</P>
<P>
   Escorted by uniformed federal police, Tripp, her attorneys and a
spokesman swept past reporters and out of the building to a minivan
for the short ride to her the lawyers' office, then to her suburban
Maryland home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda is actually very encouraged by the quality and content
of the questions presented by the grand jurors and the
prosecutors,'' said Joe Murtha, one of her lawyers. ``If there is
any truth to the adage that an honest person's pillow is peace of
mind, I assure you that Mrs. Tripp will sleep very well tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to characterize her testimony, Murtha said it is ``so
comprehensive'' that discussing any of it ``wouldn't serve any
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said Tripp will be returning to the grand jury but
Starr's office has not indicated when.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's testimony comes in the fifth month of Starr's
investigation into whether the president or his associates tried to
cover up his alleged sexual encounters at the White House with
Lewinsky or Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, 48, a former White House secretary who was transferred to
the Pentagon, became friends there with Lewinsky, 24. Like Tripp,
Lewinsky had been transferred to the Pentagon from a job at the
White House, a full-time, paying position she was given after her
internship ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, a holdover from the Bush administration, had been
appalled by the behavior and relaxed dress around the Clinton White
House. In 1996, Tripp contacted New York publicist Luciana Goldberg
about a book deal, but it never developed. The working title was
``Behind Closed Doors: What I Saw at the Clinton White House.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Tripp again contacted Goldberg after Clinton's
lawyer, Robert Bennett, called Tripp a liar for comments she made
in Newsweek magazine about a November 1993 encounter between
Clinton and Willey near the Oval Office. Willey has testified that
the president groped her.
</P>
<P>
   When Tripp talked to Goldberg about Bennett's remark and the
tales Lewinsky was telling, Goldberg suggested taping telephone
conversations with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   During the next several weeks, Tripp compiled 20 hours of
conversations in which Lewinsky reportedly says she and the
president had an 18-month affair. The tapes have been turned over
to Starr and the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   When it became apparent that they might have to testify in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, Lewinsky
told Tripp that Clinton urged her to lie about their relationship,
according to published reports about the tapes' contents.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Jones lawsuit, Clinton and Lewinsky denied the
affair under oath. Clinton has said publicly he never asked anyone
to lie.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, Tripp's defenders say, include her warning to
Lewinsky that she planned to respond truthfully when questioned by
Jones' lawyers. In one conversation, Tripp reportedly urges
Lewinsky to tell the truth and encourages her to caution the
president not to lie when questioned by Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Citing e-mail messages Tripp sent to Lewinsky in late 1997, one
unnamed source quoted by The Associated Press said that Tripp tried
to end her friendship with Lewinsky last fall, about three months
before the investigation began. Those e-mail messages, the unnamed
source told AP, indicate that she tried several times to get
Lewinsky to stop calling and visiting to discuss Clinton and their
alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please give me a break; I can't take this,'' Tripp wrote in an
e-mail letter to Lewinsky on Oct. 27, 1997, the source told AP. On
Nov. 24, another e-mail to Lewinsky from Tripp said: ``The
information alone is a heavy burden, one I did not ask for.'' Tripp
spokesman Philip Coughter confirmed the content of the messages,
which have been turned over to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to burnish Tripp's image is designed to counter the
findings of recent polls, which show the public holding unfavorable
views of the career government worker.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-Time poll released Thursday shows 52 percent of Americans
have an unfavorable view of Tripp while 12 percent view her
favorably. The rest do not recognize her name.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the survey of 1,024 adults conducted June
30-July 1, found that Tripp's image was not as tarnished as
Lewinsky's. Sixty-nine percent of those polled had an unfavorable
opinion of the former intern; 12 percent viewed her favorably.

<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Clinton arrived in Hong Kong, the heart of
free-market China, Thursday evening and pledged that the United
States would do its part to lift Asia out of its economic quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that the United States considers Hong Kong
vital to the future,'' said Clinton at a banquet hosted by the
chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa. ``This present
financial crisis, too, will pass, if we work together with
discipline and vision to lift the fortunes of our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Hong Kong, the first by a sitting U.S.
president, came one day after the former British colony marked the
first anniversary of its return to China. And it gives him the
opportunity to assess one of the grander experiments in modern
political history: China's pledge to let Hong Kong remain a
capitalist enclave in the world's last communist empire.
</P>
<P>
   These days, economics are overshadowing politics here. Hong Kong
is suffering badly from the Asian financial contagion, and Clinton
will make the Asian economy the centerpiece of a major speech
Friday, in which he is expected to offer a more detailed analysis
of the region's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hong Kong is a world symbol of trade, enterprise, freedom, and
global interdependence,'' said Clinton, who looked weary despite
having relaxed earlier in the day on a two-hour boat trip on the Li
River near Guilin, in south China. He used the visit to Guilin to
discuss China's dire environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   After flying here he praised Hong Kong and China for being
anchors of stability in a region-wide economic storm _ a reference
to the fact that neither government has devalued its currency,
despite the continued weakness of the Japanese yen and a wave of
tit-for-tat devaluations across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, a shipping magnate appointed by Beijing shortly before the
handover, welcomed the president's show of support, saying that
``what started as a regional crisis has taken on a global
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met privately with Tung for 20 minutes before the
banquet, during which they discussed the economy, according to
White House spokesman Mike McCurry. But he said Clinton also
pressed Tung to accelerate the introduction of democracy to Hong
Kong by allowing voters to elect a larger percentage of legislators
directly.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, who long lived in the West, is not known as a champion of
democracy. In his remarks at the banquet, he pointedly reminded
Clinton that Hong Kong was a Chinese city. ``The fact is, we are
Chinese and were brought up in Chinese tradition and values,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton will be able to sample the new Hong Kong _ with
a hectic series of meetings and appearances that will bring him in
contact with newly-elected politicians, both friendly and hostile
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   James Steinberg, the deputy assistant to the president for
national security affairs, said the Clinton administration wanted
to demonstrate that the United States ``continues to be active and
involved and concerned about preserving Hong Kong's autonomy and
strengthening democracy there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House has landed in a minor tempest over a meeting
with Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy leader, Martin Lee.
Clinton is scheduled to meet alone with Lee on Friday, a move
likely to displease Beijing. But the White House has barred press
coverage of the meeting, except for a photographer, and will issue
no public statements afterward, upsetting Lee and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the restrictions were ``normal practice'' when
Clinton meets with opposition leaders. Lee's aides said the White
House was seeking to assuage the Chinese, and had originally balked
at a one-on-one meeting, even though Lee has met Clinton before in
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the White House may have ended up irking both sides.
Lee said he found the decision ``very odd, because it seems to me
that President Clinton's whole visit to China has been televised.
Why does he stop with me?''
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, Clinton will sit down with a group of Hong
Kong leaders, including Lee and three other popularly-elected
legislators. Among them will be Tsang Yok-sing, a former high
school principal and avowed Marxist who heads the main pro-Beijing
party in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The president will also meet with senior civil servants, and the
head of Hong Kong's government-owned broadcasting outlet, Radio
Television Hong Kong, Cheung Man-yee. RTHK has been harshly
criticized by pro-Beijing people here for undermining the local
government and being disloyal to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was among the first passengers to land at Hong Kong's
new $20 billion airport _ touching down 10 hours after Chinese
President Jiang Zemin dedicated the vast complex _ and became its
first departing passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Like some Hong Kong residents, though, Clinton expressed
nostalgia for the old airport, Kai Tak, which was famous for the
rooftop-skimming approaches made by planes as they landed. Clinton,
who sat in the cockpit of a plane as it landed at Kai Tak on a
visit to Hong Kong more than a decade ago, said, ``It was one of
the most exciting and uncertain experiences of my life-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before flying to Hong Kong Thursday night, Clinton spoke on the
environmental hazards confronting China.
</P>
<P>
   With the spectacular limestone peaks of the southern city of
Guilin as a backdrop, Clinton said that 5 of the world's 10 most
polluted cities are in China and virtually every body of water in
the country is tainted with human and industrial waste. But, he
said, China did not have to sacrifice its environment to continue
to build its economy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He urged China to build more energy-efficient cars, homes and
factories. The alternative, he said, was further environmental
degradation and ultimately, slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The president, addressing a small, carefully-screened audience
at a park in Guilin, one of China's most popular tourist
destinations, said that not long ago U.S. cities were choked with
smog and many of its urban waterways were seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's extraordinary growth has put the same kind of pressure
on your environment, and the costs of growth are rising right along
with your prosperity,'' the president said. ``You know better than
I that polluted air and water are threatening your remarkable
progress. Smog has caused entire Chinese cities to disappear from
satellite photographs. And respiratory illness is China's No. 1
health problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that China can take immediate steps to slow the
environmental damage. ``We can use clean, as opposed to dirty,
energy sources much more than we do; and we can adopt new
technologies to make the energy we have go further much more than
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   China and other developing countries have resisted wealthy
nations' demands to reduce emissions of gases that contribute to
global warming, complaining that the developed countries were
trying to retard the Third World's growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that China did not have to follow the path of
Europe and the United States, where growth has been fueled by
cheap, dirty and inefficient sources of energy.
</P>
<P>
   To help China address its environmental problems, Clinton
announced a $50 million Export-Import Bank loan to pay for clean
energy projects, a contract to develop methane gas from coal fields
and U.S. assistance in promoting renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing and Washington this week signed an agreement to develop
an air-quality monitoring network for China's major cities. China
will buy American-made monitoring equipment, while the United
States will provide technical aid and training to operate the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
their daughter, Chelsea, took a two-hour Li River boat ride among
the steep peaks of the Guilin region. Occasionally splattered by
rain, they passed tangerine orchards and rice fields before
arriving at the village of Yangshuo. They then boarded their
motorcade and departed for the airport and Hong Kong.

 &HT;    Mosquitoes, other pests carry disease, CDC warning
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When you go outside this weekend, be sure to stop for
bug spray.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, 286 people _ three of them in Georgia _
have contracted serious cases of encephalitis from mosquito bites,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight bite victims died in 1996 and 1997 from three types of
encephalitis, a dangerous swelling of the brain, carried by
mosquitoes. The first 1998 death, Harry Marsocci, 44, of West
Warwick, R.I., who died June 21, has just been reported, the CDC
added. No deaths were in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In its weekly national roundup of diseases, the CDC said 19
states including Georgia have reported a serious problem with
arboviruses, disease organisms carried by mosquitoes or ticks and
transmitted to humans in a multi-step cycle that includes birds and
other animals. The viruses cause 150 to 3,000 cases per year of
three unusual and potentially fatal diseases: La Crosse
encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and eastern equine
encephalitis, which caused the three Georgia cases in 1997 and
killed the Rhode Island man.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the human cases, 23 states including Georgia have
recorded arbovirus infection in animals _ chiefly horses and emus,
a flightless bird farmed for meat _ that can potentially be passed
to humans by mosquitoes. Georgia saw 16 cases of eastern equine
encephalitis in horses in 1996 and 1997, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Because arbovirus infection can have such serious results,
health professionals should consider it as a possible diagnosis
when treating cases of fever, muscle aches and nausea, meningitis
or encephalitis from mosquito-prone areas, the CDC said. And
residents in such areas should take particular precautions,
including wearing long sleeves and long pants outdoors after dark,
using insect repellent and properly screening doors and windows
against bugs.

 &HT;    CNN issues a retraction and apology for Operation Tailwind's
story
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Three executives have left CNN after an independent
investigation found the cable news network's report of alleged U.S.
use of nerve gas was ``journalistic overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN Newsgroup CEO Tom Johnson rectracted the story and
apologized to viewers and the military personnel involved in
Operation Tailwind, a 1970 mission into Laos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story shouldn't have been on,'' said attorney Floyd
Abrams, who was hired by Johnson to investigate after people
involved challenged the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone from top to bottom bears a level of responsibility,''
Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN's system of journalistic checks and balances, which has
served us exceptionally well in the past, failed in this case,''
Johnson said in a statement Thursday that was read repeatedly on
CNN and posted on its web page.
</P>
<P>
   April Oliver, the producer of the report that aired June 7 on
``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' reportedly was fired Thursday. Pam Hill,
senior executive producer of the newsmagazine, resigned, and Jack
Smith, senior producer, left the network under unclear
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Arnett, the on-air reporter of the story, was reprimanded,
although it was not clear how much of a contribution he had made to
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Greenfield, co-anchor of ``CNN &AMP; Time,'' said the 10 p.m.
Sunday show will air a ``full and lengthy presentation of the fact
that we screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we're going to hold ourselves to the same standard
that we hold everyone else,'' Greenfield said Thursday. ``That's
going to happen. There will be no attempt to spin, no attempt to be
defensive or political about this.'' Assistant Secertary of Defense
Kenneth Bacon said Thursday the Pentagon was ``gratified that CNN
retracted a report that we believe was not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine, which ran a print version of the story written by
Oliver and Arnett, also apologized Thursday.

 &HT;    Web sites offer fast updates, insight, photos
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Internet offers a variety of news and dramatic
pictures on video documenting the fires burning out of control in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Web sites covering the fires are showing thoughtful
restraint, offering news and emergency information first and saving
the dramatic pictures for farther down on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   The local Web sites covering the fires also are making extensive
use of streaming video to chronicle the disaster, making expert use
of a technology that wasn't in wide use a year or even six months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   For example, The Daytona Beach News-Journal
(http://www.n-jcenter.com) has extensive coverage of the fires on a
simple, picture-free start page that includes breaking news
coverage and emergency information. The news package runs under the
title ``Central Florida in Flames'' and includes evacuation
information, a photo tour and editorials.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Sentinel (http://www.orlandosentinel.com) also has
news and information in a special section visitors can link to from
the front page. The Sentinel offers dramatic pictures of the
devastation and offers emergency phone numbers and volunteer and
donation addresses and phone numbers. The Sentinel makes use of
graphics and QuickTime video to explain how firefighters battle the
flames and record astonishing photos of the fires. The Sentinel is
continually updating its Web site with breaking news and
information.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Volusia County also has a Web site devoted to wildfire
updates at http://www.volusia.org/firenews.htm. The site offers
information and a special visitor's section. ``We're happy you're
here, and we hope you enjoy your stay,'' begins the tips page
asking visitors to obey certain fire safety and prevention rules.
The site also has a map of the stricken areas and lists of road
closings.
</P>
<P>
   For road closure updates and county-by-county trouble spots in
Central Florida, check out Inside Central Florida
(http://insidecentralflorida.com), a Cox Interactive Media site in
partnership with several local radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has many sites devoted to the science and
management of the fires. But the most fascinating is the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(http://www.noaa.gov/floridafires.html). It offers a scientific
explanation of the abnormal weather patterns and climate conditions
that led up to the fires' outbreak. Visitors can look at
statistical information and satellite photographs of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, CNN (http://www.cnn.com) makes extensive
use of VXtreme streaming video to bring astonishingly clear fire
footage to computer desktops. The resolution is clear even on 28.8k
bps modems.
</P>
<P>
   The use of streaming video technology to tell the story of this
natural disaster is a giant step forward in Web site development
and technology, and most sites use it to good advantage.

 &HT;    Flames outpace race
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH -- The lights of Daytona International Speedway
won't shine on the July 4 Pepsi 400 as planned this weekend. Race
officials postponed Saturday's historic event early Thursday
morning because wildfires continue to plague Daytona Beach and
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions being the way they are now, we don't think there's
room for the race and the fire,'' NASCAR President Bill France Jr.
said. ``And the fire is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The race has been rescheduled for the night of Saturday, Oct.
17, three weeks before the season-ending NAPA 500 race south of
Atlanta. All Pepsi 400 tickets will be honored at that time, but
there will be no refunds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postponing this race is the right thing to do,'' Speedway
President John Graham said. ``Our manpower, facilities and
resources will remain completely devoted to our community until
this crisis is over. The fires have not directly affected the
480-acre Speedway facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The postponement was announced an hour before the gates were to
open, turning the speedway into a ghost town. Hundreds of fans in a
wide variety of vehicles who had lined up for infield vantage
points turned and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too dangerous for everybody,'' said racing fan Mark Smith
of Dalton, Ga. ``We're breathing soot and everything else right
now. There are ashes falling out here. Just imagine what it's doing
at the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR drivers and teams, scheduled to qualify Thursday night,
headed back to their race shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's like a 'snow day' at school, where you sit
there and wonder what the heck you are going to do,'' said Jeremy
Mayfield, driver of the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford. ``It's not that neat
feeling, though, because I'd be wanting to go outside and play when
I was a kid. If I have a weekend off now, I think about racing
somewhere. I'd love to be racing at Daytona Saturday night, but I
bet everybody else would be, too.''
</P>
<P>
   All 143,000 grandstand seats were sold out for the race, billed
as the largest night sports event ever. The Pepsi 400 would have
been the first night NASCAR race at Daytona International Speedway
and the first motor sports event televised by a network during
prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were forced to postpone the race after wind-driven
wildfires roared to life Wednesday afternoon and evening just north
of the speedway, forcing thousands of people in Ormond Beach and
Daytona Beach to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach and Volusia County authorities also closed roads
because of fires. A ride from the Orlando airport to the speedway,
which usually takes less than an hour, took more than three hours
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very frustrated,'' said Ralph Sheheen, chief auto
racing reporter for CBS, which was to televise the race. ``We all
had this date circled on our calendars. There was a real buzz among
fans, teams and CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The October weekend was the logical choice,'' said Mike
Helton, NASCAR's vice president for competition. ``There's two
opportunities left in the '98 season, two weeks from now, and the
next is Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like, with the level that the fire elevated itself
last night, with that intensity and level of damage it jumped to
last night, trying to get to two weeks from now was not as logical
as Oct. 17.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time a NASCAR event has been postponed because
of fire. But NASCAR has had two other memorable postponements _ a
1993 snow storm in Atlanta postponed a race at Hampton, and sand
storms in Phoenix two years ago postponed that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we would prefer to be running the race,''
France said. ``And I know everybody in town would prefer for us to
be running the race. But nobody is thinking that what's going on
out there (fire) is a better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(This is what happens) when Mother Nature or an act of God
gets into the playing picture,'' Helton said. ``We're an outdoor
sport and depend on the environment outside. It's the price we pay
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, NASCAR had announced that the race was still on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the course we were on through (Wednesday),'' Helton
said. ``But during the night, it simply took a very sharp turn and
a very quick movement to the negative side. And that changed our
whole philosophy.''

 &HT;    King of the road
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In 20 years of photographing the Great American Road,
John Margolies has come to expect the things he loves to vanish. He
returns to a town and, more often than not, the tepee motel or
wiener-shaped hot dog stand that once beckoned his camera have gone
on to that big four-lane in the sky. So imagine his delight when he
arrives in Atlanta, six years after his last visit, and sees the
same sign on the same wall at Biggar's Antiques in Chamblee. The
green tin disk advertises Tom Thumb miniature golf, a chain of
putteries that was all the rage in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a sign like that,'' says Margolies, who did an
entire book on miniature golf. ``I deserve that sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Biggar, the billy goat-bearded man behind the counter,
agrees that it's a nice sign. His price: $850.
</P>
<P>
   Margolies winces; now he remembers why he didn't buy it six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If a 68-year-old piece of scrap metal is selling for hundreds of
dollars, Margolies has no one to blame but himself. More than
perhaps anyone, he's responsible for the fact that people have come
to value the eccentricities of the American roadside even as they
disappear in the era of interstates and franchise standardization.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-'70s, Margolies has driven a hundred thousand
miles throughout the lower 48 and snapped a hundred thousand photos
of motels, storefronts, gas stations, fast-food joints and the
like. He's tapped his personal archive for nine picture books that
are as bittersweet as they are quirky and entertaining.
Preservation magazine called him ``a cartographer with the heart of
a poet and the eye of an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Just now, he has the stomach of a hungry traveler. Margolies has
flown in from New York, where he lives in an Upper West Side
apartment, to promote his latest volume, ``Fun Along the Road''
(Bulfinch Press, $29.95), an ode to old-time tourist attractions
like Florida's Gatorland Zoo and South Carolina's South of the
Border. It's lunchtime, and the man wants some real Southern
barbecue. ``We don't have hickory in Manhattan,'' he deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   So we pile into a Chevy Cavalier _ Margolies prefers to make his
trips in a roomy Cadillac _ and light out for Atlanta along the
Avenue Formerly Known as Stewart. Metropolitan Avenue (as the city
recently renamed it) is also U.S. 19-41, a main tourist route to
Florida before the interstates were built. This is the way
Margolies likes to approach a city, on its bypassed arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't photographed much in Atlanta because the prosperous
places tear things down,'' he says. ``I'm more interested in the
forgotten places, the bad side of town.''
</P>
<P>
   As we drive, his eyes dart back and forth, and he points out the
rusting archaeology of the avenue: the site of an old tourist court
(``I've got their postcard''), the converted buildings that once
housed gas stations (``That was a Texaco''), the renovated
apartments that used to be the Alamo Plaza, part of America's first
motel chain (``Terrible! They've ruined the mission facade''). It's
easy to imagine that the man in the passenger seat isn't a paunchy
58-year-old with a hairline headed for Canada, but a boy taking in
the roadside for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it started for Margolies. Growing up in
pre-interstate Connecticut, he enjoyed the family's vacation drives
to the beach as much as the beach. After studying art history and
communications at the University of Pennsylvania, he took an
editing position with Architectural Record magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1960s, the waning days of modern architecture, and
Margolies found himself more interested in the roadside memories of
his childhood than the glass boxes he was writing about. He quit
the Record and made a name for himself as curator of a
controversial 1970 exhibition on Morris Lapidus, the architect of
Miami Beach's most gloriously tacky hotels. In 1976, he hit the
road to document the simpler (but often just as tacky) buildings
that Americans had erected to seduce motorists during the first
decades of the automobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to dismiss what I do as kitsch, but I think it's
important,'' Margolies says. ``I've made a visual record of the way
free enterprise has manifested itself on the sides of the road and
Main Street.'' Besides, he likes his teapot gas stations and
swirl-topped ice cream stands better than the buildings that were
done in good taste. ``They're less pretentious, more honest, easier
to dance to.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolies would take frequent trips of 30 to 60 days, funded in
part by grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National
Endowment for the Arts and patrons such as architect Philip Johnson
(who wanted to see slide shows when he returned). The vision never
varied: Margolies took color slides designed to show structures as
timeless icons. No people, no cars, no rain _ just a building
against a blue sky, God's own postcard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed half the Super Bowl one year waiting for the clouds
to break over Mammy's Cupboard,'' he says, referring to a Natchez,
Miss., cafe tucked inside a two-story servant's enormous skirts.
</P>
<P>
   He's eaten a mountain of bad food. Drunk so much coffee and
gobbled so many aspirin that he developed an ulcer. Slept on enough
mashed potato mattresses to know that he doesn't want to stay in
the mom and pop motels he loves to photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the old two-story Holiday Inns,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Last time he was in Atlanta, Margolies spent an afternoon
shooting portraits of the Big Chicken in Marietta. Perhaps this
time he would like to see our latest larger-than-life entree, the
65-foot salmon at the Atlanta Fish Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fine fish,'' he says, admiring the finned wonder on
Pharr Road in Buckhead. So why isn't he reaching for his camera?
``It isn't as good as the Big Fish in Minnesota. I'd like it better
if it were painted some unnatural color. It's too tasteful for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolies doesn't devote much time to driving around America
these days. Most of the things that attracted his eye have either
vanished or already been added to his collection of images. He
finds it more fruitful to explore flea markets and antiques shops _
which is why, after a stop for a barbecue sandwich, we're cruising
down Antique Row in Chamblee headed back to Biggar's. It has
something he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Biggar's is cluttered is like saying that the
Smithsonian has some stuff. Located in a former Methodist church,
the rambling shop has replaced the sanctuary and Sunday school
rooms with floor-to-ceiling furniture and advertising memorabilia.
The outside walls are covered with roadside signs such as the rusty
pig from Macon's old Pig 'n' Whistle restaurant. The Tom Thumb
miniature golf sign is hanging outside the vestibule. Margolies
would like it for an exhibition he's curating next year on American
tourism at the National Building Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you come down on the price?'' he asks Biggar.
</P>
<P>
   The shopkeeper laughs. ``This person rides around taking
pictures of other people's hard work and makes a lot of money, and
he can't afford to buy a sign?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make a lot of money,'' Margolies says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't look sick to me,'' Biggar replies.
</P>
<P>
   None of his books has sold more than 30,000 copies, so maybe
Margolies can't drop $850 for every sign he takes a liking to. He
passes. Instead, he spends $66 on vintage road maps and travel
brochures that might end up in the Washington show.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the car, Margolies can't get over the rejection. ``He
annoys me with that sign,'' he mutters. There's a third visit
later, still to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only part of it: Margolies is also annoyed that some
people seem to think his life's work has consisted of being paid to
take a perpetual vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me that it must be so much fun, what I do. Well,
it's work. Hard, lonely work. When I'm on the road, almost always
by myself, I don't do the things people on vacation do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the Grand Canyon for all of 30 seconds and took three or
four pictures. I spent hours at Flintstone Bedrock City and took
six or eight rolls. When I was driving through Colorado and saw the
turnoff for the Great Sand Dunes National Monument, I didn't take
my foot off the accelerator. That wasn't what I came to see. I was
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a big, beautiful country out there beyond the roadside.
Maybe, one day, the King of the Road will see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime,'' he says, wistfully, ``I would like to go back and
see the sand dunes.''

MEDICAID PROGRAMS MUST PAY FOR VIAGRA USE, ADMINISTRATION SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis, Mich, Utah)  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration told state officials on
Thursday that their Medicaid programs must pay for medically
approved uses of Viagra, the popular but expensive new impotence
pill.
</P>
<P>
   But several states immediately objected to the federal
directive, with New York and Wisconsin saying they did not intend
to comply.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to governors on Thursday, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle,
administrator of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration,
said state Medicaid programs must cover Viagra when it is medically
necessary for treatment of male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hinckley, a spokesman for the New York State Health
Department, said: ``We disagree with what the federal government is
saying. We have a responsibility to protect the health of Medicaid
recipients. The federal government needs to get a better handle on
potential complications that can arise from use of Viagra before it
requires state Medicaid programs to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley said New York officials were concerned about Viagra's
interactions with other drugs and its effects on people with
chronic conditions including heart disease. The label for Viagra
says it should not be used by people taking organic nitrates like
nitroglycerin, which is often used to treat angina, or chest pain,
caused by clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Gov. George Pataki of New York
said on Thursday night, ``The federal government should not be
requiring New York or any other state to pay for Viagra until there
is a better understanding of the impact this drug has on
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several other states expressed similar concerns. In
Wisconsin, James Malone, a spokesman for the state's Department of
Health and Family Services, said: ``We are not covering Viagra
right now, and we don't intend to. We will resist being forced to
cover it. We don't believe that Viagra is medically necessary. This
federal directive is ill advised and ill considered.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how the disagreements will be resolved. They
could end up in court if poor people press claims for the drug.
Alternatively, the Clinton administration could try to withhold
Medicaid money from states that refuse to comply with the federal
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said last month that they would
probably require coverage of Viagra. On Thursday they issued a
formal directive requiring such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle said states could ``prevent abuse and misuse of
Viagra'' by requiring prior approval for prescriptions or by
limiting the number of refills or the number of pills in a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would monitor use of Viagra and
could halt coverage of the drug if evidence showed that it was
being misused or abused. Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services, ``is greatly concerned about the potential for
clinical or financial abuse of Viagra,'' Ms. DeParle said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association estimated that Thursday's
directive would cost federal and state agencies more than $100
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Baxendell, a health policy analyst at the association,
said there had been ``virtually no consultation with states'' to
assess the costs or implications of a nationwide mandate for
Medicaid coverage of Viagra. States pay 43 percent of Medicaid
costs, or roughly $73 billion of $170 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverage of Viagra should be a state option, not a mandate,''
the governors' association said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc., the maker of Viagra, says more than two million men
have taken the pill since it was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration on March 27. It is one of the most popular new
prescription products in history.
</P>
<P>
   Mariann Caprino, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said the company had
requested Medicaid coverage in all states. As of early June, she
said, 26 states covered Viagra, often with some restrictions. The
other states did not cover it or were considering whether to do so,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale price of Viagra is $7 a pill, Ms. Caprino said,
while the retail price at pharmacies ranges from $8 to $10 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caprino praised the Clinton administration's decision. Male
impotence ``is a bona fide medical condition that has a tremendous
impact on patients and their partners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But disability rights advocates expressed outrage that the
government was requiring coverage of Viagra while allowing states
to deny or cut back coverage of medical equipment needed by people
with severe disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Toubman, a lawyer at the New Haven Legal Assistance
Association, in New Haven, Conn., said, ``It's very disturbing that
the White House would instruct states that they must cover this sex
pill while allowing states to ration care for quadriplegics and
people with cerebral palsy or Lou Gehrig's disease who need special
medical equipment to keep them alive and to stay out of nursing
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle predicted that a relatively small number of Medicaid
recipients would qualify for Viagra. Women and children account for
90 percent of the 40 million Medicaid beneficiaries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years, the federal government has required states to cover
``family-planning services and supplies,'' widely understood to
include birth control pills and other contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Geralyn Lasher, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of
Community Health, said: ``We are very disappointed with today's
announcement from Washington. We are still looking at our options,
to see if we have to cover Viagra. We estimate that it would cost
us $14 million a year _ $14 million that we could spend on maternal
and infant services or people with HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, Michael Deily, the state Medicaid director, said
Thursday's announcement was ``not a surprise but certainly a
disappointment.'' He said that Utah initially allowed 10 Viagra
pills a month for Medicaid recipients, then reduced the allowance
to five pills and was now considering ``more stringent criteria''
for evaluating a patient's medical need for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, states do not have to cover prescription drugs
under Medicaid, but all states do so. Federal officials said that
if a state included prescription drugs in its Medicaid program,
then it must cover all medically accepted uses of FDA-approved
drugs manufactured by companies that agree to give discounts, or
rebates, to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Medicaid law says states may deny payment for a few
drugs, including those used for cosmetic purposes and those used to
promote fertility, to treat anorexia or to achieve weight loss.
But, Ms. DeParle said, Viagra does not meet the criteria for any of
these exceptions.

THREE VETERANS HELD WITHOUT BOND IN BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CASE IN
TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Pa.) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Three Texas military veterans were jailed
without bond Thursday after federal prosecutors accused them of
threatening to use biological weapons against the directors of the
IRS and FBI, among other federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate John Black, although conceding the evidence
presented by the government was ``sparse,'' ruled the threat was
serious enough to warrant the men's continued detention. He also
left sealed the government's affidavit and search warrants in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, federal marshals chained Jack Abbott Grebe
Jr., 43, Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, and Johnnie Wise, 72, and led them
from the courthouse to the Cameron County Jail. They are charged
with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   During the brief detention hearing, prosecutors called no
witnesses to support their contention the men posed a danger to the
community, nor did they say whether the men actually possessed any
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, federal and local authorities arrested
the suspects at Wise's dilapidated trailer in Olmito, a small
community just north of Brownsville in south Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hazardous materials disposal teams removed several containers of
chemicals found behind Wise's home, but Felix Recio, a federal
public defender who is representing Emigh, told the court that they
did not contain dangerous substances.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Rick Lara told the court the men sent a
threatening electronic message over the Internet on June 26 to
federal officials and to local and state government offices. He
said along with composing the e-mail threat, the men discussed
delivery systems for the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Lara named Emigh as the author of the e-mail, but would not say
exactly what the threats said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth television station KXAS reported Thursday night that
threatening e-mail sent to President Clinton also may have been
traced to the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed attorneys representing the three complained they
had no way to determine the roles their clients allegedly played in
the conspiracy. All three men were honorably discharged from
various branches of the military and have no prior criminal
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is sealed, your honor. Our hands are tied,'' Recio
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even own a gun, much less a weapon of mass
destruction,'' said Wise's lawyer, Keith Uhles. He added that his
client is a Navy veteran who was honorably discharged after serving
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Uhles said he had no idea of the seriousness
of the threats allegedly made by his client and his two
co-defendants. ``I don't know what they have. They won't even show
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of friends and relatives of the men attended Thursday's
hearing, including Wise's longtime friend Fred Foote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a bunch of BS,'' said Foote, a La Feria
resident who said he has known Wise for 26 years and characterized
him ``as a really nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well-read on nearly everything. If you want to make
Scotch whiskey, he'll say `here's what the ingredients are,'''
Foote said of his friend. ``But he knows as much about bombs as you
and I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Grebe's lawyer, Dan Herink, told the court his client is a
Pennsylvania native and a single parent who raised daughters by
himself and had no prior criminal record. Herink asked the court if
the federal criminal justice system had reached the point where a
person could be jailed by the government for saying something, but
then the government was not required to tell the defendant's lawyer
what it was he allegedly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I checked, we had a right to free speech in this
country,'' Herink said.
</P>
<P>
   While defense attorneys argued unsuccessfully to unseal the
documents, Recio did succeed in convincing the judge to impose a
gag order in the case, citing intense media interest.

JAPAN ANNOUNCES PLAN TO DEAL WITH BANKS' BAD DEBTS AND SPUR
ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps/mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The government announced a long-awaited plan Thursday to
clear away the nation's pile of bad debt in hopes of bolstering
global confidence in Japan and setting its economy, the world's
second largest, on track for growth.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Total Plan,'' which still needs to be approved by
Parliament, amounts to a program for dealing with $550 billion in
uncollectable loans held by Japan's largest banks. The plan's
centerpiece is a mechanism to allow banks to fail without provoking
chaos in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The government would shut insolvent institutions and turn over
their clients to government-run ``bridge banks'' to maintain a
supply of credit. It would also accelerate sales of depressed real
estate held as collateral for bad loans. Shaky companies would
close down, thousands of people could be put out of work and
bankers could be prosecuted for malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Hikaru Matsunaga, the finance minister, announced that the
government was embracing the plan shortly after it was approved
Thursday by a task force. Markets reacted cautiously to the
announcement, which had been widely anticipated, while foreign
governments urged that it be followed up with strong measures to
put it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   There has been growing apprehension that the Japanese banking
crisis may threaten economies in the West and the long boom on Wall
Street. And President Clinton and other American officials have
been stepping up the pressure lately on the Japanese. In
Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a
statement that the plan contains ``potentially significant steps,''
but he stressed that ``what is important is for the Japanese
authorities to move quickly to translate this approach into
concrete actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry officials said the government would submit
implementing legislation to Parliament at a special session in late
July. Parliamentary approval is expected.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, analysts warned that because the plan would bring
about a great deal of pain, Japan's leaders face enormous obstacles
in carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a great deal of will to clean the bad debt out
of the private sector, and I think the politicians are committed to
that, but I'm not sure the politicians are willing to restructure
the financial sector and restructure the economy,'' said John
Neuffer, a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute in
Tokyo. ``They are wonderful when it comes to passing around the
pork, but much less willing to pass around the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks, which has soared over
the last seven days on expectations of the plan and in anticipation
of tax cuts, rose again Thursday, though it lost some of its gains
in the afternoon as details of the plan were reported. The Nikkei
finished up 108.69 points, or sixth-tenths of a percent, at
16,471.58. Currency markets also showed hesitancy, weakening the
yen to 140.34 to the dollar from 139.17 in early London trading,
just as Japan's finance minister, Hikaru Matsunaga, was outlining
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   An outline of the plan, which is expected to be approved by
Parliament in late July or early August, was unveiled by Matsunaga
and other government and regulatory officials. They insisted that
Japan would move toward a market-based economy and pull away from
the convoy system in which all the banks support one another and
move ahead only as quickly as the slowest bank. Masaharu Hino, head
of the new Financial Supervision Agency, suggested that the
government would allow more banks to fail. He said the agency would
take ``strict measures'' after it inspected the nation's 19 largest
banks over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will recover confidence in the Japanese financial system by
severing ties with the past convoy administration and shifting to
an administration of severe policing, based on clear rules,'' Hino
said. ``That is the main road toward the rebirth of the financial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring is needed because Japanese banks, especially
the big banks, carry far more bad debt than their American
counterparts. Bad loans as a percentage of equity run from 90
percent at Sanwa Bank to 371 percent at Nippon Credit Bank, while
the average for the 22 largest banks in the United States at the
height of the savings-and-loan crisis was 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials used the English words ``Total Plan'' to describe the
restructuring proposal, perhaps because they sound bolder and more
innovative than the equivalent Japanese terms. The effort appears
to be modeled on the U.S. efforts to clean up the savings-and-loan
crisis of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's centerpiece is a mechanism to allow banks to fail
without provoking chaos in the financial system. Using a two-stage
``bridge bank,'' the plan will first put collapsed banks under
government administration, protecting credit-worthy borrowers left
in the lurch by the failed bank, while a merger partner is sought.
Then the collapsed bank either will be acquired or will be
nationalized with public money, sending the bad debts to an agency
established to collect bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the bridge bank approach is that it insures
that corporate customers of a failed bank will continue to have
access to loans, reducing the shock of a bank failure. The
disadvantage is that it raises questions about whether Japan, which
has overcapacity in its financial system, is truly willing to let
banks fail and whether the bridge bank system is simply one more
way of allowing insolvent institutions to founder a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, public money will be drawn from the $213 billion
bailout fund set up in March at Deposit Insurance Corp., which will
set up the bridge banks as subsidiaries of a new holding company.
The corporation will then try to transfer the business to a healthy
bank within two years, though that could be extended to five years.
The total cost of the bailout is by no means clear.
</P>
<P>
   One sticky point is how the distinction between good and bad
borrowers will be made and whether bad borrowers will be rescued
along with the good ones. Naturally, any client of a failed bank
will insist that it is a good borrower and should continue to
receive loans.

</P>
<P>
   Japan is designing a mechanism that appears similar to the
former Resolution Trust Corp. in the United States, which disposed
of bad debts during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. In
Japan, the Financial Supervisory Agency, which last month split off
about 400 people from the Finance Ministry to inspect the banks,
will be given wide authority to direct the process.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the blueprint, however, say the Total Plan does not
address some of the fundamental rigidities of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Total Plan at all,'' said Chiaki Nishiyama, an
economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, who is
now in Tokyo. ``It's a very deceiving term.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plan successfully purges the banks of their bad
loans, a broad restructuring and deregulation of industry is still
necessary to bring about a strong economic revival. One difference
between the American experience and Japan's situation is that the
United States embarked on the painful reworking of the
savings-and-loans industry just as the economy was picking up. In
contrast, Japan is beginning its plan as it sinks into a recession,
and it already is spending $120 billion in fiscal expansion to
bolster economic output.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might get a mild recovery out of this, but it will not be
impressive,'' said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities
Japan. ``If there's a promise of a deregulatory effort, they can
use fiscal expansion as a down payment. But a fiscal down payment
by itself, without restructuring, is a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, however, are a little bit more hopeful.
Resolving the bad debt is the first step toward improving the
economy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we have to solve the confidence crisis, and solving the
bad loans is a starting point,'' said Heizo Takenaka, an economics
professor at Keio University. Then, he added, Japan can ``promote a
deregulated, more transparent open-market system.''

SHORTAGE OF POPULAR MODELS WORRIES GM DEALERS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYLVANIA, Ohio _ Ask David White Jr., a Chevrolet dealer here,
how long he can last during the current General Motors strikes
without running out of vehicles, and his initial response is full
of confidence: two months, because he has about 220 new cars and
trucks in stock and typically sells 110 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But ask about supplies of specific models, and the confidence
fades to dismay. There are lots of slow-selling Lumina and Prism
sedans, plenty of Astro full-size vans and enough tiny Metro
economy cars for at least six months of sales. By contrast, he
expects to sell the last of his high-profit Tahoe and Suburban
sport utility vehicles and S-10 pickups this weekend, with no
prospect of further deliveries until early August even if the
strikes end quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at your hot products, you're at zero,'' said White,
holding out the thumb and forefinger of each hand to form little
zeros for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of popular models at dealerships now lies at the
heart of the troubles facing GM, the world's largest auto maker.
Showdowns with the United Automobile Workers are always costly for
auto makers, but GM came into the current strikes with extremely
low inventories of its most profitable vehicles, and the strikes
are obviously making it worse.
</P>
<P>
   So as customers head to showrooms this weekend for the
traditionally busy Fourth of July auto sales, they are likely to
find the most popular GM models in short supply, with few
combinations of color and options available. Discounts are
evaporating, pushing up the prices that car buyers actually pay.
And dealers for Ford, Chrysler and foreign auto makers are trying
to woo GM customers by offering wider selections, but seldom at
lower prices. Even used car prices are climbing, as dealers flock
to auctions, desperate to buy late-model cars to keep their lots
from looking empty.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a price war this spring, GM had been offering $500 to
$1,000 discount coupons on even its most popular models but allowed
these to expire on Tuesday night. Chrysler officials have already
indicated that their similar coupons will expire on Monday, and
Ford is likely to terminate its coupon program on Tuesday. Auction
prices for used 1996, 1997 and 1998 cars have already risen by
hundreds of dollars, with the few used 1998 models on the market
now selling for close to the original sticker price even though
they have a few thousand miles on them.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes at two GM auto parts factories in Flint, Mich., have
forced GM to close 26 of its 29 North American assembly plants, so
customers who want to order a precise combination of paint color
and options from the factory face months of delay _ or must
compromise and pick from dealers' dwindling selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what you get,'' said Jim Yark, an Oldsmobile
dealer in nearby Toledo, as he surveyed the 78 new cars and light
trucks on his lot _ less than a third of his usual supply, and only
enough for another three weeks of sales, he calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Many GM dealers also have franchises for other auto makers, and
are using their Ford, Dodge and other dealerships to woo customers
unable to find the right GM car or truck. The Burdick Cos., a chain
of 18 dealerships in central New York state, including a Buick
dealership, has culled from state auto registration records a list
of all nearby owners of GM full-size sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks and plans to mail them brochures offering big Dodge
Durango sport utility vehicles and Dodge Ram pickup trucks instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to hit at the weakness,'' said Louis Bregou,
the group's director of operations, while acknowledging that the
aggressive strategy could produce a shortage later this summer of
the popular Dodge light trucks. ``We could be out of Durangos and
Ram trucks by Labor Day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The strikes come at a time of record sales for GM which
announced June results by model Thursday: sales of each of its
full-size sport utility vehicle models were the highest ever in
June, and its overall light truck sales have set industry records
for the last four consecutive months. The record sales have helped
GM clear out 1998 models before the 1999 models are introduced,
which traditionally happens in late September, but GM has been too
successful for its own good. Now the auto maker finds itself
running out of popular models even as the economy is booming,
unemployment is low and people are buying lots of light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   With experience gained from more than a dozen other GM strikes
over the last five years, Wall Street analysts thought they could
estimate with confidence the company's losses from work stoppages
and put the damage to GM's after-tax earnings in the second quarter
at up to $1 billion. But GM said on Tuesday that its actual losses
were $1.18 billion, nearly 20 percent higher than Wall Street's
highest estimates, mainly because sales of light trucks had dropped
especially fast.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald L. Zarrella, GM's group vice president for marketing,
tried to reassure Wall Street and vehicle shoppers on Wednesday
that GM dealers still had ample inventories. GM has canceled
low-profit sales to car rental companies and other fleets, and its
dealerships' remaining inventories of cars and light trucks are
equal to 70 days of retail sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But such figures mask wide differences in the availability of
particular models, as well as big gaps among dealerships. Small
cars, on which GM loses money, are still plentiful, but full-size
sport utility vehicles, on which GM makes up to $10,000 apiece, are
extremely scarce. At the same time, some dealerships that started
the summer with unusually large inventories are less worried than
dealerships that tried to match up orders and sales more closely
and now find themselves with little to sell.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, dealers sell scarce models to one another at
close to invoice prices. But this informal system has broken down
now, with dealers nationwide saying in interviews this week that
they are hoarding their remaining vehicles and generally selling
only to retail customers who pay close to the full sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   The uneven distribution of vehicles poses a problem for GM
because customer loyalty to dealerships has been its greatest
strength. More than any other domestic or foreign auto maker, GM
relies on sales to previous owners of GM vehicles, a legacy of the
days in the 1960s and '70s when GM controlled half the market. Very
few owners of foreign cars, or even owners of other domestic
brands, tend to switch to GM, which is one reason why its market
share has been slowly diminishing for a quarter of a century. But
now some of those loyal GM customers are coming into dealerships
that offer an increasingly limited selection.
</P>
<P>
   Drive up and down Central Avenue in nearby Toledo, the main
street for auto dealerships, and at first glance nothing is wrong.
But on closer inspection, some of the dealerships are suffering.
Yark Oldsmobile has even resorted to one of the oldest tricks in
the dealer business: parking its remaining cars and trucks with
wider spaces between them, so as to reduce the amount of empty
asphalt visible from the road.

EX-SENATOR'S STAR RISES AS U.S. ENVOY TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (See also: CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-REPUBS, CHINA-NOTEBOOK) 
(bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Apart from Bill Clinton, who has clearly been having a
ball, possibly no one has taken greater satisfaction in the
presidential visit to China than the U.S. ambassador to Beijing,
Jim Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   The new warmth in U.S.-Chinese relations is in part a personal
victory for Sasser, 61, who came to China in early 1996 as a very
political appointee after the 1994 loss of his seat as a Democratic
senator from Tennessee, and at a time when China and the United
States were all but hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Big nations don't dance unless the geopolitical stars are
correctly aligned, but by all accounts Sasser personified the U.S.
effort to create friendlier ties despite the deep differences over
issues like human rights. His Southern style _ polite, charming and
attentive _ was an evident hit with President Jiang Zemin, who also
valued his closeness to his old Tennessee colleague, Vice President
Al Gore, in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on Wednesday in Shanghai, where he was accompanying the
president, Sasser tried not to boast about the public relations
coups for the president here.
</P>
<P>
   It was up to his wife, Mary, to reveal their elation. ``Wow!''
she had said as she answered the phone. ``It's just going great!''
</P>
<P>
   Sasser is widely rumored to be leaving his post later this year
to help Gore _ ``social and political friends'' is how Sasser
describes the long relationship _ run for president.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sasser was coy, saying, ``The normal term is about
three years, and I've been here two and a half.'' He added that he
hopes to usher Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When Sasser first arrived in Beijing, he was criticized by some
as a non-expert and relations between the two countries were
plummeting. Shortly after he had taken up his post, the Chinese
fired off missiles near Taiwan and the United States sent aircraft
carriers to the region.
</P>
<P>
   That hint of conflict proved to be a catalyst for both countries
to seek a better way of communicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very much the right man for the time,'' said William
McCahill, the deputy chief of mission here and a professional
diplomat. ``Nobody else here can pick up the phone to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jiang's visit to the United States last fall, which the
Chinese saw as a huge success, Sasser immediately pressed the White
House to move up Clinton's reciprocal trip from the originally
scheduled time next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the prickliness of this relationship, I felt that to
wait a whole year was risky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though some privately concede that the achievements of
this summit meeting have been more atmospheric than substantive,
senior foreign policy officials say they are glad the president
followed Sasser's instincts.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official also said that Sasser's easy
personal ties with Jiang and other top leaders here over the last
two years have been a great asset, although the basic outlines of
policy have been firmly drawn in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser is clearly proud of his relations with the Chinese
president, noting that he and his wife have been invited twice for
personal dinners with Jiang and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the training I had as a senator was just perfect for
this job in many ways,'' Sasser said, citing his skills gained as a
conciliator and his familiarity with the U.S. political system.
</P>
<P>
   In his successful 1994 campaign to unseat Sasser, Republican
Bill Frist charged that Sasser would be ``the official water boy to
Bill Clinton.'' Now, Sasser and Clinton, in their determination to
build friendlier ties with China, are sometimes criticized as
spending too much time carrying water for China, trying to minimize
the differences on human rights and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser asks the critics in return _ he isn't the sort to openly
bristle _ ``What is the alternative to a policy of dialogue and
engagement?'' The number one priority, he said, has to be working
out a security arrangement so that the two countries ``don't get on
a collision course militarily.'' He said he in no way minimizes the
disputes that remain.
</P>
<P>
   David Lampton, the director of China studies at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said that Sasser
has been ``remarkably successful.'' He added _ meaning this as a
compliment _ that ``his real strength has been to serve as China's
ambassador to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting more legislators to visit China and see its changes and
diversity has been a prime State Department goal; close to 100
members of congressman have visited in the last year. This not only
better acquaints them with China, but also shows their Chinese
hosts that concerns like human rights and religious tolerance are
genuinely felt on the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange has made for amusing moments, Sasser recalled, as
at a luncheon when one member of Congress asked a Chinese deputy
foreign minister _ like all senior officials here a Communist _ if
he had accepted Jesus Christ as his personal savior. ``I haven't,''
the startled official replied.
</P>
<P>
   A personal high point, Sasser said, was when he was told last
fall that the Chinese were releasing Wei Jingsheng, the prominent
dissident who had spent most of the last 20 years in jail, to exile
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese insisted on secrecy, so for Wei's release, and later
that of the student leader Wang Dan, the ambassador sneaked into a
building in the back of the Beijing airport to interview them
before they boarded their planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are high moments, when you see those guys get on an
airplane for the United States, after spending so many years in
prison,'' he recalled.

CLINTON IN CHINA: SCRIPTED EVENTS, IMMORTALITY AND SOUVENIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-REPUBS, CHINA-SASSER) 
(bl) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ As President Clinton traveled through China, his
permanent campaign rolled on.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai on Wednesday, for example, the president spoke at a
Chamber of Commerce breakfast, chatted with students at a
cybercafe, shmoozed with traders on the floor of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, hyped home ownership to residents of a new apartment
complex and sat for an interview with Chinese state television.
Pretty much like any other day on the road in America.
</P>
<P>
   Like all presidential events at home, these were heavily
scripted. At the Internet cafe on Huai Hai Road, Clinton asked a
student, Hu Danqing, to call up the home page (www.whitehouse.gov)
for the White House. Surprise! Up popped pictures of the president
in China and the words, ``Welcome Home Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent lunch with a group of carefully selected young
entrepreneurs. The president was in full earnest-listener mode,
hearing descriptions of the frustrations of start-up businesses,
which sounded very much the same as the problems that independent
business people encounter at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jin Hui Gardens complex, Clinton told residents that he
had bought his first home in Little Rock after driving by the house
with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I said to my girlfriend, `I bought that house you
like, now you'll have to marry me,''' the president said. ``And she
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriend has since been promoted to first lady.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the president did work a rope line after his remarks.
Just like back home.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Misses Real Life  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton broke away from the president on several
occasions during their trip to attend events of her own _ a
conversation with Chinese women at a Beijing hotel, a visit to the
Beijing University women's legal services center, a tour of a
Shanghai hospital and a speech at a Shanghai girls' school.
</P>
<P>
   She received universally favorable coverage, but she still
couldn't resist a dig at the press for its past sins back home.
</P>
<P>
   During a round-table discussion in Shanghai on Tuesday, she was
asked whether the constant scrutiny bothered her or limited her
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady took a home-run swing at the questioner's
softball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often refer to my life before the White House as when I was
a real person,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ``because when you are in a
position like this, people, particularly all of these people with
their pencils and their cameras, try to record everything you do
and then they try to put meaning into it _ whether you intend
meaning or not. So it is a very unusual experience to be in this
kind of position with this much attention for things that you have
no real conscious awareness or purpose for.''
</P>
<P>
   Intimations of Immortality  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he had waited 20 years to see the famous
excavation of terra-cotta warriors at Xian, the first stop in his
nine-day odyssey to the land of the emperors.
</P>
<P>
   The president, the first lady and daughter Chelsea were granted
the rare privilege of being allowed to descend to the floor of the
huge pit where 1,087 of Emperor Qin Shihuang's warriors stand rank
on rank.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of curators, Clinton donned white gloves and
placed a warrior head atop the body of one of the warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the sight of the warriors, which took more
than a decade to build and were buried with the emperor to guard
him after his death, humbled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I kept thinking how interesting it was that this
emperor thought so much about his death,'' Clinton said a bit
wistfully. ``In our culture, we don't think about it. Or we try not
to. But we also don't imagine as he did that we could preserve
whatever earthly power we have after death.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. presidents, of course, do not build pyramids or huge
mausoleums to preserve their memories and power after death. They
build libraries. Clinton has already selected a site for his in
Little Rock, along the banks of the gentle Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   Going Souvenir Hunting  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After their tour of the archaeological exhibits at Xian,
Clinton's party invaded the gift shop, where Clinton and Chelsea
engaged in some hard bargaining. They got a replica of a warrior
head, priced at $225, for $45.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine Bowles, the taciturn White House chief of staff, was
obviously moved by the warriors. He bought a full-size reproduction
for $1,100 and ordered it packed and shipped home to Charlotte,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife will either like it or she's going to kill me,''
Bowles said.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic and the Kitsch  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the president and his senior aides stayed at the
Diaoyutai guest compound, a collection of villas of various ages
and styles surrounding fishing lagoons built by the Jin Emperor
Zhang Zong in the 12th century. The complex is an oasis of greenery
and calm in the heart of the gritty bustle of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The American party marveled at the architecture and the decor of
the various buildings that housed them. Some are built and
decorated in traditional and tasteful Chinese style. Others can
only be described as embodying the design principles of the High
Stalin Era.
</P>
<P>
   The dining room of the villa housing Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright was a garish combination of Epcot Center
faux-Chinese and ``Saturday Night Fever,'' with pulsing lights and
green neon on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   A new gymnasium for high Communist Party functionaries and
distinguished visitors includes a motorized rock-climbing wall.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of reporters lodged near the president promptly
dubbed the compound ``Camp Commie.'' Americans who stayed at the
compound said the Chinese staff was large and very, very attentive.
</P>
<P>
   They Also Serve
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a week since President Clinton's flying
circus descended on China, and while eternal China will certainly
recover from the effects of the 1,000-member entourage, it is not
at all clear when, if ever, the staff of the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing will.
</P>
<P>
   Every worker in the embassy and many of their family members
were pressed into service as chauffeurs, translators, security
guards, tour guides, baggage handlers and shepherds of the huge
traveling party. They summoned cars for shopping expeditions, made
restaurant reservations and worked around the clock to insure that
no need went unmet.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials, in the last of the menial tasks assigned to
them, ran the final roundup of reporters as they boarded 10 buses
at the Shangri-La Hotel to take them to the airport Monday night
for the trip to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   One exhausted and exasperated middle-level diplomat said with a
sigh as he herded the last stragglers onto a bus, ``I went to
college for this?''

 &HT;    Union objects to BellSouth's deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Officials of the union confronting BellSouth at the
bargaining table object to BellSouth's $50 million contract with
three temporary employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's stance that the contract has no relevance
to the union, the Communications Workers of America apparently sees
the agreement as a potential issue in its high-stakes bargaining
with BellSouth. Those sessions are intended to produce contracts
for six company units before current contracts expire Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The current contracts do not provide for hiring the temporary
workers, said Noah Savant, an officer in the Communications Workers
of America for District 3, which covers the BellSouth territory.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spokesman Kevin Doyle said the company has long hired
temporary workers from a multitude of agencies and the union has
not raised a significant objection to that practice. BellSouth's
agreement with the three agencies _ Kelly, Norrell, and Blair
Temporaries and Staffing _ is meant to save money on the occasions
when the company must fill vacancies created by sickness or
vacation in office and administrative work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal _ released Wednesday by Blair _ comes at a
somewhat sensitive moment. BellSouth negotiators have been talking
to the Communications Workers of America, which represents 47,000
of BellSouth's 86,191 employees. Among the issues on the table is
the CWA concern about what it says is a BellSouth tendency to shift
jobs to outside contractors. BellSouth insists the agreement with
the temporary agencies is simply not an example of outsourcing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who come in for a few days, we cut them a
check and they go home,'' Doyle said. ``They don't wipe out a
company position.''

   Attorneys study `Valley of Death' basis, broadcast
</P>
<P>
   The full conclusion of the report filed by attorney Floyd Abrams
and CNN general counsel David Kohler on CNN's ``Valley of Death''
story:
</P>
<P>
   ``We hesitate to draw broad lessons from a single example of
journalistic overkill. We are lawyers, not journalists, and it must
rest with journalists to determine how best to avoid in the future
the pitfalls illustrated by this broadcast. We do offer the
following thoughts that have occurred to us as we reviewed the
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it should go without saying that fairness must come
first. The CNN broadcast was not fair. Information that was
inconsistent with the underlying conclusions reached by CNN was
ignored or minimized. The views of some of the individuals best
placed to know what happened _ the two A-1 pilots who dropped the
gas, the officer who commanded the operation, and the medic on the
ground _ were unduly discounted. Statements of sources that were
vague, ambiguous or qualified were relied upon as if they were
clear, focused and unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, journalistic errors led inexorably to more errors. The
determination that Admiral (Thomas) Moorer had confirmed themes of
their story when he had not led the producers to assert to a
significant confidential source that Moorer backed the story. The
result is that we cannot know to what degree the source was
influenced in his own answers by the reference to Moorer.
Similarly, the reference by the producer in her discussion with
another confidential source that a Defense Department document
concluded that CBU-15 was `accurate and effective' in its use in
Operation Tailwind was itself based on a probable misreading of the
letter. The impact on the source cannot be known to us. What we
must conclude, however, is that anything the source said thereafter
of a confirming nature must be significantly discounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, the degree of confidence _ approaching certainty _ of
the CNN journalists who prepared the broadcast of the conclusions
offered in it contributed greatly to the journalistic flaws
identified in this report. As we have observed, this was not a
broadcast that was lacking in substantial supportive materials.
Those materials, while justifying serious continued investigation,
were far too inconclusive to justify the conclusions reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was made by CNN to broadcast accusations of the
gravest sort without sufficient justification and in the face of
substantial persuasive information to the contrary. CNN should
retract the broadcast and apologize to the public and, in
particular, the participants in Operation Tailwind.''

 &HT;    CNN roiled by biggest blunder in resignations
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- CNN's Bobbie Battista called Thursday ``a tough day
for everyone at CNN,'' and CNN-U.S. President Richard Kaplan called
it ``totally devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that and much more.
</P>
<P>
   The news network took the strongest hit to its credibility in
its 18-year history Thursday _ a completely self-inflicted one _ as
it issued a retraction and apology for its story alleging that U.S.
military forces had used nerve gas on a mission in Laos in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, CNN ran a statement from its chairman, Tom
Johnson, that the report ``cannot be supported,'' acknowledging
``serious faults'' in the reporting, and apologizing to viewers and
the military personnel involved.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's statement, and the independent report it was based on,
carefully did not call the report incorrect, emphasizing instead
that the evidence did not support the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Although no procedural changes have been announced, Kaplan said
Thursday CNN is studying creating a new office of journalistic
standards to review such programs before they become problems.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout Thursday included the departure, under differing
circumstances, of three producers involved; a reprimand for
international correspondent Peter Arnett; and CNN's own
self-examination of its flaws, hour after hour. ``NewsStand'' will
air a further report on what happened and why at 10 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also made a quieter apology, by phone Wednesday night,
to Maj. Gen. Perry Smith, CNN's military adviser who had resigned
in protest over the report and helped fan the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the word vindication, but I'm very pleased that
CNN has published a strong retraction,'' Smith said Thursday from
his home in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   But other Vietnam veterans did use the word. ``It's a
vindication,'' said Stanley Olchovik, who was an Army Special
Forces major in Vietnam. ``I hope it puts enough pressure on the
media to be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the report, called ``Valley of Death,''
aired June 7 on the premiere of the newsmagazine ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP;
Time,'' serious questions were raised about its accuracy by
personnel involved in the mission, called Operation Tailwind.
Although CNN reported some of the controversy on air, behind the
scenes the doubts were spiraling.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson received phone calls from former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and former CIA Director Richard Helms, Kaplan said,
both of whom told Johnson that the story ``didn't smell right,'' in
Kaplan's words. Kaplan spoke with Gen. Colin Powell, who told him
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were casting more than doubt on it,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, which had taken the position in the early days that it
stood by its story, stopped saying anything at all publicly. Rumors
swirled in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Johnson had CNN's general counsel, David Kohler, call
Floyd Abrams, a noted First Amendment attorney who had defended CNN
in the past, and ask him to investigate the Operation Tailwind
story. Abrams reviewed outtakes of the interviews and producers'
notes, talked to CNN personnel involved, and even hired an
investigative firm to track down people with knowledge of Tailwind.
(CNN paid for the report.) Gen. Smith e-mailed Abrams pages and
pages of his own research and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   What Abrams found was what Johnson and others had privately come
to fear, that most of the criticism was on target. He said that CNN
ignored or downplayed several key figures in Tailwind _ such as the
two pilots who dropped the gas and a medic who treated victims _
who said that tear gas was used rather than nerve gas. He also
found that selective editing of witnesses in the on-air version
made them appear to support the nerve gas allegation more than
their full statements, in context, supported it.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams does not say the story was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of material they had gathered strongly pointed toward
the possibility that this gas had been used,'' he said Thursday in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said CNN's system of checks and balances failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We placed a great deal of faith in some of the most respected
and experienced journalists in America,'' CNN President Kaplan
said. ``In this case it was not well-placed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Valley of Death'' producer, April Oliver, had prepared a
150-page ``briefing book'' for the producers of ``NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bullish recitation of the sourcing,'' Abrams said.
``There was not sufficient attention paid to the sources who said
no. The impact of that was to provide a false comfort level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The briefing book itself is flawed, and therefore the vetting
was flawed,'' said Kaplan, referring to the network's review
process.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams delivered his report to Johnson on Wednesday, and the
decisions about who would go and what would be said were hammered
out at meetings at CNN Center Thursday. Producer Oliver was fired,
she acknowledged to the Associated Press, as was Jack Smith, senior
producer of ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time.'' Senior Executive Producer
Pam Hill, a nine-year CNN veteran, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The retraction and apology went under the TelePrompTer for
anchor Natalie Allen to read shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to handle this with dignity, but it's not pretty to
watch yourself pummeled in the press,'' Oliver told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this was a good-faith effort, it was an error that
happened on my watch,'' Hill said in a statement. ``I have resigned
to clear the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get through this,'' Kaplan said. `` 'NewsStand' will go
on and CNN will go on and everyone will be more vigilant. It points
up parts of our operation that need reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's a whole lot of people who should have looked
at this a lot harder, and I'm one of them,'' said Jeff Greenfield,
who anchored the ``NewsStand'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what Robert F. Kennedy said about Vietnam,''
Greenfield said. ``There's enough blame to go around.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola's quest for Inforum breaks down
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Coca-Cola Co.'s attempts to buy the Inforum
office building have collapsed for the second time in the past
year, renewing uncertainty over downtown leaders' efforts to spark
redevelopment around Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   The deal fell through because Coca-Cola ``could not reach a
satisfactory solution with all existing tenants,'' said Coca-Cola
spokesman Mark Preisinger.
</P>
<P>
   The 720,000-square-foot building, which occupies the block
between Spring Street and Techwood Drive at Baker Street, is about
60 percent occupied, with the Georgia Lottery as the largest
tenant. Plans called for Coca-Cola to install 3,000 to 4,000
employees in the building, which would have brought it to full
occupancy and made it the company's second-largest location after
its North Avenue headquarters building.
</P>
<P>
   The company had never revealed how much it was going to pay for
the Inforum, but it was priced as low as $30 million prior to the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola notified Equitable Cos., the New York-based insurance
giant that owns the building, on Thursday that the company ``has
decided not to acquire the Inforum property,'' Preisinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Equitable could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Coca-Cola remains ``very committed to downtown
Atlanta in general and the Centennial Olympic Park area in
particular,'' Preisinger said. ``We are currently considering our
other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Preisinger declined to identify other locations Coca-Cola might
consider.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coca-Cola, which has considered additional office
development off and on for several years, owns vacant land
diagonally across Techwood from the Inforum. The soft drink giant
staged its Olympic City festival there during the 1996 Games but
has not disclosed any future plans for the cleared site.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also owns undeveloped land at its North Avenue
headquarters complex and leases large blocks of space in Midtown
office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The six-story Inforum, which housed the headquarters of the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, was built nine years ago
for $150 million as a technology mart, part of architect-developer
John C. Portman Jr.'s trade mart complex.
</P>
<P>
   However, Portman, facing financial collapse in 1990, was forced
to turn the building over to Equitable. After the building failed
to attract enough technology tenants, Equitable opted to convert it
to office space in 1991. It has been up for sale for several years.

AMENDMENT SPELLS END OF DEATH PENALTY IN KANSAS, SOME PROSECUTORS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Is capital punishment dead in Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors think an amendment to the state's 4-year-old
death penalty law will make it more difficult to get a death
sentence. The amendment went into effect Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost really means we don't have a death penalty
anymore,'' said Jim Clark, executive director of the Kansas County
and District Attorneys Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although death penalty opponents don't foresee such a dramatic
effect, they are happy with any change that could limit use of the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those of us who oppose the death penalty, period,''
said Tim Emert, chairman of the Kansas Senate's judiciary
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The change requires a jury contemplating a death sentence to
first consider whether ``a term of imprisonment is sufficient to
defend and protect the people's safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the mandated prison term in such a case is life with no
chance of parole for 40 years, the new wording will apply in nearly
every case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make it much more difficult,'' said Johnson
County District Attorney Paul Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   The bill started as a proposal to expand the death penalty by
adding the premeditated killing of a child younger than 14 as one
of the crimes that qualified for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike Farmer, a Wichita Republican who opposes the death
penalty, added a proposed procedural change that would give a judge
the option of finding, before the case even went to trial, that a
prison term would sufficiently protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Carla Stovall led a contingent of district
attorneys in strongly opposing that measure. Emert said he also had
concerns about giving judges that kind of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that both the expansion and procedural change
were killed. But the wording about protecting the public through
imprisonment was added to the factors that jurors can use to vote
against a death sentence. The wording was tacked onto a bill that
was passed with several other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County District Attorney Nick Tomasic, one of the
prosecutors who fought the procedural change, said the Legislature
needs to decide whether it wants capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another attempt to water down the death penalty,''
Tomasic said.
</P>
<P>
   Stovall said she opposed the change and thinks it doesn't take
into consideration the safety of corrections officers, other
inmates or the possibility of escape.
</P>
<P>
   She said a defendant's eligibility for the death penalty
shouldn't be judged on whether he will be a future threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did to the victim should be the consideration on
whether or not he deserves the death penalty,'' Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, jurors deliberating a death penalty case must balance
a list of mitigating circumstances against a set of aggravating
circumstances in deciding whether a death sentence is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   An example of a mitigating circumstance is no significant
history of prior criminal activity. Aggravating circumstances
include previous murder convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The new amendment adds a mitigating circumstance. It will give
most defendants an automatic mitigating factor before any other
factors are even considered, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The change is welcome for attorneys who must defend people
facing a possible death sentence, but the effect won't be known
until it is actually argued to a jury, said Ron Wurtz, who heads
the state's death penalty defense unit.
</P>
<P>
   Wurtz thinks the new law puts in writing a question that most
jurors would consider anyway in a capital case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it an up-front issue,'' Wurtz said. ``I think it just
puts some honesty in the process. I think it will probably make for
a fairer trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Stovall agreed that most defense attorneys would argue to the
jury that their client would not be a threat if locked up in
prison. She said she hoped the measure would not hurt capital
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident jurors will be able to weigh all of the factors
and still make good decisions,'' Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   Emert said he did not consider the change a ``major detour'' to
death penalty prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so few to start with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kansas reinstated capital punishment in 1994 after a
22-year hiatus, two men have been convicted of capital murder and
sentenced to death. No executions have been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A number of others charged with capital murder have pleaded
guilty or no contest in exchange for life prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   To be charged with capital murder in Kansas, a defendant must
commit a premeditated killing in which at least one of seven
factors is involved. Those include a killing in connection with a
sex crime, killing more than one person or killing a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   If the defendant is found guilty, a jury then deliberates the
penalty. The jurors are instructed to determine whether the
aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, which has a much broader capital murder law that can
apply to any case of premeditated murder, has not had any major
changes in its law in the last several years, according to a
spokesman for the Missouri attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kansas, jurors in Missouri weigh aggravating and mitigating
factors in reaching their decision. Capital murder was reinstated
in Missouri 20 years ago; 32 executions have been carried out since
1989.

IN WAKE OF FIRES: CLOSED HIGHWAYS, DETOURS AND DASHED PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FLA-FIRES)

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Larry and Marcia Johnson shook the sand
from their beach towels, scowled at the floating ash turning the
sky gray and pondered their ruined Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race was a pretty big thing, the first night race at
Daytona,'' said Johnson, who had driven here from Ashville, N.Y.,
with his wife to attend the Pepsi 400 on Saturday night at Daytona
International Speedway. ``And now the race is postponed, and we're
going to have to go up the middle of the state to get home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of cancellations, vast detours and dashed plans in
places normally jammed for the Fourth of July holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of wildfires have closed highways here, including a
heavily traveled 140-mile stretch of Interstate 95 from
Jacksonville in the north to Titusville on the mid-peninsula coast.
The fires have also forced the evacuation of thousands of people in
Daytona Beach and the surrounding area, and cast a pall of smoke
over thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency procedures delivered a double whammy to the tens
of thousands of race fans who had already arrived in Daytona Beach
for a historic weekend. For the first time, a NASCAR race was to be
held at night, under new lights, at the famous speedway. It was
also to be the first prime-time television broadcast of a NASCAR
race.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning, officials at the speedway postponed the
race until Oct. 17. In light of the fires, they cited safety
concerns and traffic problems that would have been created by the
race, which was expected to attract thousands of fans for the
qualifying runs Thursday and Friday and a sellout crowd of 200,000
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But those fans quickly heard even more bad news: the closing of
the broad section of I-95, the main north-south highway that runs
the length of the Florida east coast. On an average day, 61,000
vehicles use that section of the Interstate. State transportation
officials said traffic for the Fourth of July weekend, the busiest
travel time of the year, was normally three to four times heavier.
</P>
<P>
   The section was closed at 10 p.m. Wednesday as wildfires along
the Interstate created so much smoke that visibility was reduced to
dangerous levels, state transportation and highway patrol officials
said. They were uncertain when it would be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers heading north were being routed along state roads, and
many found themselves behind long lines of tractor-trailer rigs.
Drivers going south to beaches and resorts for the three-day
weekend were dispatched west from Jacksonville on a 180-mile detour
along Interstate 10, Interstate 75 and Florida's Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday afternoon, transportation officials said
traffic was running smoothly on the roads and highways being used
in place of I-95.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was also smooth along Interstate 4 from Daytona Beach to
Orlando, where officials said the major theme parks were not
affected by the fires or smoke.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite temperatures approaching 100 degrees in Daytona Beach,
the beach was nearly deserted Thursday afternoon. Managers and
clerks at ocean-front hotels said they were getting many
cancellations from race fans and beachgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you couldn't get a parking spot on the beach,'' said
Bill Baker, who rents golf carts and four-wheelers for cruising the
beach at K.D. Cycles.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing on the radio that the race was postponed, the
Johnsons spent part of the afternoon lounging on beach towels
beside their car, which had several NASCAR decals on the windows
and a racing flag flying from a window. They said they would wait
until Thursday night to begin the drive home.
</P>
<P>
   But some fans were in no hurry to leave. In a parking area for
recreational vehicles near the speedway, Mary and Chocks Treleven
from Tallahassee, Fla., had set up camp with several friends
alongside their campers.

   ``We're going to party until the beer's gone,'' Mrs. Treleven

they made the right choice. I'm just in no hurry to get home.''

WATER PATROL WILL BE OUT FOR THE HOLIDAY TO AVERT DRUNKEN BOATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star

<P>
   LAKE OF THE OZARKS, Mo. _ Missouri Water Patrol officers quietly
anchored their boats at Mile Marker 19 just before midnight
Saturday on the lake's main channel near Osage Beach.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 a.m., they had randomly stopped 41 boats during a routine
sobriety checkpoint. Eight boat operators were arrested for being
drunk _ nearly one for every five ``pulled over.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a typical Kansas City Police Department sobriety
checkpoint on the roads will net arrests in only one of 20 cars
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 85 percent of the people we deal with on Friday night
or Saturday have been drinking,'' said Patrolman J. Pragman, who
was involved in the Osage Beach checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   As the Independence Day holiday kicks off, hundreds of boaters
will be heading for area lakes _ but some won't be going home. In
Missouri and elsewhere, authorities are finding that more people
than ever are dying in boating accidents involving alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   So while vacationers are loading up their crafts and their
coolers, Water Patrol officers are gearing up for a crackdown on
drunken boaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be out in full force, looking for violations,'' said
Pragman. ``...By Friday afternoon, it'll be organized chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Water Patrol said that on a typical weekend, the Lake of the
Ozarks will see 20,000 boats on the water. On holiday weekends that
number will at least double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the Fourth of July is the busiest boating weekend
of the year,'' said Cpl. Mark Richerson, a Water Patrol spokesman.
``We're hoping for no drownings and no fatalities, but to be quite
honest, if we see that, we'll be very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri had 25 boating fatalities in 1997, Richerson said. He
said that through June 21 this year, there had been 119 accidents
on Missouri waterways, resulting in 11 deaths. Most involved
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The Water Patrol is trying to combat the problem by getting
drunks off the water. Last Friday through Sunday, officers made 19
BWI, or ``boating while intoxicated,'' arrests on Lake of the
Ozarks alone.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests have steadily increased, from 95 in 1993 to 331 in
1997. So far this year, Water Patrol officers have arrested 142
drunken boaters statewide. Through roughly the same time frame last
year, they had made only 76 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Pragman's colleagues say he is one of the more aggressive
officers when it comes to nabbing drunken boaters. Perhaps that's
because in just three years Pragman has seen first-hand the tragic
consequences of drinking and boating.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, he helped investigate a crash that killed two
Kansas City firefighters and a Lee's Summit motorcycle officer. The
men were on a fishing trip when their 20-foot Regal Runabout
crashed into a 5-foot-high walkway made of reinforced galvanized
steel. The boat skidded nearly 80 feet before stopping on a wall,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests determined all three were legally drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, on Memorial Day weekend, Pragman
investigated an accident in which one boat ran over another. The
man in the boat that was hit fell into the water. His body wasn't
found for seven days. Both drivers were intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other driver drove away from the scene,'' Pragman said,
shaking his head. ``When we found him, he said he thought he had
hit a log.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the reasons for the increase in BWI arrests may
be heightened enforcement, or just more drunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're either getting better at it, or there's more and more of
them out there, or both,'' Richerson said. ``For one thing, we've
got more officers now than we ever had. But more importantly, we
have improved detection techniques. A lot of our people are
carrying PBTs, portable breath testing machines.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is more awareness about drunken boating.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting tired of not being able to take their
families to the lakes because of the drunk boat operators,''
Richerson said. ``Take Memorial Day weekend. We had 43 intoxicated
operators on Lake of the Ozarks alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinking in boats is allowed, Pragman said, as long as the
driver isn't drunk. He added, however, that ``the others in the
boat can be drunk, and they usually are.'' -More-

J.C. NICHOLS STOCKHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER WITH HIGHWOODS
PROPERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ J.C. Nichols Co. shareholders on Wednesday
approved a merger between the Nichols Co. and a North Carolina
firm, a move that ends local control over the company that shaped
much of Kansas City's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The merger with Highwoods Properties Inc. was approved by
holders of 3.5 million Nichols shares, about 76 percent of the
total. The merger required approval by holders of two-thirds of the
stock of Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is valued at $544 million, including $231 million in
Nichols Co. debt that Highwoods will assume. It is scheduled to be
completed by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Highwoods is a real estate investment trust based in Raleigh,
N.C. With its partnerships and subsidiaries, Highwoods develops,
manages, leases and acquires real estate, mostly suburban office
and industrial properties.
</P>
<P>
   The J.C. Nichols Co. is best known for its development and
ownership of the Country Club Plaza shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Clyde Nichols, founder of the Nichols Co., envisioned the
Plaza when he climbed a hill overlooking the sludgy Brush Creek
Valley in 1912. His company began developing the Plaza 10 years
later. With its fountains, walkways and Spanish architecture, it is
Kansas City's best known chunk of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald P. Gibson, Highwoods' president and chief executive
officer, on Wednesday described the Plaza as a ``crown jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare opportunity to become associated with such a high
quality piece of property,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Plaza, the Nichols Co. has developed neighborhoods,
shopping centers and office buildings around the Kansas City area.
Nichols developments include the cities of Fairway, Westwood,
Mission Hills, Mission Woods, Prairie Village, the Country Club
District residential neighborhood and much of the Brookside area.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols' developments are known for tree-lined streets and
generous doses of artistic amenities, including statues imported
from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Nichols Co. also has significant holdings in Des Moines,
Iowa. However, it failed in its effort to create a Plaza-like
development in St. Petersburg, Fla., several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Highwoods and Nichols said the Nichols Co. will
retain its name. Barrett Brady, president and chief executive
officer of the Nichols Co., will become a senior vice president of
Highwoods and will be Highwoods' top regional officer in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the merger with Highwoods came at a special meeting
of Nichols shareholders Wednesday morning at the Ritz-Carlton,
Kansas City. About 200 people attended.
</P>
<P>
   The merger agreement was praised by officials from Nichols and
Highwoods but drew criticism from some Nichols shareholders, one of
whom has waged a legal battle against the merger.
</P>
<P>
   That legal battle met a setback Wednesday afternoon when Jackson
County Circuit Judge William F. Mauer denied a request that the
court issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the merger's
completion.
</P>
<P>
   John Flake of Prairie Village, a Nichols shareholder, made the
request. Flake filed a class-action lawsuit in opposition to the
merger, on behalf of himself and other Nichols shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Mauer also did not grant Flake's request that the court hold a
hearing to consider a preliminary injunction to stop the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Mauer's decision said ``insufficient facts'' had been presented
to show that Flake and the other plaintiffs would suffer
irreparable harm if the merger went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Flake said he didn't know whether he would appeal Mauer's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols shareholders will receive cash, Highwoods stock or a
combination of both. Based on Wednesday's closing price of
Highwoods stock, the value to be received by Nichols shareholders
is $65 a share. The final exchange ratio for the stock part of the
transaction will be determined on the closing date.
</P>
<P>
   The Highwoods merger also was challenged by Blackacre Capital
Management of New York. Blackacre owns 14 percent of Nichols'
shares and made a $70-a-share cash offer for Nichols, subject to
certain conditions.

CAR COLLECTING: ON THE ROAD WITH AN E-TYPE JAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `a' category) 
(mk) 
 By VINCENT DE PAUL O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose you fulfill your fantasy and actually buy a classic car,
say a 1969 E-Type Jaguar roadster. What in the world would you do
with it?
</P>
<P>
   What if you cast prudence and all reason aside, hint at
adventure to a dear photographer friend and drive it cross-country
_ some 10,000 miles in 39 days? Cover 21 states, eight national
parks and four big cities. And while you're at it, endure five
breakdowns (the car's, not your own). After all, it is a '60s Jag,
a finicky breed of cat that many Americans love to look at, whether
it is tearing down the road or sitting on the shoulder waiting for
a tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   I had expected breakdowns when I set out last summer from Long
Island, with an itinerary that included stops in Seattle, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nev. But there were two
fascinating developments I had not anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the car's reception, or more accurately its lack
of one, between the coasts. It has always turned heads, thousands
of them, in New York, and was enthusiastically received in San
Francisco and Los Angeles. But in the 3,000 miles in between it
didn't cause much of a stir. In Buhl, Idaho, conversations were
more likely to center on the price of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The second was altitude sickness _ not mine, the car's. Out
West, everyone knows about the horrible effects of altitude on the
fuel and air mixture in older cars, which have no computers to
steady performance and only a limited range of adjustments. But I
didn't know that, and the ascent to the northeast entrance of
Yellowstone from Montana, the snaking Bear Tooth Pass (elevation
10,947 feet), was our first indication that we wouldn't hear the
engine run evenly again till we were at sea level in California. I
replaced the spark plugs four times during mountainous passages and
cleaned the carbon off the plugs' tips about every other day.
</P>
<P>
   Until I began to prepare for the trip, the car was just the way
it was made 29 years ago. To increase the low odds of a successful
journey, a guru of classic Jags, Mark Thornton of Sayville, N.Y.,
replaced the antiquated points and condenser with a relatively
new-to-the-market electronic ignition that fit in the same space.
He also added a computerized gizmo called a multiple spark
discharge box, which provides a significantly stronger jolt of
juice to the spark plugs, followed microseconds later with smaller
jolts _ the effect being virtually complete fuel combustion. In
essence, more oomph. The spark plug wires and the coil were
upgraded commensurately, the figuring being that the ignition
system posed the greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   When I left last June, Thornton was restoring a 1961 Jaguar Mark
II sedan for his wife. He suggested that I pack a spare alternator
and, gesturing toward his wife's car, added, ``I wouldn't even take
that car cross-country after I'm done with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After that less-than-ringing commentary on my plans, I loaded
the trunk with spares, but no alternator, since mine had been
rebuilt the year before. The alternator was the third thing to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the little sensor in the radiator that tells the
cooling fans to turn on. It quit on a steep grade at the beginning
of the Teton Pass just past Jackson, Wyo., and was the only failure
I was actually prepared for. The fans in my car are wired two ways,
one that worked off the sensor, like all other E-types, and one
that overrode it though a switch on the dashboard. If you change
the connections on a few wires, presto, the fans work. But you have
to remember to turn them on manually, and I will not recount here
the number of times I forgot.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was grand, with stops at the Badlands, Mount Rushmore,
Crazy Horse Mountain and Little Big Horn. Then came the altitude
sickness, starting at Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest trouble came after leaving Crater Lake National
Park in Oregon, when I heard a snapping noise behind me. Poking
around on the side of the road, I found that two of the 72 spokes
in the left rear wire wheel had broken. Further poking revealed a
broken cotter pin in the wheel bearing. Without that pin, a nut
slowly loosens and the wheel comes off, which is what was in the
process of happening. The stress from the loose wheel had snapped
the spokes. Using the spare wheel and a borrowed nail bent to work
like a cotter pin, we were back on the road; I found a replacement
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The alternator started squeaking near Crescent City in Northern
California, though the voltmeter on the dashboard indicated that it
was still putting out enough current to keep the car going. When
the squeak became a screech 80 miles later in Eureka, a phone call
to an alternator rebuilder another 120 miles away in Ukiah
persuaded me to push on, based on his guess that he could fix it.
He couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The next hope was in San Francisco, 120 miles to the south. The
alternator, by then howling for a warm spot in the junk yard sun,
made it. But if you've never traveled in the dark and the fog on
Highway 101, a succession of hairpin turns, you might not want to
add to your agitation by wondering whether you could manage it
without handy accessories like headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Several San Francisco shops actually had the correct rebuilt
alternator, and one was near the 49-mile scenic trail that many
tourists follow to see the city. So we picked up the new
alternator, I installed it in the street, and we spent the rest of
the day driving the trail.
</P>
<P>
   On the way down the coast we stopped in San Luis Obispo at XK's
Unlimited, a renowned rebuilder of classic Jaguars. While I ogled
their collection they retuned my carburetors for sea level,
straightening out the mess I had made of them along the way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lengthiest delay began when one of the rear shock absorbers
collapsed with startling suddenness not far from Zion National Park
in southern Utah, falling into the rear brake rotor and making an
awful metal-on-metal racket.
</P>
<P>
   There are four rear shocks on many Jags, not the traditional
two, and they are twinned, two on each side. After getting a tow 30
miles to Kanab, where the broken pieces were pulled out, we decided
that nothing would stop us from seeing the wonders of Grand Canyon
and Bryce Canyon National Parks, so we pressed on. It was great for
us, but too much to ask of the working twin, which sagged until the
car listed badly to port. It took two unscheduled days and nights
in Panguitch, Utah, before XK's Unlimited could ship replacements
to St. George, Utah, and a delivery service could get them the
remaining 90 miles. I installed them and headed East.
</P>
<P>
   But not before one last crisis. The down-pipe portion of the
exhaust system, which started the trip with an innocent little
leak, fractured on Interstate 70 on the way to Denver. After
fastening a clamp to the broken pipe, and electrical wire to the
clamp to tie it close to its original position, we roared over the
Rockies, sounding like a pack of Harley-Davidsons. The next day,
the local Midas dealer fabricated a new pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jaguar aficionados say I've set a record for trip distance
in this country in a classic E-Type, but they offer no hard
evidence. I've decided to ignore the lack of documentation and
claim a world record.
</P>
<P>
   Will I ever do something like this again? The sights were
magnificent, so of course. But next time I'll start by flying to
Denver and renting a younger car.

ANALYSIS: COULD EVENTS IN NIGERIA REKINDLE DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT
AFRICA?

(JT) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the Western governments that have watched with
dismay for the last three decades as much of Africa suffered
through chaos and bankruptcy, the news from Nigeria on Thursday is
the most gratifying from that continent since the establishment of
a multiracial government in South Africa under Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   If Nigeria could take even a few steps along the path toward
democracy, as implied by the reported pledge of its new military
government to release all political prisoners, it could encourage
other African governments to follow.
</P>
<P>
   It might enable Nigeria itself, a country with real
possibilities, to begin a comeback from decades of corruption,
dictatorship, ethnic tension and war. And it would ease the fears
of other West African leaders that political unrest and economic
deprivation would spill into their countries.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton and an entourage of more than 800 swept
through Africa last spring, they flew over Nigeria twice but never
landed.
</P>
<P>
   That pained the administration's Africa experts, from Assistant
Secretary of State Susan Rice on down. Nigeria counts. It is the
most important country in sub-Saharan Africa, with the possible
exception of South Africa. It is big, more than twice the size of
California. Its 110 million people make it Africa's most populous
nation. It is the fifth-largest supplier of oil to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But a visit from Clinton was out of the question, Ms. Rice said
at the time. The government of Gen. Sani Abacha, one of the world's
most repressive, annulled democratic elections in 1993, executed
nine environmental activists in 1995 and filled jails with its
opponents, including Moshood K.O. Abiola, the apparent victor in
the 1993 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended from the Commonwealth, subjected to sanctions by the
United States and others, Nigeria dug in its heels. Outsiders'
leverage ranged from limited to nonexistent, and no early change
seemed possible. On a visit to Nigeria, Pope John Paul II appealed
to Abacha to free the political prisoners and got exactly nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sent signals to Abacha that it would
not accept as a reform measure his plan to run as a civilian in
elections planned this August. But then Clinton grew so frustrated
with the lack of movement that he said in Cape Town that ``if he
stands for election, we hope he will stand as a civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparent concession brought no constructive response,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Then Abacha died suddenly of a heart attack on June 8, to be
succeeded by his colleague in the ruling junta, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar. And Abubakar, to the surprise of Nigerians and diplomats
alike, proved in many ways to be different from his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an opening, the U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan,
visited Nigeria this week, met with Abiola in jail on Tuesday and
declared Thursday that ``all political detainees will be released
and the government will make an announcement at the appropriate
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan also said that Abiola was ready to relinquish his claim to
the presidency. Diplomats in Washington and London suggested that
the secretary general had reiterated to Abiola the private urgings
of Western nations, including the United States, that he pledge to
cooperate with Abubakar as part of a face-saving arrangement that
would grant amnesty to all political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking British delegation, headed by Tony Lloyd, a
minister in the foreign office, visited Nigeria last weekend, and
an American group, headed by Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering, is to head there this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a carefully orchestrated process,'' one European
official said, ``not a deal exactly, but everyone understands the
transaction here. You might call it a political cease-fire leading
to the release of hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Abubakar has managed to hold the junta and the officer
corps together, although some analysts in the United States said
they feared that many officers were less committed than their
leader to national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming that the prisoners are released, Abubakar's next major
task will be to restore not only the army's self-respect but its
standing in the country. That will not be easy. Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, one of the prisoners already released by the new
government, said recently that the army had become ``a liability to
the nation,'' with ``no credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The military is one of the few truly national institutions in
Nigeria, where the Yoruba in the southwest, the Hausa in the north
and the Ibo and others in the southeast have often been at odds.
Obafemi Awolowo, one of the country's leaders in the early
post-colonial days, once said: ``West and East Nigeria are as
different as Ireland from Germany, and the north is as different
from either as China.''
</P>
<P>
   These differences greatly complicate matters. Abiola is a
Yoruba, and the army, as always, is dominated by Hausa officers.

   Slugfest looming &QL; 
on Centre Court
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ For a change, the form chart held. That four
male seeds made the Wimbledon semifinals is odd enough _ they tell
us it happens less than 50 percent of the time in Grand Slam
tournaments _ but the truth is the best four seeds did so as well,
convening for today's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Pete Sampras, Richard Krajicek, Goran Ivanisevic
and Tim Henman were really the only blokes who had solid chances to
wind up standing tall Sunday. None has had a particularly smashing
season, but grass-court tennis is ever a challenge unique unto
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Note the unexpected, yet hardly unfathomable, women's final:
Jana Novotna vs. Nathalie Tauziat. They are two wizened,
battled-hardened veterans of the turf wars who have put their years
of experience on the capricious lawns to excellent use.
</P>
<P>
   And as with the remaining pair of women, the aforementioned four
grasp the nuances of grass and have the proper smash-mouth games to
put their educations to good use. It's a two-part equation, the
solution of which escapes most.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Rios is No. 2 in the world behind Sampras, but he should
have faked an injury or illness and stayed home. The Chilean churl
and Wimbledon are never going to be amigos. Rios' first-round
defeat wasn't a shocker in the least. Nor was the one suffered by
the French Open champion, Carlos Moya, in the second. He told us
after his win at Roland Garros he had no chance here.
</P>
<P>
   Weak fall by the wayside
</P>
<P>
   OK, Petr Korda, the Czech ace (bandage), might be a bona fide
contender if he were ever healthy, but he won't be. You ever see
this guy's body? It's a bunch of fragile sticks held together with
baling wire. Korda has been known to pull muscles and strain
ligaments while sipping coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Rusedski's mental health is his obstacle. He, perhaps more
so than Henman, should be England's great hope, but the bogus Brit,
a Canadian by birth, is a mess, as the recent run of his fed-up,
fleeing coaches will attest.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Philippoussis, Australia's Greek-god would-be Sampras
clone, can't seem to get his handsome head right, either, although
slamming headfirst into Pete as he did in the quarters made for an
additional complication.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras often plays elsewhere as though his mind is on
non-tennis matters, but Wimbledon is one temple he dares not
desecrate. He laps the field on his best Centre Court days, and on
his worst he's still where the smart money belongs.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe he was a first-round loser the first two
times he visited and a second-round pigeon the third year. But
since, he has soared with the eagles, suffering a mere two defeats
in 44 matches, leaving him positioned to equal Bjorn Borg's Open
Era record of five titles.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the two thugs to mug him is certain to be waiting in
the final. Krajicek ('96 quarterfinals) and Ivanisevic ('92
semifinals) will wallop aces at each other today in the preliminary
to Sampras-Henman, the latter being perhaps the most anticipated
match on Centre Court since Virginia Wade's victorious Wimbledon
centennial final of 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Henman, a baby-faced boomer of 23 whose slight frame belies the
G-force behind his serve, has given the English something about
which to cheer in a week when they badly need cheering up. Like
Sampras, he chases a bit of history of his own as the lone native
son in a quarter of a century to reach the Wimbledon semis.
</P>
<P>
   Henman has rare opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Should he beat Sampras, then go the distance, he would become
the first Brit in 62 years _ since the late Fred Perry completed
his three-peat in 1936 _ to hold the cup aloft Sunday afternoon.
Which might be almost enough to put England's mind at ease over the
end of its World Cup bid, lost on a penalty shootout against
Argentina on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But asking Henman to handle Sampras on Pete's home court, the
staunch loyalties of the spectators notwithstanding, might be a tad
unfair. The tide of emotion will carry Henman only so far, and the
burden of expectations could create a damaging counter-drag. If
Sampras is on, Henman goes off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Krajicek and Ivanisevic, the Dutchman and the Croat who are
tax-saving neighbors in Monte Carlo, should stage quite the
donnybrook. Although Ivanisevic spots Krajicek an inch and 10
pounds, Goran's lefthandedness is the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   The twice Wimbledon runner-up, to Andre Agassi in '92 and
Sampras in '94, has beaten the '96 champion in eight consecutive
matches, but the three most recent ones have gone three sets with
Ivanisevic winning tiebreakers in the third. Six of their past 11
sets have required tiebreaks.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes for a long and, by definition, brutish afternoon of
elemental grass-court tennis. Only the strong have survived to
fight again. The meek never shall inherit this well-worn patch of
sodded earth.

 &HT;    Spiderman caught in a web
 &HT;    By Monika Gonzalez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Spiderman _ a burglar detectives say
scaled high-rise condominiums to slip through unlocked balcony
doors _ is sitting in a Broward County jail cell doing something
else spiders do.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Gregory James has not been charged with burglary, but
police said he was caught in the act.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they expect charges will be filed against James
within the next two weeks. Tuesday, they charged a suspected
accomplice, Derrick Davis, 28, of Miami Lakes, with 32 counts of
forgery, grand theft and passing on a forged document, the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement reported.
</P>
<P>
   James, a former paratrooper from Miami-Dade County, was already
wanted on an unrelated warrant issued in April 1997 _ long before
many of the burglaries. He is being held on violation of sentencing
rules, stemming from an earlier conviction.
</P>
<P>
   James was supposed to be serving out a house-arrest sentence for
grand theft, and probation officials said he wasn't staying home as
required. James was allowed to leave home only for work. Department
records show he was unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect Spiderman in more than 100 burglaries from
Brevard County to Miami _ thefts totaling $6 million in cash,
jewelry, credit cards and computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter and Boca Raton police are among about 45 law enforcement
agencies that consider James a suspect in high-rise burglary cases.
</P>
<P>
   Because James is being held without bail until a
probation-violation hearing, detectives say they have more time to
research and prepare cases for filing with a statewide prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   A task force led by the FDLE had been working to determine his
identity for about a year, an FDLE spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always referred to him as Spiderman,'' said Jupiter Sgt.
Tom Flannery.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Jupiter detectives have reviewed
unsolved burglary cases dating back at least three years to see how
many may be linked to the elusive Spiderman.
</P>
<P>
   James surfaced as a suspect months ago based on clues and
information discovered by several Miami-Dade County police
agencies, police in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties said.
</P>
<P>
   A network of detectives staked out several locations, including
Bristol Tower, a 30-story building on Brickell Avenue in Miami,
police sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spiderman walked into their web.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they saw his tall, muscular frame walk into Bristol
Tower _ but then they lost him. Later, they spotted the burglar
carrying, among other things, jewelry labeled with a burglary
victim's name.

FAILED TESTS ON MONKEYS FRUSTRATE HOPES FOR HUMAN AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Hopes for a vaccine against AIDS were set back at the
12th World AIDS Conference here Thursday when researchers reported
that a vaccine made from a weakened simian virus and injected into
monkeys has caused the disease it was designed to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was made by deleting genes from a version of the
simian virus. Many experts had looked to this SIV vaccine as the
best model for developing a human counterpart, because it seemed to
provide the strongest evidence of protection against an AIDS-like
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings leave researchers little ahead of where they
were when the disease was identified a decade ago, two leading
American AIDS experts said here. They are Dr. Anthony Fauci, head
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in
Bethesda, Md., and Dr. Robert Gallo, a co-discoverer of the human
immunodeficiency virus, who works at the Institute of Human
Virology in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said the new findings show that he and other federal
officials were correct in urging caution in testing vaccines made
from artificially weakened, or attenuated, AIDS virus. More than
300 doctors in the United States and elsewhere have pleaded with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to let them become human
guinea pigs for a similar experimental vaccine made from a weakened
HIV. Therion Biologics Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., is trying to
develop such a human AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group of doctors, Charles Farthing, an AIDS
specialist in Los Angeles, said that he would still volunteer to
test an attenuated AIDS vaccine, despite Thursday's news. Farthing
repeated his plea in a talk at the meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report came from Dr. Ruth Ruprecht, a scientist at the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. She said that the weakened SIV
injected into monkeys mutated to cause simian AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Dr. Ruprecht began her experiments by injecting nine
newborn monkeys with the weakened SIV vaccine developed by Dr.
Ronald Desrosiers of the New England Primate Center in Southboro,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had reported earlier that some of these monkeys
became ill, Thursday she said, ``we have some rather sobering
news'' that all newborn monkeys given the vaccine are ill or dead.
Of the nine newborn monkeys injected with the weakened SIV, six
have developed simian AIDS and five of them have died. The
remaining three monkeys are ill or have immunological abnormalities
related to simian AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts had said that an AIDS vaccine given to newborns
would not work because their immune systems were immature. But
Thursday Dr. Ruprecht had similar news about tests on adult
monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Of 15 vaccinated adult monkeys, four have had the virus return
after it initially disappeared. Of the four, one is dead of simian
AIDS, one has early-stage disease and two have developed
immunological abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   All the newborn and adult monkeys developed simian AIDS from the
initial injection with SIV and not from a second injection designed
to test its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw with the infants was a fast-forward version of
what can happen to vaccinated adults,'' Dr. Ruprecht said. ``It's
not going to lead to a safe vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called for development of an AIDS vaccine
in nine years. But many health officials and others are calling for
the administration to provide more money to meet his challenge,
saying that a vaccine is needed as the major weapon to stop the
AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many vaccines are made by weakening a live virus. Others are
made by killing a virus. Some newer vaccines are made from tiny
portions of a virus, using genetic engineering techniques.
</P>
<P>
   HIV is notorious for its ability to mutate, and the possibility
has led many experts to shun making a live attenuated vaccine. They
have said that a variety of approaches will be needed to develop an
AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes two types of vaccines are needed to protect. For
example, both the killed Salk vaccine and weakened live Sabin
vaccine have brought polio to the verge of eradication.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the FDA authorized the first full-scale test of an
AIDS vaccine, one genetically engineered by Vaxgen of South San
Francisco. The vaccine is made from a fragment of the outer shell
of the AIDS virus. Scientists are divided about the degree of
protection it will afford.
</P>
<P>
   The research that led to Thursday's report on a live attenuated
AIDS vaccine began in 1992 when Desrosiers reported that his team
in Massachusetts had prepared an experimental vaccine by deleting a
gene known as nef from SIV. Desrosiers reported that he had given
the nef-deleted SIV to six monkeys that did not develop simian AIDS
even after injection of SIV containing all its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the nef gene got another boost in 1992 when Jennifer
Learmont, a Red Cross official in Sydney, Australia, reported that
five people who had developed HIV from contaminated blood
transfusions did not seem to be developing AIDS. More startling was
that the blood donor also had been infected for many years without
developing AIDS. The strain carried by the donor was naturally
missing the nef gene.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Learmont said here Thursday that the Australian patients
still had not developed AIDS 14 years after becoming infected
although the number of CD4 immune cells in their blood was
beginning to decline, a possible sign that the infection was
progressing.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual cluster has led Australian researchers to try to
develop an AIDS vaccine derived from the nef-deleted virus from the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruprecht said she originally shared Farthing's optimism
about the prospects of a live attenuated AIDS virus because so many
other human vaccines were based on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   She said that in 1993 she began her experiments on newborn
monkeys after obtaining the virus from Desrosiers. The experiments
were patterned after those that showed that a human vaccine could
provide about 95 percent protection against the liver infection,
hepatitis B, if given shortly after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruprecht said that other scientists, including Desrosiers,
have found that monkeys injected with genetically weakened SIV have
become ill or died.
</P>
<P>
   The simian findings shed new light on the nef gene, which
scientists thought was responsible for the virulence of the virus.
Dr. Ruprecht said in an interview that her research has taught that
deletion of the nef gene is not safe for a vaccine because it can
still produce disease.
</P>
<P>
   That shows that other genes must be involved. Like Desrosiers,
Dr. Ruprecht is studying other HIV genes to determine if any could
be deleted singly or in combination to develop a different
attenuated vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Farthing said that earlier this year the FDA had given the green
light for further research to develop a live attenuated HIV
vaccine. But he said it would be two or more years before human
trials of such a vaccine could begin.
</P>
<P>
   The initial tests of a vaccine or other drug are designed to
test safety, not effectiveness. The history of vaccine development
is replete with examples of scientists who have been the first
human guinea pig.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier interviews, Desrosiers has said that he was unwilling
to test his HIV vaccine on himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Farthing, who is not involved in the vaccine's development,
said Thursday: ``The only way to find out if it works is to test it
in humans. SIV is not HIV and monkeys are not humans.''
</P>
<P>
   If the vaccine proved unsafe and he developed HIV, Farthing said
he would take the newer combination of drugs that controls HIV in
many people. &QL;

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ to certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the Blackacre group presented themselves at
Wednesday's special meeting of Nichols shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that shareholders left value on the table, a
minimum of $8 to $10 (per share),'' Ronald Kravit, a Blackacre
principal, said in a telephone interview after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Price Sloan, Nichols' general counsel, countered that the Morgan
Stanley investment banking firm issued an opinion stating that the
Highwoods transaction was fair to all Nichols shareholders from a
financial standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Sloan said Institutional Shareholder Services, the leading
advisory firm to institutional shareholders, considered both the
Highwoods and Blackacre proposal and then recommended that Nichols
shareholders vote for the Highwoods merger.
</P>
<P>
   Flake said he attended Wednesday's meeting but did not speak out
when the floor was opened for questions because he thought it
``wouldn't have made any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed in how it went,'' Flake said. ``I had
hoped it wouldn't pass, but I was afraid it was going to, because
of all the time and money the officers had spent trying to get
everybody to vote in favor of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, Highwoods' president and chief executive officer, said
Highwoods was attracted by the Nichols Co.'s talents and assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look to the people first,'' Gibson said. ``People who are
credible in the community and have significant market share.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Nichols name will be kept because of its great
recognition value.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said Highwoods and Nichols will develop a strategic plan
``that will feature a very aggressive posture toward developing
retail, office and industrial properties in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Highwoods is committed to all current Nichols Co. plans for
development and redevelopment, including plans to redevelop the
Plaza, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his own company, Gibson said Highwoods has grown
through mergers and acquisitions. He said the 25-year-old company
has never defaulted on a loan or had to give a property back to a
lender.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smart, a longtime Nichols shareholder who is the chairman
of the Perkins Smart and Boyd Inc. investment firm in Fairway, said
Wednesday's vote came as ``a very big surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart said many believed the merger would not get the two-thirds
affirmative vote that it required, especially since a fairly
sizable contingent of shareholders voiced disapproval about what
they considered a low offering price for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, shareholders seemed to be weary, Smart said.
Different stockholders have feuded with different managers on and
off for more than 3 1/2 years. Even dissatisfied stockholders
apparently preferred accepting the Highwoods deal with its
allegedly lower price instead of continuing a fight for a year or
two, Smart said.
</P>
<P>
   Barney A. Karbank, a Nichols shareholder and chairman of the
B.A. Karbank &AMP; Co. real estate firm, said it was ``unfortunate that
a company as important to the Kansas City area and its economy is
losing local ownership and control.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brady said the vote represented a ``great day for the
Nichols Co.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial muscle and expertise of Highwoods, coupled with
the local knowledge and local team that's in place here, will bode
well for the J.C. Nichols Co. and the community,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Callison, a Nichols board member and daughter of Nichols Co.
chairman emeritus Miller Nichols, said she was pleased by the high
level of shareholder support for the Highwoods deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with Highwoods,'' said Callison, who was
designated as a Highwoods board member Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The votes of participants in Nichols' employee stock ownership
plan were crucial because the merger required the approval of
holders of at least two-thirds of Nichols stock.
</P>
<P>
   Audy Waldrop, a Nichols employee stock ownership plan
participant who attended Wednesday's meeting, said he supported the
Highwoods merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us this is like a retirement account,'' said Waldrop, who
formerly did maintenance work at Nichols apartments. ``I can take
the cash and roll it over into something that's more lucrative and
I will have more personal control over.''

CHANGES TO `JOB' BRING MORE TEMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: My job could be at risk. So could yours.
</P>
<P>
   Before we run around in a millennium panic, though, let's define
terms, starting with the word ``job.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of U.S. workers _ maybe up to 20 percent,
according to the Society for Human Resource Management _ already
understand the new definition. They are members of the contingency
work force, which includes temporary, leased, free-lance and
on-call workers, independent contractors and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   They are workers ``who have little or no attachment to the
company at which they work. Whether they work, when they work and
how much they work depend on the company's need for them. They have
neither an explicit nor implicit contract for continuing
employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words of Helen Axel and Stanley Nolen, business
researchers and authors of (italics begin here) Managing Contingent
Workers: How to Reap the Benefits and Reduce the Risks(italics end
here).
</P>
<P>
   And throughout the U.S. business world, employers are reaping
and reducing.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for example, began to eliminate many regular payroll jobs
seven years ago. But instead of just saying bye-bye to employees,
the company channeled many of them to its internal staffing
service, Resource Link. There, the downsized employees jumped into
a pool of workers to do AT&AMP;T ``jobs'' on an as-needed, or
contingency, basis.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, AT&AMP;T filled the Resource Link pool with workers
whose jobs were eliminated or at risk. Today, half of the pool is
occupied by workers who choose the option because of the
flexibility and cross-training opportunities they believe
contingency work provides.
</P>
<P>
   True, the AT&AMP;T experience is enhanced because the company
continued to provide employee benefits to Resource Link workers.
That's a comfort many contingency workers don't have.
</P>
<P>
   But the phenomenal national growth in temporary staffing _ the
number of professional temps has quadrupled since 1991, according
to the National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services _ is
prompting industry changes.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations such as Working Today are promoting portable
benefits and group insurance purchase prices for independent
contractors so they have the same safety nets as traditional
employees.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk about the new face of the work force I thought had
hit home the other day when I read a posting on our office bulletin
board. Someone had found a report on the labornet.org Web site
about a May 30 appearance in Ann Arbor, Mich., by the chairman of
our parent company. It concerned a symposium on ``The Information
Revolution in Midstream.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the story, originated by an alternative weekly
paper in Detroit, was inaccurate. It wrongly attributed to Tony
Ridder, chairman of Knight Ridder, the comments that ``jobs will be
irrelevant in the future'' and workers of the future will be
independent contractors working on a free-lance basis.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were made by another panelist, Graham Whitehead, a
British Telecom vice president. Last I checked, British Telecom
doesn't own us.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, such predictions about the future work force are
widespread. It (itals here)could(end itals) have been any CEO. So
watch this space. I'm not exactly sure when the ``future'' is, but
I'm trying to find out whether free-lance columnists charge by the
inch.

SAM'S TOWN PAYMENTS TO LOCAL AGENCIES WON'T STOP WHEN CASINO
CLOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As Sam's Town executives announced the
casino's imminent closing Tuesday morning, hundreds of area postal
carriers were delivering the riverboat's latest promotional offer
to players _ a two-for-one buffet dinner deal.
</P>
<P>
   Those bargain coupons were part of a new direct-mail advertising
initiative launched this week by Mark Aiello, marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure to look out for more discounts and special offers I'll
be sending your way, because this coupon is just the beginning!''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it was the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Aiello had no idea this was happening until Monday
morning,'' said Rob Stillwell, spokesman for Las Vegas-based Boyd
Gaming Corp.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three years of red ink, the gaming company said
Tuesday that it was pulling the plug and selling its troubled
Kansas City property to competitor Harrah's Entertainment Inc. The
casino will close within 60 days, costing 646 workers their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It may jeopardize gambling tax revenue that Kansas City collects
at Sam's Town, although scheduled payments of hundreds of thousands
of dollars to area agencies, including scholarship funds, will
continue for seven years. A loan program for minority- and
women-owned businesses, however, will die with the casino.
</P>
<P>
   With a local gaming industry turnover rate that approaches 50
percent a year, those Sam's Town employees aren't likely to be out
of work for long.
</P>
<P>
   Both Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel and Station
Casino Kansas City are the hosts of job fairs this week so Sam's
Town employees can learn about company benefits and submit
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Boyd Gaming and Harrah's operate more than two dozen
casinos in other states, and the companies said they would make
relocation offers to some Sam's Town workers.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Sanfilippo, president of Harrah's riverboat division,
said Wednesday that firm job offers were being made to some Sam's
Town workers on Tuesday within an hour of Boyd's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon Wednesday, Station Casino General Manager John
Finamore said 60 Sam's Town workers were already on Station's
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have offers out to a number of others and they're still
streaming in,'' he said. ``We're very, very happy with the quality
and quantity of employees we're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said the bulk of those hired were table game dealers,
slot machine attendants, and food and beverage workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few walk-ins,'' Argosy General Manager Larry
Kinser said Wednesday. ``We're pretty well fully staffed, but we
are looking for a few specific jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Station's job fair, at the casino, continues today and Friday
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Stillwell said Sam's Town players club members would be allowed
to redeem their earned points for cash and merchandise until the
casino closes _ which is expected to be a matter of weeks as key
employees depart for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss of casino jobs and marketing freebies aren't the
only consequences in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in September 1995, Sam's Town has paid $41
million in direct gaming taxes to the city and state, plus millions
more in sales and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Most if not all of those gaming tax dollars are expected to be
recovered as Sam's players increase their visits to other casinos
in Kansas City, North Kansas City and Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Kansas City is how much of the estimated $2
million in annual gaming taxes the city budget ultimately will
lose. A spokesman for the mayor's office said Wednesday that the
issue was under intense review.
</P>
<P>
   Most casino revenue is funneled into the city's capital
improvements program for street repair, public parks and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boyd Gaming will continue _ for seven years _ making
annual payments totaling $350,000 to various public and private
agencies in the area to fund a city scholarship program, riverfront
park development, tourism marketing, and research on the causes and
treatment of compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me yesterday, face to face, they are going to honor
those commitments,'' Kansas City Port Authority lawyer Phil
Kuznetsky said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The city's college scholarship program got under way in recent
weeks after nearly three years of planning while the fund has
accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd and Station each pay $50,000 a year to the Kansas City
Council's Opportunities Scholarship Fund to aid financially needy
students ages 17 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Kansas City Community Foundation and Affiliated
Trusts administers the program and will select the first recipients
later this summer, said Earnest Rouse, of the city manager's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Students can renew their annual stipends, which are expected to
average $1,000 a year, as long as they remain in college.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, Boyd also has managed a minority- and women-owned
business loan program and community outreach grant fund that, over
three years, has received $350,000. Those programs will cease with
the casino's closing, Stillwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's has made no decision yet on what the company will do
with Boyd's 254-foot-long Judy's Prize riverboat and 31-acre tract
that includes a 1,300-car parking garage and an 80,000-square-foot
retail and office structure. Unlike the larger of Harrah's two area
casinos, Judy's Prize is a motorized vessel fully certified to
navigate the river.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,600-passenger riverboat could come in handy later this
year if Missouri voters reject a proposed ``boats in moats'' ballot
measure to retroactively legalize noncruising riverboats moored off
river in man-made ponds and lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   Games of chance at Sam's Town and three of the four other Kansas
City gambling operations are threatened with closing if voters do
not approve the measure. Under a 1997 Missouri Supreme Court
decision, those games, including slot machines, are only legal
aboard vessels moored directly in the river's flow.
</P>
<P>
   Sanfilippo insisted Wednesday that the purchase of Sam's Town
was unrelated to the boats-in-moats issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not looked at it that way at all,'' he said. ``We're
confident that the outcome in November will be positive for us.''

OLD FRIENDS, NEW ARRIVALS ON HOLIDAY AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: It has been our rule, when on vacation, never to count
away the days _ just spend them easily, and let the end come as a
surprise. Otherwise, there's sadness from the very start.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with daughters grown and occupied with lives of their own,
occasions as a family all together are harder to come by, and the
rule about ignoring time's brevity is even more important.
</P>
<P>
   For part of this week, the daughter working in New York will be
home for the holiday, and her sister has gotten tickets for the two
of them to some raucous musical event.
</P>
<P>
   One day, if the weather allows, we'll go to the country and pass
a few hours fishing and grazing in the blackberry patch. Part of
another _ the holiday itself _ we'll spend with friends. Beyond
that, not much is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, I think, we will just want to talk. It isn't that we've
been out of touch. We have quite regular telephone conversations,
but, as anyone knows, those are somehow not entirely real, or at
any rate do not suffice.
</P>
<P>
   I'll hope to get some sense of how much longer she means to make
her career in that far-off, alien city.
</P>
<P>
   New York's no more inhospitable or wicked a place than most any
other. I used to believe it was, but several visits there have
softened my view.
</P>
<P>
   The problem simply is one of distance. I know people whose
children have scattered like thistledown to the farthest corners of
this country and even of the planet. And I'm sure there are fine
adventures to be found there. But I'm uneasy with that. Something
in me despises separation.
</P>
<P>
   /{Planes fly,/} those people say. And it's true. But one is too
seldom on them.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, we'll want to hear the latest news about her new
family. In a matter of only months, she has gone from being a young
woman alone in a fifth-floor walk-up to being the matriarch and
sole caretaker of a gang of seven.
</P>
<P>
   First she was joined by the gray tabby kitten Zipper, a little
female. Then came Valentine, also only weeks old, gotten from a
shelter, as company for Zip.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally it was essential for Valentine, who was male, to be
neutered as soon as he was of an age for it. In certain matters,
paying close attention to time is essential. But sometimes, as the
song says, /{time just gets away./}
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had his surgery all right. Taking into consideration
the 62- to 63-day gestation period of cats, and counting backward,
his surgery was about one week too late.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite her relative youth and small size, Zipper was
delivered of five surprises. By sheer luck, it happened when the
mistress of the apartment was there to witness the birthing, which
she managed to do without fainting.
</P>
<P>
   Zip is reported to be a good mother and Valentine an interested
father, though somewhat baffled as new fathers usually are. All are
reported doing well. The kittens' eyes are just opening. And
already all are spoken for, meaning that they will not become
public charges of the city of New York.
</P>
<P>
   This we've been told over the telephone, but that's what I mean
by phone calls being inadequate. We've been impatient for our
daughter's visit, and of course we're eager to see her for herself.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, like any grandparents, we can't wait to see
the pictures.
</P>

   LAKE OF THE OZARKS, Mo. _ they usually are.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers must have probable cause, such as no registration decal
or improper lights, to stop a boat. If an officer smells the odor
of intoxicants or notices that the driver is wobbling, has
bloodshot eyes or slurred speech, he will perform a field sobriety
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't really do any kind of balance tests out here,''
Pragman said, ``so we do alphabet tests, have them count backward,
that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, where the blood alcohol level limit is .10 _ the
same as with cars _ the first two offenses are misdemeanors. The
third offense is a Class D felony, with a maximum penalty of five
years in jail and/or $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   A BWI conviction, however, does not affect licenses, because a
person doesn't need a license to operate a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, lakes are patroled by Fish and Game officers. The
legal limit for intoxication is .08, the same as for motorists.
First offenses are misdemeanors, but habitual violators can be
charged with felonies by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Boaters also are subjected to the elements _ the sun, the wind,
the vibration of the boat and the glare on the water, Richerson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually call it boater's hypnosis,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Richerson said studies have shown that four hours of exposure to
the ``boater's hypnosis'' elements can have the same effects on
people as intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the changing face of boating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing both ends of the spectrum,'' Richerson said.
``Some boats are getting bigger and more powerful, but we're also
seeing an increased number of personal water craft, which are
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Some boats, he said, can hit speeds up to 100 mph. Even the
small water craft can go up to 60 mph or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also seeing the bigger offshore boats which have a lot
of speed, but less maneuverability, then we're seeing bigger
cruisers and houseboats which have less speed and less
maneuverability,'' Richerson noted. ``And we still have the bass
boats and the runabouts, too. There's just congestion in general.''
</P>
<P>
   However, authorities don't think that a $24 million bridge that
opened in May and connects Lake Ozark to Shawnee Bend will worsen
the congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have established places on the lake have just been
driving longer to get to them,'' said Water Patrol Sgt. Hans
Huenink. ``It cuts your drive time down from two hours to 30
minutes, so this just makes it more convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also said that the infamous ``Party Cove'' _ an area
where boats gather and complaints of noise, public nudity and sex
are common _ does not contribute to the increase in BWIs as much as
its name suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They remain stationary in there for the most part,'' Huenink
said, ``so we don't get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As he cruised the lake earlier this week in his 28-foot
Challenger, Pragman pulled alongside a group of young men on a
craft called the ``Party Barge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything OK?'' he asked. They assured him that things were
great.
</P>
<P>
   Pragman nodded and headed back across the lake, slowing when the
boat slammed into a wave created by a passing cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing,'' he said. ``This weekend, there'll be so
many people out here, the waves will be nonstop. And that's when
our work really begins.''

CNN RETRACTS REPORT THAT MILITARY USED LETHAL NERVE GAS IN LAOS IN
1970 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN AND FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presented with an independent investigation concluding that it
stretched the available evidence beyond the breaking point, the
Cable News Network on Thursday retracted its report that the U.S.
military had used lethal nerve gas in a secret 1970 mission in Laos
intended to eliminate American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast, which was accompanied by the fanfare of advance
publicity common in the growing community of broadcast news
magazines, was shown on June 7 as the feature presentation on the
first broadcast of the news magazine show ``CNN Newstand Time,'' a
joint venture with Time magazine that was being hailed within the
Time-Warner empire as the fruit of productive synergy between the
company's disparate news gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The apology amounted to a devastating admission that the report
had falsely cast the United States government, and in particular
its military and intelligence arms, as brazenly using and
concealing the use of sarin nerve gas, one of the most forbidden
weapons in the modern arsenal that is banned by numerous
international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the piece was broadcast, a slightly modified version
of the account of a mission that was code-named Operation Tailwind
was published in Time. Journalists at Time and CNN said Thursday
that the story was broadcast and published despite memos and
complaints raised by journalists within both organizations who
received a last-minute chance to examine the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that CNN alone was responsible for the erroneous report,
Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN News Group, issued a statement
Thursday saying, ``We acknowledge serious faults in the use of
sources who provided Newsstand with the original reports and
therefore retract the Tailwind story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at Time for
this mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Magazine's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, also issued a
retraction and an apology for the story, which appeared under the
bylines of a producer, April Oliver, and Peter Arnett, a
Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist whose visibility across a 30-year
career had made him perhaps the network's most prominent
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive with the network confirmed Thursday that
Arnett had been reprimanded for his work on the story. Ms. Oliver
and her colleague Jack Smith, the two producers who had led the
eight-month reporting effort, declined a suggestion that they
resign and were fired. Pamela Hill, the noted documentary producer
who as the executive producer of CNN Newstand Time, made the basic
decision to broadcast the report, also submitted her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the firings, resignations and recriminations within
Time-Warner, the report, conducted by Floyd Abrams, the noted
constitutional attorney, offered a microscopic examination of how
the basic fabric of journalism can unravel.
</P>
<P>
   His report showed no venality, willful deception or illegality,
but a more subtle process of distortion that began when conclusions
outstripped the available evidence, continued when sources were
encouraged to believe that unseen evidence proved their own
suspicions to be true and was compounded by interviews laced with
hypothetical questions and ambiguous answers. Ultimately, the
report concluded, the journalists refused to give more than a
glancing nod to a series of denials by witnesses that sarin gas
could have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CNN journalists involved in this project believed in every
word they wrote,'' according to the Abrams report. ``If anything,
the serious flaws in the broadcast that we identify in this report
may stem from the depths of those beliefs and the degree to which
the journalists discounted contrary information they received
precisely because they were so firmly persuaded that what they were
broadcasting was true.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as her work was being repudiated and she was being
fired by her employer, Ms. Oliver, the producer of the piece,
refused to back away from her conclusions. ``I feel that this
report was solid,'' said Ms. Oliver, 36, ``that I made every step
any journalist would take to insure its accuracy and that I had the
full backing of management all the way up to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters, Abrams said he enlisted
former intelligence officers from the investigative firm of Jules
Kroll to try to confirm the account independently through their own
military, intelligence and diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
   His report included devastating details of overreaching. For one
thing, the journalists' most-cited source, retired Admiral Thomas
Moorer, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from mid-1970
to mid-1974, is 87, lives in an assisted-care retirement home in
Maryland, and is no longer relied on by CNN's military
correspondents. And many of the answers he gave were to
hypothetical questions.

USB DEVICES ARE COOL, THAT IS, IF YOU CAN FIND ONE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you bought a personal computer in the past 12-18 months,
chances are that machine has at least one Universal Serial Bus
port, which is a new and, in theory, better way of connecting
devices to the system.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, as is always the case with new technology, is:
``Why should I care?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the dawn of the IBM PC, users have gotten along just fine
with two basic ways of hooking things up _ the serial and parallel
ports. The problem with both of these port standards is that they
are dumb and slow.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Serial Bus, or USB, is supposed to fix that. It's
very fast, able to transmit data at speeds up to 12 megabits per
second. And it's relatively smart _ you can plug in a USB device
while a computer is on and it will be recognized instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98, released June 25, has built-in support for USB. And
the OSR2 version of Windows 95 can support USB with a software
add-on that's either on many new PCs or is available as a download
from Microsoft's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So if USB has been around for almost a year and a half, and
Windows has been able to support it for almost that long, why isn't
the Universal Serial Bus ... well, universal?
</P>
<P>
   There are two issues here.
</P>
<P>
   First, USB support in Windows 95 was a bit rough around the
edges. While it works, it's not as smooth as it should be. Windows
98 fixes that problem, because USB support is not an add-on; it's
built into the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the companies that make devices that would plug into a
USB port are playing a chicken-or-egg game. They don't want to
start pumping out USB devices until they see more public
acceptance. But public acceptance won't come until consumers see
plenty of USB devices that fill their needs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Intel Corp. in its early promotion of USB used to
cite Iomega's Zip drive as the perfect device to benefit from the
port's abilities. There's just one problem: Iomega executives say
they have no plans to introduce a USB version of the Zip until
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing with some new USB devices on a computer, and I
have to admit that the technology is pretty cool. Yes, you can plug
a USB component into your computer while the machine is running
and, yes, Windows will install the drivers for it automagically.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Just because you have the drivers installed for a device doesn't
mean it will work. A driver is a small software program that acts
as go-between for the computer and the device. You usually need a
more sophisticated software package to coax the device into
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some USB peripherals are simple enough that you can indeed
plug-and-go.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's new Natural Keyboard Elite _ a more compact version
of its popular ergonomic keyboard _ comes with both a PS/2 and USB
plug. When you use the latter, Windows finds the drivers, installs
them and you're ready to type.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has a USB version of its Intellimouse, which has
a wheel _ situated between the left and right buttons _ that is
designed for scrolling through documents. Plug it in, and you can
immediately begin mousing. However, the wheel won't work until you
install a control panel that activates it and other additional
features.
</P>
<P>
   USB is being highly touted for use with scanners and digital
cameras. One of the features of Windows 98 is a built-in
image-receiving and -editing program called Imaging for Windows,
which was developed by Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   I tried Storm Technologies' new PageScan USB. Plug it in, and
you can immediately begin using it with the built-in software. But
Imaging for Windows is rudimentary _ if you want to do more, you'll
have to install the suite of software that comes with the Page- &QL; 
Scan.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the USB aspect works fine, but the supporting software
still gives you fits.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Intel's Create &AMP; Share Camera Pack for USB requires
a full suite of software to operate, even though Windows also loads
quite a few drivers when the camera is first plugged in. The camera
uses this software to grab still images and record video with
sound. Without the package, the hardware is useless.
</P>
<P>
   Although I had no problems with the USB aspect, my entire system
froze during the first reboot after installing all that software.
Only after downloading an update to the software did it work
flawlessly. So much for plug-and-play.

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO FIX PROBLEM WITH PROCOMM FOR DOS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: You may have missed when you swung at the problem in your
June 26 Help Line answer concerning the user with the Procomm for
DOS problem. Procomm Plus for DOS will not run on a Pentium
200-megahertz or faster machine. Datastorm has a fix for the
problem at support.qdeck.com/files/fd2up0001.exe.html. This takes
you to a description page of the fix and a link to download the fix
itself. The page says to use the fix only for 200-megahertz Pentium
systems, but in its user group Quarterdeck says it works on
anything 200 megahertz and faster. Another fix is a utility called
MoSlo which will slow your computer to under 200 megahertz so
Procomm works without the patch. You can set it so when you run
Procomm, your system slows, then speeds back up when you exit. The
utility can also slow your system for older, speed-dependent games.
You can get a free copy at www.hpaa.com or spend $20 for the deluxe
version.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thanks for the information. However, I'll stick with my
suggestion that he move to a Windows-based version of Procomm. It
has more features, is easier and doesn't require crippling the
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have read and saved your June 5 Help Line regarding the
naming of a Web site. I have created a brochure in Publisher 98 and
am in the process of converting it to HTML.
</P>
<P>
   Now my confusion. The company at which I work has an America
Online address and we have five mail boxes. When we build our Web
site and must give it a name, we had hopes of naming the site with
our company's name _ ourcompany.com. Your column suggests that the
only option open to us, namewise, is members.aol.com/ourcompany.
This name is cumbersome, to say the least, and not easily
remembered. If we use this service, is this the only option open to
us for a naming of the site? That leads to a second question
regarding the name: How do others (companies located worldwide)
access our Web site? In other words, what do they type in to read
about the services we offer? If they were to type in the
``search/find'' area some words, for example, ``technology
licensing chemical engineering,'' would we be one of the
suggestions listed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The America Online feature I described was its free Web
hosting service, available to all subscribers. However, if you are
a business and are willing to pay for more, you can get your own
Internet domain name and have it hosted by AOL. Do a keyword
PRIMEHOST to find out more.
</P>
<P>
   As far as others finding your Web site, you can start the
marketing process by adding it to search engines, such as Yahoo!,
Lycos, AltaVista and Hotbot. Each has a page that lets you enter
information about your site, though when it is posted varies. In
some cases, it may not get posted at all _ for example, Yahoo! can
be very selective about what is included in its indices.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the search engines themselves have automated
software robots that scour the Web in search of pages to add to
their databases. Of course, your page must be linked to another
page to be found.
</P>
<P>
   There are several sites on the Web that will take a Web site
listing submission and automate its transmission to multiple search
engines, usually for a fee. You can also download software that
will do it from your computer, such as at www.submissions.com. Some
Web site developers will also do this for you as part of their fee.
</P>
<P>
   You can place certain words on your home page that will cause it
to be pulled in a Web search. If you think potential customers will
use the words ``technology licensing chemical engineering,'' then
add them to the page. You can also add keywords that appear only in
your main page's source code to attract searches.

JOBS REPORT FOR JUNE SHOWS GROWTH IS MODERATING

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hot U.S. economy is showing signs of cooling, but by only a
few degrees. In June, the Labor Department reported Thursday,
unemployment edged up to 4.5 percent, and job growth slowed.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs of moderation. Total hours worked were
virtually flat in June, a clear indication that the nation's output
of goods and services is growing much more slowly than in recent
quarters. And hourly pay rose by a mere penny, suggesting that wage
inflation, while higher than a year ago, was not accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown, however, is from an exceptionally torrid pace.
Payrolls grew by 205,000 last month, compared with more than
300,000 in each of the two previous months.
</P>
<P>
   By any historic standard, job creation remains robust and
unemployment is very low indeed. As recently as a year ago,
joblessness stood at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming after such phenomenal numbers, the June number looks
weaker,'' said Jeffrey Frankel, a member of the Council for
Economic Advisers. ``But on some objective scale, its very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The drag on the job market and the economy mostly reflects a
production slowdown in manufacturing as well as a temporary decline
in government jobs. Manufacturing payrolls, which have been flat to
down for months, fell by 29,000 in June, after dropping by 22,000
in May. The culprits: a superabundance of inventories, the initial
effects of the strike against General Motors and other labor
strife, and deepening economic woes in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere hiring was robust. The giant service sector, from
consulting firms and investment banks to hotel chains and shopping
malls, continued to scoop up workers, as did the temporary-help
industry, usually a harbinger of future job creation. Indeed, as
Katherine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
noted, hiring by the private sector matched the average pace for
the past 12 months _ an exceptionally good stretch for job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took the report in stride. They nudged bond prices
higher but pushed stock prices down modestly. Investors have been
fretting that continued strength in the labor market would prompt
the Federal Reserve to slow the economy by raising rates. Despite
the slowdown, investors and traders are aware that employers are
still creating jobs at a much faster pace than the Federal Reserve
is comfortable with or that would prevent the unemployment rate
from falling further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job growth is slowing to a more comfortable pace, but it's
still not within Alan Greenspan's preferred range,'' said M. Carey
Leahey, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a
consulting firm. The Fed chairman's comfort zone, as he pointedly
hinted in testimony last October, is closer to 100,000 than
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Labor Department officials cautioned against reading too
much into the increase in unemployment. June is the month in which
millions of students in search of summer jobs temporarily join the
labor force, an influx that often results in weird gyrations in
employment and unemployment as measured in the department's survey
of households. Last June, for example, the unemployment rate also
ticked up two-tenths of 1 percent, without signaling an upward
trend in joblessness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And business executives do not see much slackening in the demand
for workers, young or old. ``I dont see any weakness in the labor
market,'' said Mitchell Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower Inc.
Manpower's survey of employers' hiring plans for July through
September shows further expansion. The National Federation of
Independent Business, meanwhile, reported in its June survey that a
record 31 percent of small companies have job openings that they
are unable to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a third of June's decline in manufacturing jobs reflected
the initial effects of the General Motors strike, which has now
idled more than 160,000 workers. The jobs report survey was taken
the week of June 12, when 3,000 GM workers were on strike and
another 6,000 others had been furloughed. If the strike lasts
through mid-July, as many expect, the July employment report will
be sharply affected.
</P>
<P>
   The deepening crisis in Asia, which has strengthened the dollar
and battered demand, also hurt factory employment last month in
several industries that sell to Asian customers or compete with
Asian rivals. Payrolls were down by 1,000 in heavy machinery, 6,000
in apparel and 4,000 in electronic components, where there was also
a strike. The weakness could well continue; in a separate report,
the Commerce Department said that factory orders fell a sharp 1.6
percent in May after rising seven-tenths of 1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in government payrolls, especially at the state and
local level, in June was probably temporary. To be sure, the
federal civil service has been shrinking for years and will no
doubt continue. But a transit strike in Philadephia accounted for a
dip in state jobs. And June is the month that hundreds of thousands
of teachers go on summer break; the timing always changes a bit
from year to year, so attempts to make seasonal adjustments in the
data are rarely perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want to read too much into that decline,'' said
Tom Nardone, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
``Outside of manufacturing and government, things look pretty good.
Things are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Builders added 20,000 more carpenters, bricklayers and the like;
they likely would have added more if it hadn't been for heavy rains
in the Midwest last month. And the services juggernaut _ data
processing, consulting, engineering, health care, health supply,
temporary help, retail, finance, insurance, real estate, trucking,
wholesale trade, utilities _ added 215,000 net payroll jobs.
</P>
<P>
   How much the economy will slow is a matter of great debate among
forecasters. So far, consumers and businesses are continuing to
spend freely while industry is putting the brakes on production.
The question is whether the production cutbacks will continue long
enough to bring job creation to a crawl and to rein in spending, or
whether spending will stay strong enough to eventually revive
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the issue,'' said William Dudley, chief economist at
Goldman Sachs. ``Nobody knows for sure. It depends on how long the
production weakness lasts.'' One damper that seems to be correcting
itself faster than expected is the inventory pile up; Thursday's
Department of Commerce report showed that manufacturers'
inventories hardly grew in May.

CORVETTE: NOW THAT'S AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No modern car on the American road is more red-white-and-blue
blooded than the Chevrolet Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as a 1953 model, it was America's first true,
mass-produced sports car. It was America's answer, as well, to the
pint-size roadsters that were being imported from Europe or shipped
home by GIs stationed there after World War II who had discovered
their lithe, open-air charms.
</P>
<P>
   And the Corvette remains the only American sports car to stand
the test of time. A million-plus Corvettes have been built in more
than four decades, more than any other sports car ever.
</P>
<P>
   Redesigned for the 1997 model year, only the fifth major remake
of the car, the Corvette remains an instantly recognizable American
icon worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The black Corvette convertible, new for 1998, had just landed in
my driveway for a test drive when the school bus arrived. From
inside my house, I could hear the cheers and howls of the
neighborhood boys as they flocked around the car.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the most recent redesign stole some styling cues
from foreign sports cars, including the much-higher-priced,
Japanese-made Acura NSX. These boys knew this was a Corvette, and
they knew what it stood for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop the hood,'' they commanded, and they set to discussing the
Corvette's huge 5.7-liter V8, which delivers 345 horsepower and a
maximum of 350 foot-pounds of torque. ``Take us for a ride,'' they
begged, as they helped me drop the easy-to-operate manual top.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, was anxious for my first drive in the Corvette
convertible. I had already driven the coupe, which has removable
roof panels; it was the first of the new Vettes redesigned for the
1997 model year to reach the market. The convertible followed, and
a hardtop coupe is scheduled to be rolled out in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of my test drive was ideal. Summer had arrived
seemingly overnight. With the sun blazing down on us, I headed east
with a friend across the northern suburbs of Detroit, aiming to
find an open-air restaurant on the St. Clair River for a Friday
night dinner.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was temporarily cured of his notion that Americans are
sensory deprived because they gaze into computer screens all day,
touch mostly plastic and insulate themselves in their cars, homes
and offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Corvette convertible provides enough sensory sensation to
last a long while. Detouring from the rush-hour madness onto a
winding, unpaved road, we inhaled the fragrance of the flowering
plants, felt the rush of the breeze and reveled in the powerful
rumble under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   The Corvette's rigid body structure emitted not a single shake
over the gravel surface, a significant accomplishment for a
convertible, and particularly for a Corvette convertible. Despite
the open top and fiberglass one feels surprisingly safe and snug
inside the Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   The car's sturdy structure also greatly enhances the ride, which
is extraordinarily comfortable for a sports car. We could easily
have gone on for miles after our evening-long drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Corvette behaves like an obedient soldier, hugging corners
and curves without deviation unless commanded to do so and steering
as directed with rifle-sharp precision.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the feeling one gets in some sports cars, one doesn't
feel cramped. In fact, the Corvette's interior space has been
expanded by mounting the transmission _ either the standard
four-speed automatic or the optional six-speed manual _ in the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   Back on a paved surface, we wound out the Corvette's powerful
engine _ somewhat. The only safe place to truly experience the
Corvette's raw power is on a race course or test track, which I had
done earlier. Raw power has long been a hallmark of the Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the safe and secure feeling is the Corvette's optional
active-handling system, available for the first time on 1998 models
for an extra $500.
</P>
<P>
   The car's stability enhancement system prevents the back end
from fishtailing and spinning the car wildly out of control by
selectively applying individual brakes to set the car back on
course. In contrast to other stability-enhancement systems on
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Cadillac cars, the Corvette system allows
the driver to turn it on and off.
</P>
<P>
   Such innovation is nothing new for Corvette, which has a
reputation for cutting-edge technology, including the use of
fiberglass and plastic. Many of its ideas have become commonplace
in more mainstream cars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The newest Corvette also adds another element missing from many
sports cars: practicality. Chevrolet designers and engineers have
eliminated the annoyances that made living day-to-day with the
Corvette difficult. For instance, climbing in and out of the car,
once difficult to do gracefully, is no big deal now.
</P>
<P>
   The roomy trunk, large enough for luggage or a couple of golf
bags, is a significant improvement, too. With traction control and
active handling, the Corvette could easily serve as a year-round,
everyday car instead of a weekend cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   So what is there to complain about? Not much. The back of the
passenger seat rattled a bit, but most sports cars are far from
perfect _ the little flaws add to a car's character. Indeed, sports
cars like the Acura NSX are criticized for being too perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively speaking, the Corvette represents the good old
American tradition of value as well. Base prices start at $38,560
with destination fees; the convertible opens at $44,990, and the
fully loaded, topless test model topped out at just over $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of money but a bargain compared with the price of
the only other true American sports car, the Dodge Viper, which
starts at $65,000 and is far less practical than the Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans must agree. Even before the strikes by the United
Automobile Workers began a month ago, the assembly plant in Bowling
Green, Ky., could barely keep up with demand. The plant is now
closed because of the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Corvette is the best Corvette ever and the best
American sports car on the market. It represents the greatest of
American virtues: power, strength, endurance and value.
</P>
<P>
   And, without a top, it offers the feeling of good, old American
freedom.

ASTRONOMERS SAY THEY HAVE FOUND A NEW CLASS OF ASTEROID 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers at the University of Hawaii have discovered an
asteroid that they believe represents a hitherto undetected type, a
type that could hit Earth without warning.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release distributed Thursday, Dr. David Tholen and a
graduate student, Robert Whiteley, reported that the asteroid
circles the sun entirely within Earth's orbit. All other known
Earth-approaching asteroids travel in orbits that lie at least
partly outside Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers calculated that 1998 DK36, as the asteroid was
designated, is about 40 yards in diameter, and that if it hit Earth
it would have about the same effect as that of the asteroid that
exploded above the Tunguska River in Siberia in 1908, flattening a
vast tract of forest.
</P>
<P>
   Tholen said that 1998 DK36 posed no apparent threat to Earth,
but that an asteroid orbit entirely within Earth's orbit opened the
possibility that dangerous asteroids might exist where astronomers
did not normally look for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All other efforts to discover asteroids on a collision course
with the Earth are being directed at a region of the sky almost
opposite the sun,'' Tholen said. ``The significance of this
discovery is that we would have otherwise never found this new
asteroid because it apparently doesn't travel to that region of the
sky.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Gareth Williams of the Central Bureau for Astronomical
Telegrams in Cambridge, Mass., cast doubt on the assertion that the
asteroid orbits the sun entirely within Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That orbital calculation was based on just two brief
observations of the object, one lasting seven minutes on the night
of Feb. 23, and the other on Feb. 24 for four minutes,'' Williams
said. ``Of the solutions we plotted, some showed the asteroid's
orbit to be entirely within the Earth's orbit, but others showed
part of the orbit outside the Earth's orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the asteroid, which was on the far side of the sun, was
difficult using the Mauna Kea telescope, Williams said, because of
its angular proximity to the sun; only a few minutes were available
for observations. He said the announcement about the asteroid ``was
a bit premature.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Tholen said, ``1998 DK36 is nothing to lose sleep
over. It's the ones we haven't found that are of concern.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Residents scramble to save belongings amid evacuations
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORMOND BEACH, Fla. _ Like happy Florida retirees, Vonnie Brown
Evanoff and her husband, Bob, rode their bicycles to a neighborhood
meeting Wednesday night, hoping to learn what to do if the
wildfires that have plagued their area got too close.
</P>
<P>
   They never made it to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came swarming out of there telling us there was a
mandatory evacuation and we better get out,'' said Mrs. Evanoff, a
longtime Atlanta resident who moved to the upscale Breakaway Trails
subdivision here seven months ago. ``We only had a half hour to
throw some clothes in the car and go.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple joined nearly 30,000 other residents of Flagler,
Volusia and Brevard counties along Florida's Atlantic coast driven
from their homes as brisk west winds fanned the fires late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The winds continued Thursday, and few residents were allowed
back into their neighborhoods. Many went to stay with family or
friends, checked into local motels or went to shelters opened at
area schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Evanoffs were allowed back into their development to check
on their home Thursday morning, but within minutes were ordered out
again as nearby flames flared anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I got out was my mother's cedar chest, my jewelry, some
papers and some of Bob's collector guns,'' she said. ``I had to
have that cedar chest. It has my mother and father's name inscribed
on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also gathered a few photographs, but had to leave
many behind, including some of Mrs. Evanoff's first husband, who
died several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They spent much of Thursday afternoon standing in a church
parking lot a half-mile from the entrance to their neighborhood,
watching as helicopters swooped low over two ponds, filling giant
buckets hanging on slings. The airships then swooped away to the
line of pine trees where dense smoke choked the air, dropping the
water and then heading back to the ponds for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really scares you watching that,'' Mrs. Evanoff said. ``But
you don't want to risk your life for anything material. It doesn't
look too good right now. If it jumps that road, we're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Two miles away, Joseph Ramsey pulled up to a grocery store
parking lot, his Chevy van loaded with clothes and other personal
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Ramsey bought a secluded piece of Florida
paradise, purchasing an old wood-frame home in the midst of a
gorgeous stand of water oaks. A posh neighborhood grew up around
him over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost lost the place in the fires of 1985,'' he said.
``Flames came within a few feet of the house. This time we're
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Althea, packed their belongings, but waited out
the fires Wednesday night, not wanting to load four dogs_three of
them Great Danes_and six cats and go searching for a shelter or a
motel that would accommodate the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a sprinkler on the roof and stayed up all night,'' he
said. ``Today the fire is still two or three miles from our house,
but the wind is blowing it in our direction. If this wind keeps up,
there's a good chance it could make it to us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evanoffs spent Wednesday night in a motel, and didn't sleep
much either.

<P>
   ``Bob had the radio things in his ears all night,'' Mrs. Evanoff
said. ``We turned off the TV about 1 a.m., but couldn't really
sleep. It was just fitful sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Evanoff, 51, called her children in Atlanta to tell them
she was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't think to tell them to call my three sisters,''
she said. ``When we got to the house this morning, there was
frantic message from one of my sisters, telling me, 'Call me
immediately when you get this message.'''
</P>
<P>
   The couple weren't sure how long they would have to stay out of
their home, but with fires burning on both the north and south
sides of their development, it could be days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I just wish I was in Atlanta,'' Mrs. Evanoff said.

   SARASOTA
</P>
<P>
   Wanted: some fire over here: While fires ravage much of the
state, burning homes and closing highways, officials at Myakka
River State Park in Sarasota can only sigh wistfully and wish they
had a little of that.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials are working to restore some habitats _ dry
prairies and pine flatwoods _ that existed before human
intervention. When those habitats are restored, park officials hope
to attract native species such as the crested caracara, the
burrowing owl and the gopher tortoise.
</P>
<P>
   But those habitats depend for their health and stability on
regular fires, park biologist Belinda Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire in Florida comes naturally during the lightning season,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, grasslands turn to woods, different species take up
residence, and the natural ecosystem is altered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the statewide ban on burning, park officials have
not been allowed to set the fires they normally would have set. And
when nature has cooperated and lightning has ignited fires in the
park, officials, contrary to their desires, have had to put them
out.
</P>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL
</P>
<P>
   Space station threatened: NASA engineers grew increasingly
concerned Thursday about the effects of wildfires on the ``clean
rooms'' where modules of the new international space station are
waiting to be launched into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires raged about 10 miles away from the Kennedy Space
Center, where visibility was reduced to 1 1/2 miles because of the
thick smoke and falling ash, said Bruce Buckingham, NASA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   So far, filters and air handlers protecting the clean rooms have
managed to cope with the airborne debris, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is burning on the base yet, but there is concern
because we have 100,000 acres here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The space center is part of a national wildlife refuge full of
pine forests, scrub bushes and marshland and hundreds of species of
wildlife. But most of the base is separated from the mainland fires
by the Indian River.
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Go away sunshine: Tourism officials in Daytona Beach usually
pray for cloudless, sunny days around the time of the NASCAR race.
But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the one year they don't want sunshine, guess what they're
getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had three bright, beautiful days and there's no rain
predicted until Monday, which normally would be ideal for us _ but
not with this fire,'' said Blaine Lansberry, marketing vice
president for Oceans 11 Resorts, which operates five hotels in
Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Lansberry advised tourists to postpone their visits to the
Daytona area until next week.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Oceans 11 hotels _ the Bahama House, Acapulco Inn,
Trans Island Inn, Beachcomer Inn and, in Ormond Beach, Casa del Mar
_ were booked solid this weekend, 90 percent with racing fans. Even
though the race has been canceled, many still are occupying their
rooms, since I-95, the main route out of Daytona, has been
closedbecause of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lansberry said, ``This is a huge disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ORMAND BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Smoke on the water: The specter of wildfires was no reason for
some tourists to cancel vacations.
</P>
<P>
   While flames drove residents from their homes not far away,
beachgoers ignored smoky, sunless skies and ashes that washed up on
shore to play in the sand or look for seashells.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to overlook it, otherwise you would have to pack and
go home,'' said Victor Adkison of Tyler, Texas, who built a sand
castle with his 9-year-old son on Ormond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still down here,'' Adkison said. ``It can't always be
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   MIMS
</P>
<P>
   Lawn ornaments threatened: Real pets take precedence over fake
ones sometimes, even when the fake ones took years to make.
</P>
<P>
   At Whirligig World near Mims, a place that sells colorful lawn
ornaments, Norman Carter gazed forlornly at his wooden turtles,
raccoons and Mickey Mouses. Their legs and arms whirled comically
in the breeze as though the creatures wanted to flee the fires en
masse.
</P>
<P>
   Carter spent years making these things. Now they seem doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've packed as many as we can, but we don't have room for all
of them,'' he said. ``We packed important things like our pets,
important papers and money. We're just keeping our eyes open and
hoping it doesn't get any closer.''

JURY REACHES MIXED VERDICT ON FRAUD TRIAL OF FREEMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILLINGS, Mont. _ A federal jury on Thursday convicted the
leadership of the anti-government Freemen movement of a series of
charges, largely financial fraud, but was unable to reach verdicts
on several other counts including the conspiracy charge that is at
the core of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Coughenour of U.S. District Court here refused to
declare a mistrial on the 11 deadlocked counts of the 41-count
indictment and ordered the jury to return to the courthouse on
Tuesday to resume deliberation of the undecided counts. The jury
also found three of the defendants not guilty on two charges each.
</P>
<P>
   Capping four days of deliberations, the jury also convicted
LeRoy Schweitzer, portrayed by prosecutors as the mastermind of the
group, Daniel Peterson, the group's treasurer, and Richard Clark of
two counts of threatening to kill Montana's chief federal judge,
Jack Shanstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer was convicted on 21 counts involving phony financial
instruments. The jury found Peterson guilty on four fraud-related
counts, Russell Landers on three, Dale Jacobi and Rodney Skurdal on
two each, and Clark on one.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charge that the Freemen wrote 3,432 ``checks,'' with
a total face value of $15.5 billion, using the number of a Norwest
Bank account that never contained more than $116.
</P>
<P>
   With 92 witnesses and five weeks of testimony, the trial offered
glimpses into the Freemen's secretive world of financial fraud and
violence. A radical anti-government group with racist elements, the
Freemen caught the nation's attention in the spring of 1996 during
an 81-day FBI siege of their ranch compound in Jordan, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed after two years in jail, nine of the defendants
boycotted the trial, refusing even to talk to their lawyers, and
seven of them have spent the last two weeks in a prison hospital in
Springfield, Mo., following two hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   John McGuire, the only defendant to testify at the trial, argued
that the federal court had no jurisdiction over him and that he had
not committed any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for other defendants argued that their clients sincerely
believed that the phony checks printed by Freemen on home computers
were genuine. They charged that the FBI falsely encouraged the
Freemen when an undercover agent told them he cashed their checks
and used the money to buy a copier, computer and radio system for
the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The two women defendants, Agnes Stanton and Cherlyn Petersen,
attended the trial. Their lawyers used what one lawyer called the
``gofer defense,'' alleging that they were merely following their
husbands' instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the prosecution testimony tried to prove that the
Freemen's central activity in Jordan was to try to pass bogus
financial instruments as real.
</P>
<P>
   Printed from a home computer, these ``checks'' carried
impressive sounding names: ``documentary draft,'' ``lien draft,''
``comptroller warrant, ``certified money order,'' and ``certified
banker's check.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``checks'' went out to 1,004 recipients in about half the
states of the nation, investigators said. The problem was so severe
that the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency issued four worldwide
alerts to the financial community from October 1994 until the FBI
placed the Freemen compound under siege in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worthless junk'' was how Judge Coughenour described the
checks. He warned defense lawyers not to portray the checks as
genuine, adding they could say only that the defendants believed
them to be genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Even though less than 1 percent of their checks were honored,
the Freemen managed to accumulate a small fortune; $144,000 in
cash, plus a small hoard of money orders and gold and silver coins.
</P>
<P>
   Stored in a small wooden box, the cash and coins were smuggled
out of the compound in the early days of the siege, testified Ebert
Stanton, a former Freeman, whose parents, Agnes and William, were
on trial here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that the trial would draw crowds of right-wingers,
fewer than a dozen supporters appeared here during the trial. In
late May, several men came here from the Pacific Northwest in
response to an Internet appeal for militia members to ``intercede''
in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   One Freeman supporter, Jacob Miller of Florida, was expelled
from the courtroom for studying the jury with binoculars, and one
death threat against the judge was reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An FBI firearms examiner testified that the Freemen's arsenal in
Jordan held 23 handguns, 67 rifles, 10 shotguns and more than
40,000 rounds of ammunition, including 182 rounds of armor-piercing
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   A series of witnesses testified that they threatened to kidnap,
put on trial and execute a host of local officials. Witnesses said
the Freemen also offered $1 million bounties for the capture or
death of the lead FBI investigator and a federal judge who had
issued a foreclosure order against a farm owned by two of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Canady, the lead FBI agent in the case, testified that
fear of provoking bloodshed prevented the bureau from arresting the
Freemen when they shifted operations from Roundup, Mont., to Jordan
in September 1995. In addition, the FBI seems to have used the
Freemen as bait to amass intelligence information on the militia
movement during a yearlong surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The delay not only caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in
fraud losses to businesses victimized by Freemen checks but also
caused deep resentment among the Freemen's rural neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the June 2 Republican primaries, voters in Garfield and
Musselshell Counties rejected their sheriffs, men who had become
associated with the go-slow policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hands were tied to working with the FBI,'' said Charles
Phipps, the Garfield County sheriff who plans to run as a write-in
candidate in November. ``We could have gone out, got in a gun
fight, shot somebody, then be in lawsuits for the rest of our
lives. People didn't understand that.'' &QL;

JURY REACHES MIXED VERDICT ON FRAUD TRIAL OF FREEMEN

VERBAL ABUSE IN '93 CLASH NOT FROM OREL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Sidebar to Hershiser story) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In one of the many ironic twists of Dodgers-Giants
lore, Orel Hershiser emerged as the No. 1 villain in the Bay Area
at a time when he was trying to quell a blaze of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   A simple case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1993 season, San Francisco and the Atlanta
Braves were deadlocked in a fight for the NL West title, but the
also-ran Dodgers, in their season finale, routed the Giants 12-1 at
Dodger Stadium to knock them out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Later, San Francisco third baseman Matt Williams singled out
Hershiser as a player who had been taunting the Giants unmercifully
from the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser says he had climbed to the top step of the dugout
precisely to silence the magpies on his team. The Giants saw him,
heard the voice of Dodgers rookie Jerry Brooks behind him, and
fused the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred (Claire) and Tommy (Lasorda) gave a huge pep talk before
the game about how many times the Giants knocked the Dodgers out of
the playoff race, and how this series has always been huge. But
you've got the 40-man roster up, not just the regular 25 guys, so
all of these kids are just on fire,'' Hershiser said this week.
``They're ragging (verbally abusing the Giants).
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to let it go a little bit because Tommy inspired it
all. ... But during a (Giants) pitching change, guys started
yelling from the field to our dugout, from our dugout to the field.
And I just stood up on the top step in front of our guys, as if to
say, `I don't want anymore.' I looked over my shoulder and gave our
guys dirty glares. And Matt and Robby T. (Thompson) and a bunch of
the guys on the infield thought I was the one doing the yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser later called Williams to sort out the entire affair.
The two later were locker mates in Cleveland and laugh over the
story today.
</P>
<P>
   But passions aren't always cooled as readily among Giants
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, said Hershiser, ``all of a sudden I'm the worst
person ever to wear a Dodger uniform. The fans remember it. There
are fans out there who will go to their grave thinking I was the
jerk.''

MIKE-ROSCOPIC MEDDLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Man, how wise can it be to put a mike in the hands of a Mike
Weisman?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Joe Torre doesn't agree, but the folks in charge of Fox
baseball aren't about to cut the juice.
</P>
<P>
   This season, it's been the modus operandi of producer Weisman to
find another nontraditional way to tweak the Fox Saturday
game-of-the-week telecast with wireless microphones and/or
hand-held cameras.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for Saturday's Dodgers-Giants broadcast from 3Com
Park, Weisman sought and received permission from Orel Hershiser to
put a mike on the pitcher in the San Francisco dugout and get his
commentary (to be taped and used judiciously). That would have been
another Weisman broadcast first _ no one outside of a manager or
coach has ever worn audio equipment during a real game. But
Thursday afternoon, before leaving for the Bay Area from his home
in Brentwood, Weisman was informed he couldn't do it because it
needed approval from the MLBPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'll do it another time,'' said Weisman, who wants to hook
Tom Lasorda up with a mike in the stands for some live, impromptu
fillibustering.
</P>
<P>
   For Weisman, a nonoral Orel is a small bump in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned by Fox baseball coordinating producer John Filipelli to
oversee one of the four regional Saturday telecasts with the Thom
Brenneman-Bob Brenly broadcast team and director Jim Lynch, Weisman
has turned these World Series hors d'oeuvres into midseason treats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Good Lord wanted to create a baseball producer, he
started with Michael Weisman,'' said Filipelli, who Weisman hired
as the lead baseball producer at NBC some 15 years ago and has
returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Back as a hands-on producer, Weisman's baseball broadcasts are
part ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' part ``Pop-up Video.''
Yet they're 100 percent Weisman, who once had the media-created
nickname ``Mad Mike'' when he did particularly innovative things
for NBC Sports as its boy-wonder executive producer during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved the way Letterman broke down the wall
between the TV camera and the audience,'' said Weisman. ``Doing
games for Fox, I've been able to live out some sports TV
fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as:
</P>
<P>
   _During a Chicago Cubs-Atlanta Braves game, Weisman sent
cameraman David Benzer from his normal dugout spot in the fourth
inning and had him go onto Weyland Avenue, beyond the left-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman's thinking: We've seen all kinds of TV pictures of a
ball hit out of the park and onto that street. Why not have a live
camera capture the flight of the ball as it comes right into the TV
viewers' laps?
</P>
<P>
   With a glove on his left hand, the camera on his right shoulder
and a wireless mike so he could talk on the air to Brenneman and
Brenly, the burly Benzer went out there and waited.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get a chance to catch a ball with his glove (or lens),
but Benzer ended up talking to a father and son who were playing
stickball against the outside of the Wrigley Field wall.
</P>
<P>
   _During a recent Dodgers-Rockies game at Dodger Stadium, Weisman
put a mike on Roger Owens, the famed peanut vendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no interest in mikeing (then manager) Bill Russell,''
said Weisman, ``frankly because baseball is slow enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Without telling Owens when he'd be on camera, Weisman used him
as an escape hatch for some levity during an otherwise one-sided
game. Weisman's reward was some priceless live footage of Owens
bantering with the customers (even though much didn't make it on
the air).
</P>
<P>
   _During a Rangers-Giants telecast last week, Weisman put a
microphone on one of the 3Com Park ``ball dudes,'' the 70-something
gentlemen who sit in uniform down the left- and right-field lines
to retrieve foul balls. The result was something like Letterman
doing a live remote with Larry ``Bud'' Mellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is some of this stuff sophomoric? Yes,'' said Weisman. ``Are
we doing it to amuse ourselves in the truck? Yes. Do the people at
home enjoy it? I'm not sure, but my rationale has always been to at
least try, make it fresh. With this crew (Breneman and Brenly), we
can do almost anything we want.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Weisman doesn't know when to shut up. The irony
is that the guy who won 15 Emmy Awards in 11 years from '78 to '89
with NBC as either producer or executive producer on the '88 Summer
Olympics, eight World Series, seven Super Bowls and numerous
Wimbledon and French Open tennis tournaments was also the one who
came up with the ``silent minute'' during the pregame show of Super
Bowl XX.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if Fox doesn't keep an eye on him, either. It
was the Yankees-Red Sox game last year that Weisman was producing
when miked manager Torre's expletive was inexplicably aired after a
key Paul O'Neill home run. Although the blunder occurred because
the audio man rewound the tape about three seconds too far, Weisman
took full responsibility. He issued an apology on air, then
personally apologized to the irate Torre, who had to be persuaded
by Weisman to wear the mike in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The New York media actually backed Weisman for the mistake since
he apologized to Torre (who wouldn't accept it) and for Fox's
attempt at add a little life to some otherwise stagnant midseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``More times than not, I think that no one blames you as long as
you're trying,'' said Weisman. ``I'm glad more producers haven't
caught on to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports TV can be such a copycat business. The material is
often the same, but it's in how you present it.''

TOP 100 FILMS: FOREIGN FLAVOR TASTES BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: UPDATED VERSION OF FOREIGN. with LIST100) I used to
tell people my top-10 list had 40 movies on it. It's a common
problem. We all like to make lists, but there's never enough room.
</P>
<P>
   So when the American Film Institute recently decided to list the
hundred greatest films, they restricted it to American films _ or
at least they say they did. Somehow, a few English films made the
list. But no foreign language films did.
</P>
<P>
   And that leaves us a whole universe of movies not eligible,
including some of the best ever made.
</P>
<P>
   So, this week, in response, we are providing the list of 100
best foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these films are established classics, and if you worry
that the list has too many of the ``usual suspects,'' I hope I have
included enough eccentric personal choices to give everyone
something to talk about. That, after all, is the purpose of such a
list.
</P>
<P>
   The movies on this list were chosen for several reasons. Some
are among the greatest artistic creations of our civilization.
Others are on the list because of their enormous influence on other
filmmakers. Still others are just such fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me, if you think all foreign films are dreary and
boring, you haven't been watching the right ones. Admittedly,
French or German films are more likely to investigate the outer
reaches of alienation and philosophy than Hollywood films, but you
will never find better battle scenes than in Akira Kurosawa's
``Ran.'' You will be hard pressed to find more suspense than in the
last half-hour of Georges-Henri Clouzot's ``Diabolique.'' And if
it's blowing things up you are after, check out Clouzot's ``Wages
of Fear,'' in which Yves Montand and a bunch of toughs drive a
truck full of nitroglycerine 300 miles over unpaved South American
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I don't want to gloss over the difference between American
and foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   I have always made the distinction between what I call
``Hollywood films'' and ``real movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The real movie is about being human, about relationships,
character, moral issues, and historical and philosophical meaning.
Hollywood movies are about blowing things up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are foreign-made Hollywood movies by my definition,
and Hollywood-made real movies: One thinks of spaghetti Westerns on
one hand, and of Francis Ford Coppola's ``The Conversation'' or
John Ford's ``The Searchers'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   At least one film manages to play both sides of the field: AFI's
No. 1 film, ``Citizen Kane'' manages like nothing else I know, to
join seamlessly the slick Hollywood side with the depth and
character development of a ``real movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As critic Pauline Kael has said, it is one of the few great
movies that is also great fun.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, foreign filmmakers play out their creativity
in a larger world, with more possibilities and fewer hidebound
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Hollywood ``earned'' its reputation as the
manufacturer of the shallow happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   My list of the 100-best foreign films is a very personal list,
drawn from a lifetime of watching movies. I expect you have your
own films to nominate. But these are the ones I came up with.
</P>
<P>
   First on my list is ``Children of Paradise,'' which is more like
a full-length novel than any other film I know. It has a rich cast
of characters and follows them over many years. And as in
``Brothers Karamazov,'' each character also embodies a different
philosophy. It is a very full movie.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the Paris of the 1840s, it tells the tale of Baptiste
Debureau and the theatrical world in which he lived. It is also
about love, art and social class.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Kane'' manages to mix high and low successfully, so does
``Children of'' ``Paradise,'' in its own way. It has something of
the sweep of ``Gone With the Wind,'' the passion of ``From Here to
Eternity'' and the wit of ``Ninotchka''.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a film you can grow with rather than out of. When I
was fresh out of college, I identified with the idealistic
Baptiste; after a few marriages, I took the practical Frederick
Lemaitre's attitude toward relationships; nowadays, I uncomfortably
find myself more in the cynical Pierre-Francois Lacenaire.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Renoir's ``Rules of the Game'' might just as well claim the
top spot. No other film is as deft at showing the disjunction
between what our impulses are and what society demands of us.
</P>
<P>
   Cocteau's ``Orphee'' is also a great deal of fun, playing with
all the tricks of cinema to create visual magic. What you see is
likely to remain in your memory forever.
</P>
<P>
   Fellini's ``8{'' begins with the same kind of magic, a dream
sequence that you can't get out of your mind, but it continues on
to be about a film director that doesn't know what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Samurai'' is a pure action film, the model for the
Western, ``The'' ``Magnificent Seven,'' but much, much better. You
actually care about these characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potemkin'' is one of those seminal films that invent the
language of cinema. What is all the more astonishing is that this
Soviet propaganda film actually plays down the more sensational
aspects of the affair. If it had been truer to history, it would
have felt more simply propagandistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Passion of Joan of Arc'' is not the most consistently good
film. It has stretches of languors, but when the camera is on the
face of Maria Falconetti, in the only film she ever made, the
intensity is literally unbearable. It is the face of human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's ``Ran'' is a Japanese retelling of Shakespeare's
``King Lear,'' and shows the director at the absolute peak of his
powers, with the best battle sequences ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Dietrich sings ``Falling in Love Again'' in ``The Blue
Angel,'' which makes ``Cabaret'' look like ``Gidget Goes to the
Weimar Republic.'' Steamy, smoky, atmospheric, its director, Josef
von Sternberg _ an American _ never did anything so good again.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a serious commitment of time and attention to sit
through Andre Tarkovsky's ``Andrei Rublev,'' but you will know you
have experienced something worth your effort, as the director takes
us through a brutal vision of life and the place in it for both art
and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, almost any of the next 25 or 30 could legitimately
make it to the top 10, but I'll stand with the ones I have chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like ``Jules and Jim'' or ``Amarcord'' are pure pleasure
to watch. Others, such as ``Rashomon'' or ``Wild Strawberries''
have at their core a moral vision. And still others, such as ``The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' and ``Metropolis'' are simply visionary.
</P>
<P>
   You will find intensity, passion, intellect, visuals, acting and
directing the equal or better of anything from Hollywood. What you
will not find are giant lizards and serial car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   A few, such as ``Henry V'' and ``The Mahabharata'' are
unabashedly theatrical, using their staginess as a style.
</P>
<P>
   There are few British films on my list: AFI threw me a curve and
included several on its list. So, ``Third Man, Dr. Strangelove''
and ``Lawrence of Arabia'' are not here, although they would have
been.
</P>
<P>
   You will discover that a handful of directors made the majority
of these films. I cannot apologize for that. I made the list
without considering authorship. As it turns out, Ingmar Bergman
shows up a dozen times; Kurosawa, 10. Francois Truffaut and
Federico Fellini follow up with seven and five films.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean Bergman is the greatest director? No. He has made
many great films, but he is more prone to self-parody than any
other important director and when he is bad _ as in the miserable
Elliot Gould film, ``The Touch,'' he comes close to rivaling Ed
Wood.
</P>
<P>
   In art, there is no best. There is only overwhelming. &QL;

HIGHER-LEVEL LAPSES FOUND IN SKI LIFT CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Failures by the Marine Corps and the Air Force to
pass along crucial information cast ``substantial doubt'' on
whether the captain of a plane that struck a ski lift cable in the
Italian Alps in February could be convicted in a court-martial, a
hearing officer found in a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearing officer, Lt. Col. Ronald L. Rodgers, said the
captain of the Marine Corps jet should be tried on the most serious
possible charges in the accident that killed 20 people and caused a
rift between Italy and the United States over prosecution of the
four-man crew.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers made his recommendations after presiding over hearings
in May and in June, when evidence about the accident was presented.
While his report is advisory, it represents an official
acknowledgment of major lapses of people higher in the chain of
command _ many of whom do not face any charges in connection with
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``systemic errors,'' the report detailed numerous
breakdowns in communications within the Marine Corps electronic
warfare squadron to which the plane belonged, within the Air Force
and between those two agencies. It also cited evidence of
``noncriminally negligent pilot behavior.'' The report recommended
a court-martial for the navigator, on a slightly less serious
charge, and no court-martial for two other officers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, stationed at the Aviano air base as part of the
``Deliberate Guard'' mission over Bosnia, was on a low-altitude
training mission in the Alps flown by Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of
Mission Viejo, Calif. Next to him in the cockpit was Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y., who had no flight controls but
planned the mission and handled navigation aloft.
</P>
<P>
   In the rear cockpit of the plane, an EA-6B Prowler, were Capt.
Chandler Seagraves, 28, of Nineveh, Ind., and Capt. William Raney,
27, of Engelwood, Colo. They had no view out the front and only
limited information on the plane's altitude and position.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a Marine Investigation Board recommended charges
against all of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony of Col. Tom Blickensderfer, a board member and
director of operations at the Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry
Point, N.C., where the Prowlers are based, contributed to Rodgers'
conclusions that other factors played a role in the accident.
Blickensderfer said he had ``flown'' a computer-based simulator
over the route as part of the investigation. The terrain, he
testified, would have caused the pilot to see an optical illusion
of greater altitude than was actually the case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rodgers said that ``reasonable grounds exist that support
the conclusion that Ashby was overly aggressive in the execution of
this training mission; that he thereafter failed to take
appropriate steps to determine the safety of his altitude in the
mishap valley, and, that those factors were significant causative
factors in the tragedy which resulted.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was reasonable to argue that ``Captain Ashby placed
himself in the dilemma he confronted.'' Even though the group of
six cables did not appear on his map, he bore down much too fast
and too low to do anything about it, the colonel noted.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers said Ashby should be charged with involuntary
manslaughter, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years
imprisonment. He recommended that Schweitzer, the navigator, be
charged with negligent homicide, which is punishable by up to three
years. Both should also be charged with dereliction of duty, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision rests with Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine
Corps Forces Atlantic in Norfolk, who has authority to determine
what charges, if any, the crew would face at a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said, ``they need somebody to go
to trial,'' because of the international sensitivity of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers put some of the blame on the Air Force, which has units
stationed permanently at Aviano and was supposed to provide
information on local flight rules to the Marine squadrons that came
through on six-month rotations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the flaws enumerated by Rodgers were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Air Force's 31st Fighter Wing created a ``pilot aid''
intended for mission planning and gave copies to the Marines. But
the most current version at the time of the accident did not
mention a 2,000-foot restriction that had taken effect months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   _ The squadron's officer in charge of scheduling missions
photocopied information on flights over Italy, including one with
the 2,000-foot restriction. But ``he apparently never digested its
contents, or the importance thereof,'' the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency that prepared detailed charts of northern Italy
used by the Marines, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency,
copied information on aerial obstructions from an Italian chart
drawn on the scale of 1-250,000. But, Colonel Rodgers said, other
maps, not those, mark aerial obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force received a copy of a map using the scale of
1-500,000, which noted the obstruction, in April 1996, but the 31st
Fighter Wing was unaware of that, the report said.

JURY REACHES MIXED VERDICT ON FRAUD TRIAL OF FREEMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILLINGS, Mont. _ A federal jury on Thursday convicted the
leadership of the anti-government Freemen movement of a series of
charges, largely financial fraud, but was unable to reach verdicts
on several other counts including the conspiracy charge that is at
the core of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Coughenour of U.S. District Court here refused to
declare a mistrial on the 11 deadlocked counts of the 41-count
indictment and ordered the jury to return to the courthouse on
Tuesday to resume deliberation of the undecided counts. The jury
also found three of the defendants not guilty on two charges each.
</P>
<P>
   Capping four days of deliberations, the jury also convicted
LeRoy Schweitzer, portrayed by prosecutors as the mastermind of the
group, Daniel Peterson, the group's treasurer, and Richard Clark of
two counts of threatening to kill Montana's chief federal judge,
Jack Shanstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer was convicted on 21 counts involving phony financial
instruments. The jury found Peterson guilty on four fraud-related
counts, Russell Landers on three, Dale Jacobi and Rodney Skurdal on
two each, and Clark on one.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charge that the Freemen wrote 3,432 ``checks,'' with
a total face value of $15.5 billion, using the number of a Norwest
Bank account that never contained more than $116.
</P>
<P>
   With 92 witnesses and five weeks of testimony, the trial offered
glimpses into the Freemen's secretive world of financial fraud and
violence. A radical anti-government group with racist elements, the
Freemen caught the nation's attention in the spring of 1996 during
an 81-day FBI siege of their ranch compound in Jordan, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed after two years in jail, nine of the defendants
boycotted the trial, refusing even to talk to their lawyers, and
seven of them have spent the last two weeks in a prison hospital in
Springfield, Mo., following two hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   John McGuire, the only defendant to testify at the trial, argued
that the federal court had no jurisdiction over him and that he had
not committed any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for other defendants argued that their clients sincerely
believed that the phony checks printed by Freemen on home computers
were genuine.

 &HT;    Chipper literally blasts out of slump
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ While Andres Galarraga nurses his bruised left
wrist, his bruised left tricep and his bruised back courtesy of
Tampa Bay's pitching staff, the Braves' clean-up hitter may be
pleased to know that someone has returned to hit in the No. 3 slot
ahead of his.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week slump, Chipper Jones has come around this week.
Staggered by a 5-for-41 slide dating back to June 17th, Jones hit
just .122 over an 11-game period and saw his season average dip to
a year-low .300.
</P>
<P>
   But recovered fully now from the flu, Jones may have turned a
corner against Tampa Bay. Surely, it's an expansion pitching staff
but Roberto Hernandez and Rolando Arrojo are not expansion fodder
and he homered off both of them. He finished the series at 6-for-14
with six RBI, three homers and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series, Jones had gone nine games without an
extra-base hit. Wednesday night with his parents and extended
family members in the crowd, he beat the Devil Rays with a
ninth-innning two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to come in here and win three games,'' he said.
``After we struggled in the last few weeks, we've had some injuries
and haven't been able to keep everybody in the lineup at the same
time. This is a big deal for me but I'll take the three wins ahead
of my breaking out of a slump any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux being Greg Maddux, there was not much
self-appreciation in the fact that he threw a complete game for the
fifth time in seven starts. Just like there was not much
significance attatched to his 16th straight road victory. Or his
major-league leading ERA dropping further to 1.54. But with six
complete games already, Maddux has a clear shot at his career-best
(10 in both 1994 and 1995). And given that just one in 16 NL starts
results in a complete game this season, the achievement is
noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says I got to the ninth inning with a low pitch count,''
said Maddux. ``And that's all it says.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz home early
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday starter John Smoltz returned home ahead of the team
Thursday to seek treatment for an aching back that has flared up in
the past few days. Though Smoltz has been prone to back pain in the
past, the right-hander may this time receive a cortisone injection,
now that he has at least a week and probably more before his next
start. Smoltz said the back pain was a response to
over-compensation for his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Survey says . . .
</P>
<P>
   For those scoring at home, Tampa Bay's first baseman was
3-for-12 this series with a double and no RBIs. The Braves first
baseman was 3-for-10 with two home runs and three RBIs, which sums
up the first head-to-head meeting between Fred McGriff and Andres
Galarraga. Devil Rays followers are waiting for McGriff to
reappear. After a sensational April (.349 with six homers and 23
RBI), McGriff homered twice in the past two months with just 18
RBIs.

 &HT;    Galarraga as a target has Braves concerned
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ Andres Galarraga was a little better prepared
this time, outfitted with a new re-enforced guard for his left
elbow to go with the heavily padded glove on his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays hit him anyway. For the third time in
three games _ for the third time in nine plate appearances _
Galarraga was hit by a pitch. Thursday, Rolando Arrojo plunked him
in the back in the sixth inning with a man on base.
</P>
<P>
   The incident did not lead to trouble, but it suggested it. By
the time Greg Maddux drilled the Devil Rays' Rich Butler in the
beltline in the seventh, the mood shifted. And when Tampa Bay
reliever Scott Eldred threw a change-up behind Eddie Perez's back,
this one was one more buzz-ball away from a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they want to throw in on me, but I don't know,''
Galarraga said. ``Sometimes I don't know if it's on purpose or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Larry Rothschild said he thought that Maddux threw
at Butler purposefully, a curious sentiment from a manager whose
team leads the majors in hit batsmen (50). Maddux, by comparison,
has hit 12 batters in his last 670 innings, just two this season.
And while Butler would not debate Maddux's intent, he was grateful
for his pin-point control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was intentional, thank God he didn't throw at my head,''
Butler said, ``because he would have hit me right in the eyeball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Maddux) hit him on purpose,'' said Rothschild, who left the
dugout to debate the point with plate umpire John Shulock. ``And if
he did, he should have been thrown out of the game. My feeling was,
he was hit on purpose. They'll never say it; he'll never say it.
(But) it happens in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Braves afterward were seething, although not for the
record. But the punishment Galaraga has absorbed _ not only here
but in 12 plunkings this year _ has the club disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is the majors' active career leader, hit 124 times. He
has broken his left wrist, as well as fingers and bones in both
hands, as a result. He freely admits that some of it results
because he leans into the strike zone. But opposing pitchers
apparently are willing to go far beyond the inside corner. A free
trot to first, after all, is better than a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens is when we hit a home run,'' said Galarraga,
who opened this series with a two-homer game Tuesday. ``It never
happens when I strike out two or three times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``We got to get him
some more protection on his hands and arms. You lose him, you're in
deep trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Perez pitch was debatable; Aldred sent a change-up past
Perez's backside to the backstop. But there was little doubt that
Maddux was addressing the abuse the Braves feel that Galarraga
withstood these three games, even if the pitch to Butler slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I hung on to it too long,'' Maddux said. ``If it slips,
you miss the other way. I wanted to bury it in, and a little too
far in.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.

 &HT;    Maddux 'awesome' in 6-0 win
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ To face Greg Maddux during this extraordinary
stretch of his career is like visiting an anesthetist. Two and a
half hours later, you come to, knowing something happened but
you're not exactly sure what.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who for five innings
Thursday afternoon were in twin headlocks with Maddux. Then so
quickly, it was 6-0, it was over and Maddux had not only his major
league-high fourth shutout (his third in six starts) and his sixth
complete game. He became the game's first 12-game winner at 12-2,
took his 10th straight decision and made a lie of the fact that for
much of the afternoon, he and Tampa Bay's Rolando Arrojo were
dueling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped being surprised three years ago,'' said Braves
manager Bobby Cox. ``He's just awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon had its tartness, after Arrojo hit Andres
Galarraga with a pitch in the sixth (the third straight game the
D-Rays plunked the Big Cat). Maddux waited an inning before
drilling Tampa Bay outfielder Rich Butler and Eddie Perez was later
made to dance around Scott Aldred's change-up that flew behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, the Braves had begun to hit home runs regularly _
Keith Lockhart with a solo shot in the sixth, Chipper Jones with a
solo shot in the eighth and then Lockhart again with two on in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won their fifth straight, tying their second-longest
streak of the season. The club returned home to open a weekend
series with the Mets, which concludes the first half of the
schedule, finally getting a glimpse of the team that has tailed
them in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly feel a little bit better about ourselves now,''
said Jones, recalling five deflating losses to Boston and the New
York Yankees last month. ``We've strung a few wins together, we're
swinging the bats pretty well every night with a different guy
coming up with some big hits and some big home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart became the third Brave in three games (with Galarraga
and Jones) to produce a two-homer game, thought the last one, off
Jim Mecir, was a surprise. Particularly after Mecir jumped out to a
0-2 count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to hit a sacrifice fly,'' said Lockhart, who
had one previous two-HR game in his career. ``And then I'm 0-2 and
I'm just trying to make contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Maddux was just trying to make pitches. He allowed
just five hits and struck out eight, all on the same day he was
named the NL pitcher of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cox, ``I betcha he's going to be named something else
too.''

TRIPP RETURNS TO GRAND JURY FOR 7 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp returned to the grand jury room here
Thursday and spent nearly seven hours behind closed doors,
apparently explaining her motives for secretly recording 20 hours
of phone conversations with her ex-friend and former White House
intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's lawyers and supporters presented the public with a
freshly burnished image of Mrs. Tripp as an honest person motivated
only by the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In refuting the suggestion that Mrs. Tripp betrayed the trust of
a vulnerable woman half her age, a person close to Mrs. Tripp's
legal team suggested that Mrs. Tripp had tried several times last
fall to end her friendship with Ms. Lewinsky, who would sometimes
call and e-mail Mrs. Tripp ``20 times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, 48, a Pentagon employee, had grown tired of Ms.
Lewinsky's ``constant talk'' of her alleged relationship with
President Clinton, the person said. ``Please give me a break,''
Mrs. Tripp wrote in an e-mail that she sent to Ms. Lewinsky last
October, according to one person familiar with it. ``I can't take
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait suggests that Mrs. Tripp was a reluctant confidante
who had grown weary of Ms. Lewinsky's attempts to discuss her
relationship with Clinton and the attempts by lawyers for Paula
Jones to quiz both women under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Mrs. Tripp told The Washington Post, ``I did
not cultivate Monica _ she cultivated me. Monica is a very worldly
person. She educated me.'' Two people close to Mrs. Tripp said she
is disgusted by the suggestions in the media that she recorded her
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky to try to write a book.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 9:30 a.m., Mrs. Tripp, who was accompanied by two
lawyers and a family friend, arrived at the federal courthouse
here, saying nothing as she headed to the third floor grand jury
room. Her appearance was met with far less hoopla than her first
day on Tuesday, when she was greeted by 300 reporters and a crowd
of tourists and onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   After the grand jury recessed for the day, one of her lawyers
said that Mrs. Tripp was ``very encouraged by the quality and the
content of the questions presented by the grand jurors and by the
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Joseph Murtha refused to say what questions Mrs.
Tripp had been asked, but said that she would return, at a
still-unscheduled date, to continue testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past several days, many of you have asked the
question, how is Linda doing?'' Murtha told reporters on the steps
of the federal courthouse. ``Well, if there is any truth in the
adage that an honest person's pillow is her peace of mind, I can
assure you that Linda Tripp will sleep very well tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is seen as one of the most important witnesses to
appear before the grand jury in the five-month-old inquiry led by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Mrs. Tripp brought the 20 hours
of tape recordings to Starr's prosecutors on Jan. 12, and told them
that Ms. Lewinsky had encouraged her to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators have said that her appearance is intended to send a
message to Ms. Lewinsky that time is running out for her to strike
an immunity deal and cooperate with Starr's inquiry. If she does
not, they say, she almost certainly will be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, who has very low approval ratings in public opinion
polls, is seeking support on her own web site. ``The Official Linda
Tripp Web Site'' (http://lindatripp.com) includes an address for
Mrs. Tripp's legal defense fund, reprinted news articles and a
chance to send in for the ``I Believe Linda Tripp'' bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   In a note accompanied by her smiling photograph, Mrs. Tripp
said, ``In the end, this investigation is not about left or right,
it's about right and wrong.'' &QL;

BLAIR DENOUNCES ARSONIST ATTACKS ON 10 CATHOLIC CHURCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to add sentence in 2nd graf about three churches being
destroyed. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Arsonists believed to be members of
a dissident Protestant group set fire to 10 Roman Catholic churches
in Northern Ireland late Wednesday and early Thursday, causing
fears that wider sectarian violence could return to the British
province.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the fires were probably the work of the Loyalist
Volunteer Force, a Protestant group opposed to the peace effort,
which has produced cooperation between Protestants and Catholics in
a new provincial assembly. Three churches were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move for a British prime minister, Tony
Blair flew here Thursday to try to dispel rising tension in the
mostly Protestant province. Prime ministers normally avoid the
province at such times, leaving the problems to government
officials and the 30,000-member security force.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, standing Thursday in front of a charred and gutted church
north of Belfast, said, ``I think the act of destruction that we
see behind me here _ that is the past of Northern Ireland, and we
are trying to give people a future that leaves acts of barbarism
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   After consoling parishioners of the church, St. James, in the
hamlet of Aldergrove, Blair spent the day with Protestant and
Catholic leaders of the Northern Ireland Assembly to work out a
compromise in a dispute that seemed to provoke the burnings.
</P>
<P>
   The arsonists were apparently retaliating against Catholics for
a British government decision on Monday forbidding Protestant
marchers next Sunday to pass through a Catholic area. The dispute
threatens more violence, possibly retaliation by Catholics against
Protestant churches and against meeting halls of the Orange Order,
which runs some 3,000 parades in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, both Catholic and Protestnt, fear that Sunday's
parade in the Drumcree area of Portadown, west of Belfast, could
cause violence across the province, as it has for the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are trying to arrange a compromise that would
provide for a quiet, token march by the Orangemen through the
Catholic enclave, without the traditional martial airs, loud drums,
bugles and fifes. That way, the government ban could be rescinded
and both Orange and Catholic militants could save face.
</P>
<P>
   If the Protestant marchers insist on sticking to their
traditional route, they risk clashes with police and with angry
Catholics. The Protestants say their marches are a matter of
freedom of assembly, a basic democratic right. Many Catholics
resent the marches: they celebrate the decisive victory of William
of Orange over his father-in-law, King James II, in 1690.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
tells people that the Orange marches through Catholic sections are
equivalent to permitting the Ku Klux Klan to march through Harlem.
The leader of the Catholic protest in Portadown, Brendan McKenna,
is a former IRA operative who served time in a British prison for
terrorist offenses involving explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Blair met at Castle Buildings in the Stormont area of Belfast
with David Trimble, the Protestant leader and first minister of the
new assembly, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, a Catholic leader of
the Social Democratic Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Blair congratulated them on the start of the new assembly, which
held its first session on Wednesday. He campaigned for the assembly
in May before the referendum that approved the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The arson was widely and vehemently denounced by political and
church leaders, Catholic and Protestant. The Rev. Ian Paisley, the
hard-line leader known for his open anti-Catholicism, denounced the
attacks. Trimble performed his first official task Thursday
morning, visiting St. James, where he said the arson was ``an
appalling, dastardly attack,'' adding, ``Only a handful of people
can take any pleasure in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Protestant clerics, from the Presbyterian Church and the
Church of Ireland, arrived at the church to offer their
condemnation and condolences to the pastor, the Rev. John
O'Sullivan, a soft-spoken man who said, ``It is hard to understand
how this is serving any useful purpose to God or to politics''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Kelly, who runs a pub across the road from the church,
said of the vandals, ``I think they think if there were no
Catholics, there would be no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A very old, feeble man, perhaps in his 80s, dressed in a black
suit and tie, shuffled into the pub for a cup of tea. He grasped a
visitor's arm and whispered: ``Bad show, bad show. We used to have
respect for each other's place of worship.'' &QL;

FORECLOSURE ACTIVITY ON DOWNTURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Surging home sales plus rising prices equals a
continuing drop in foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
   That equation pushed foreclosure activity, in decline for about
the past 18 months, down 19.5 percent in May from the year-ago
level and 20 percent from April, Acxiom Corp.'s DataQuick Products
Division said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   During May, lenders issued default notices, the first step in
the foreclosure process, on 9,177 residential properties statewide,
DataQuick said. That compares with 11,321 in May 1997 and 11,410 in
April.
</P>
<P>
   May's activity fell below the 10,000 level for the second time
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The peak activity occurred in March 1996 when 15,475 homes went
into foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like an improving real estate market to head
off those foreclosures. Values are going up and sales are
booming,'' said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California
Department of Finance. ``It must be an awful lot easier to avoid
foreclosure today than a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreclosure activity is easing the most in the Bay Area, but
Southern California is also benefiting from the improving real
estate market that has brought a recent upsurge in prices.
</P>
<P>
   During May, lenders issued 2,979 default notices in Los Angeles
County, down 9.4 percent from the year-ago level and 18 percent
from April.
</P>
<P>
   There were 168 notices issued in Ventura County, up 6 percent
from May 1997 and down 4 percent from April.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders on Orange County properties issued 517 default notices
in May, a drop of 33.5 percent on the year and 18 percent from
April.
</P>
<P>
   John Karevoll, a DataQuick analyst, said the current number is
about half way to what would be a normal level. That point should
be reached late this year or early next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as prices are going up the trend will continue and
probably get stronger,'' Karevoll said.

<P>
   TITUSVILLE, Fla. _ Northeast Florida felt like a war zone
Thursday as wildfires consumed brush and buildings with no
hindrance from nature and thousands of residents emptied towns
threatened by the onrushing flames.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 residents Thursday joined the more than 30,000
residents of Volusia and Brevard counties forced out of their homes
Wednesday night after wind-swept embers spread fires that had been
consuming rural areas, state emergency management officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of businesses and homes were destroyed or damaged and the
fires kept a 140-mile stretch of Interstate 95 closed from this
city in Brevard County to Jacksonville near the Georgia border.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi 400 stock car race at the Daytona International
Speedway, scheduled for Saturday, was postponed. An estimated
200,000 spectators were expected to attend the race.
</P>
<P>
   Volusia and Brevard counties were experiencing the worst of
about 1,600 fires of varying sizes and degrees of containment that
raged around the state. With neither rain nor lower temperatures in
sight, state officials said the situation may worsen before it gets
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is war,'' said Bob Blay, director of emergency management
services for Brevard County, where one fire had burned 30,000 acres
and five smaller ones kept firefighters busy. ``We've got fronts on
the north and the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarce rain and record high temperatures this year have caused
the worst drought in 50 years, making Florida vulnerable to fires
started by lightning strikes or arson. On average, such wildfires
burn about 100,000 acres of Florida each year, state officials say.
But since June 1, fires have burned more than 280,000 acres, mostly
in the northern and northeastern areas, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, an estimated total of at least 86 homes and 54 other
structures have been damaged or destroyed since May, although state
officials continue revising the figure upward. The fires have also
destroyed more than $190 million of commercial timber, Florida
Department of Agriculture officials said, and drought conditions
have caused more than $135 million in damage to crops like corn,
cotton and peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the danger, no deaths and only about 50 injuries have
been reported. But after burning mostly brush, forest and
commercial timber tracts since Memorial Day, this week the fires
have spread to people's doorsteps, causing the largest evacuations
so far and tremendous dislocation for both residents and tourists
before the Fourth of July holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Haze and stench from smoke chokes areas miles from the fires.
Dozens of city and state roads have been closed, but even on some
passable highways motorists drove with headlights on through thick
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In Ormond Beach, where officials ordered the mandatory
evacuation of half the city's 35,000 residents and closed access
roads Wednesday night, the fires ate through power lines and left
more than 1,000 people without electricity. Many residents reported
their wells had gone dry or were barely pumping after soaking their
houses for the past two weeks with sprinklers, and firemen pleaded
with them to conserve water to increase the pressure in lines.
</P>
<P>
   Among those evacuated in Ormond Beach was Tracy Marmol, 24, an
exhausted housewife and mother of two children who said she was
going on two hours of sleep. Evacuated residents filled hotels or
stayed with friends or at Red Cross shelters in local schools.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of firefighters were also being pushed to the limit.
`` I haven't been home in two days,'' said Lt. John Pars of the
Ormond Beach Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Across the burning areas, dozens of helicopters buzzed carrying
large buckets of water through the sky. Smoke and ash were heavy in
Daytona Beach in Volusia County, where the fires cast a smelly pall
over the few beachgoers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at attractions like the Kennedy Space Center, which
sits in Brevard County and had a fire in nearby acreage on their
property June 21, say they have experienced a drop in summer
visitors but no evacuations or major air quality problems. The
state's major tourist complex, Walt Disney World in Orlando,
reported no impact from the fires raging some 50 miles away and
said attendance remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   After touring some of the affected areas, Governor Lawton Chiles
told Floridians in a televised message this afternoon that ``we're
experiencing fires like Florida has never seen before.'' He praised
``the spirit'' of the firefighters battling the flames and urged
residents to be ready to quickly evacuate of necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank each of you for your prayers as we ask the
Lord to send us some rain,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A few miles south of Daytona Beach, in Brevard County, the first
sign of trouble came Sunday when one rural acre erupted in flames
after a lightning strike, said Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Money
of Brevard County, who briefed Chiles on Thursday at a fire command
post south of here. Because of the dryness of the undergrowth that
fuel the blazes, that fire grew first to 800 acres, then 1,800 and
finally 30,000 in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Money said more helicopters, water trucks and other resources
would have made a difference, but he said much state equipment was
deployed in neighboring Volusia county because of the threat to
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The toll to Brevard County so far has been 30,000 acres burned,
more than 6,000 residents evacuated and at least 17 buildings
destroyed or severely damaged, including a gas station and a fast
food restaurant. In addition, seven firefighters have been injured,
three for second-degree burns and the others for dehydration or
smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   As about 500 firefighters worked on the fires in the county,
officials expected winds of 10 to 15 mph to keep moving the flames
east toward residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still very, very dangerous,'' Money said. ``This will
probably continue to exist until we get 10 days of rain or a
tropical storm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, meteorologists predicted neither.

DAVIES, WILLIAMS SHARE FIRST ROUND LEAD AT U.S. OPEN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Laura Davies is much better at golf than she is
at making predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Davies was asked about her chances at this
week's U.S. Women's Open. She did not sound optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the year has gone, I'm expecting two rounds and to be
on my way back to London by Saturday morning,'' Davies said. ``I
have got no expectations whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. So imagine her delight after Thursday's opening
round of the Open, when Davies shot a three-under-par 68 to share
the lead with Kim Williams. Pat Hurst, Se Ri Pak and Leslie
Spalding were tied for third place at 69. A record Thursday crowd
for the Women's Open, estimated at more than 21,000 by the United
States Golf Association, caused lengthy early-morning traffic
delays on the roads leading to Blackwolf Run Golf Course, this
year's picturesque and challenging site. And the fans were left
with plenty to talk about, including:
</P>
<P>
   _Nancy Lopez, a sentimental favorite trying to win her first
Open, struggled to a disappointing 77. ``I'm disappointed, but I'm
not discouraged,'' Lopez said. ``I figured out a few things and
tomorrow is going to be a better day.''
</P>
<P>
   _Williams, a 35-year-old tour veteran, was a surprising
co-leader. Williams has never won an LPGA event, and her best
finish this year is a tie for 31st.
</P>
<P>
   _Pak, a 20-year-old rookie from South Korea, showed she is a
threat to win her second consecutive major, after winning the LPGA
McDonald's Championship in May.
</P>
<P>
   _Helen Alfredsson had the shot of the day, a hole-in-one on the
14th hole, using an 8-iron from 152 yards.
</P>
<P>
   _Alison Nicholos, the defending champion, is in danger of
missing the cut after Thursday's 78.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was rock solid in a round that included four birdies and
one bogey, using her power off the tee to avoid some of the danger
that found others. A three-time major winner, including the 1987
U.S. Open, Davies is the longest hitter in women's golf, yet on
shorter courses, her advantage is somewhat negated. However, Davies
was in her comfort zone Thursday at the spacious Blackwolf Run
layout, featuring wide fairways and long par-4 holes that allowed
Davies to swing freely. A 3-iron was Davies' primary weapon of
choice off the tee, and she only used her driver on two holes _ No.
2 and No. 7. When you can hit your 3-iron 260 yards like Davies
can, you do not need a driver that often. And she had no sympathy
for her shorter-hitting competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice where you hear the girls struggling, whining
about hitting woods,'' said Davies, a native of England. ``I am
enjoying some of the top players having to hit some decent long
irons.''
</P>
<P>
   Power is never a problem for Davies, but putting has been,
particularly this year. Davies has won at least once every year on
the LPGA tour since 1993, and she has 35 international victories.
However, her last LPGA victory was in March 1997, and she has
missed the cut in four of her last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   But Davies has changed her putting approach, relying on instinct
and feel, rather than worrying so much about technique. That
approach worked Thursday, as Davies made an 8-footer for birdie on
No. 5, a 10-footer for birdie at No. 6 and a 20-footer for birdie
at No. 10.

PACIFIC BELL WILL REDUCE RATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX AND BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ State regulators have ordered Pacific Bell to
slash its rates for products like toll calls and custom calling
services by $305 million annually, a reduction that could save
customers up to $35 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Residential and business customers of the telecommunications
giant should start seeing the savings in the next several months,
said the California Public Utilities Commission in Thursday's
order.
</P>
<P>
   About $242 million of the reductions will go toward lowering
local residential and business toll services _ calls farther than
12 miles _ and special services like call forwarding.
</P>
<P>
   The balance will lower the rates long-distance companies like
AT&AMP;T and MCI pay Pac Bell for access to their phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The savings will depend on usage.
</P>
<P>
   Residential customers who do not make a lot of toll calls could
save a few cents to a few dollars per month, Pacific Bell said.
Those making a lot of calls could save up to $35 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses will benefit more than larger ones under the
new rate structure, with the savings ranging from $9 to $20 per
month, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lower rates immediately make our prices highly
competitive,'' Jim Callaway, the company's president of public
affairs, said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling is the final element of a plan the CPUC
adopted in October 1996 that deals with the issue of how phone
companies would recover the expense of providing service to
high-cost rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, high-volume urban users _ residential and business
customers _ had subsidized phone service for low-volume rural
users, said Bob Lane, an adviser to PUC Commissioner Jessie Knight
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   So the commission decided that all users of telecommunications
services would pay about 4 percent of their total bill in a
high-cost fund that local phone companies could draw from, but
rates were not changed. Thursday's decision returns extra money to
consumers that went into that fund.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stein, an attorney for the consumer advocacy group Toward
Utility Rate Normalization, said Thursday's decision is good
because it benefits a majority of Pac Bell customers.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of SBC Communications Inc., is the
largest provider of local telephone service in California, with
13.1 million customers.

MORGAN AHEAD BY ONE IN GHO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Pete Morgan lived out the first chapter of his
improbable dream Thursday in the first round of the Greater
Hartford Open, rolling in a 15-foot birdie putt on his final hole
to finish off a 6-under par 64 and seize a one-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   He was a qualifier on Monday, and had he not made it, he'd be
some 50 miles to the southeast of the TPC at River Highlands
Course, playing in a North Atlantic Tour event at Norwich GC.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, a 35-year-old Harwich, Mass., native, is a former
Massachusetts Open winner, and he spends his winter playing on the
mini-tours in Central Florida. This is the fourth time Morgan has
qualified for a PGA Tour event, but he has yet to make a cut.
</P>
<P>
   When Morgan, who started on the back nine, made his final putt
from 15 feet on the ninth green, it gave him a one-shot lead on
Kenny Perry (34-31_65) and Scott Hoch (30-35_65). The group at 66
on a calm, sunny day when 57 players broke par-70 included Kevin
Sutherland, Brad Fabel, Spike McRoy, Harrison Frazar, and former
champion Paul Azinger. The Rhode Island pairing of Brad Faxon and
Billy Andrade was in a large group at 68 that included PGA Tour
money leader David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin, who made his PGA Tour debut after finishing joint
23d in the US Open at The Olympic Club, shot a 71 and may need to
better that to make the cut. He accepted his first sponsor's
exemption to play the GHO, rode in a cart, and has accepted a
second exemption to play Quad Cities next week. Should he make two
sizeable paychecks, he might be on his way to staying on the Tour
and playing Pleasant Valley in two weeks. He's got work to do here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK,'' said Martin. ``I scrambled all day, but it was
the same way at the US Open. I didn't hit it like I know I'm
capable of hitting it. I know I'm capable of playing better. I just
hope it shows up tomorrow. Fortunately I made a lot of big putts
today. It's a tough course. You have to hit it better to have some
birdie chances. The fans were wonderful, but if I'm going to make
it out here, I've got to elevate my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin would be exempt on the PGA Tour for the rest of the year
if he earned the amount Connecticut native Brian Claar earned last
year, when he finished 150th on the PGA Tour list ($121,273). ``I'd
have to do really well,'' said Martin. ``In my mind, I'm just going
to play these two.''
</P>
<P>
   For Morgan, who lives in the Tampa suburb of Valirico, Fla., and
attended Jacksonville University after Harwich High School, the joy
ride began when he hit a 3-iron to inside 2 feet on his first hole
to set up the first of three straight birdies. He chipped in on his
second hole from 30 feet and rolled in a 12-foot putt on his third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually the rest of the front nine was a struggle just to
make pars,'' said Morgan. ``I started the same way on the back
nine.'' Then he birdied his 13th (2 iron, 6 feet), 15th (sand
wedge, 8 feet), and the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm getting more comfortable in the bigger events,''
said Morgan. ``I haven't played a lot of Tour events, and I think
my concentration is just getting better on the golf course, and I
block out things. I used to notice everything that was happening
around me. Now I just try and concentrate on the golf course. I've
done the PGA Tour School eight straight years. I've made it through
the first stage every year. I've only made it through the second
stage once. My wife (Karen) is a big inspiration to me. She keeps
me going. She keeps telling me it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch had two bogeys out of the soft sand. ``The course is in
excellent shape,'' he said. ``I think the only part that's iffy
right now are the bunkers. It's not anybody's fault. You can't do
anything about all the rain. The rain collects in the bunkers.''

COALITION AGAINST SWEATSHOPS AT ODDS ON MONITORING FACTORY CODES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight months past its self-imposed deadline to set up a code of
conduct for apparel factories, a presidential task force remains at
stalemate over a number of pivotal issues, including the frequency
with which those factories ought to be inspected and whether any of
them ought to be in China.
</P>
<P>
   The working group's corporate members, including Liz Claiborne,
Nike and Reebok, are now fighting several proposals recently put
forward by its human rights organizations and labor unions, and the
split is such that several members warn that the whole effort may
soon fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, the White House Apparel Industry Partnership,
has 18 members: clothing manufacturers, labor unions, and consumer
and human rights groups. It is trying to set up a system of
voluntary labor standards, at home and abroad, that will assure
consumers that the clothes and the footwear they buy was not made
in sweatshops. It envisions an arrangement in which manufacturers
that met the standards would be entitled to stitch certifying
labels inside their products.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House ceremony 15 months ago, all sides announced an
agreement setting maximum work hours (60 a week), a minimum working
age (14) and wage guidelines, varying by country, for thousands of
factories used by American apparel companies in the United States
and overseas. But the group's corporate members remain at odds with
the unions and human rights groups on monitoring and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations of the task force are confidential, but a copy of
the proposals recently set forth by the unions and human rights
groups was sent anonymously to The New York Times by a member that,
some on both sides suggested, wanted the debate aired in public as
a way of pressuring the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of those proposals called for more stringent monitoring than
the companies want, demanding that independent inspectors examine
30 percent of a given manufacturer's plants each year, twice the
rate suggested by the corporate members.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal concerned a suggested study of apparel wages
around the world. While the two sides agree that the U.S. Labor
Department should perform such a study, the labor and human rights
groups say it should focus on whether those wages are high enough
to meet workers' basic needs _ that is, what is called a ``living
wage.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry representatives suggest that the proposal for such
a focus is intended to embarrass them, and note that in the earlier
agreement they pledged to pay at least the local minimum wage,
though not necessarily a living wage, in their overseas factories.
The companies also dislike a proposal under which the Fair Labor
Association, the organization that would be created to oversee the
code of conduct, would examine whether the factories were paying a
living wage.
</P>
<P>
   China is also a subject of contention. The nonindustry members
have proposed that in any country that does not allow employees
freedom of association and collective bargaining, employers shall
nonetheless take steps to insure that those rights can be
exercised. This proposal says that if, despite such efforts, no
participating company can demonstrate progress in guaranteeing its
employees those rights, then the Fair Labor Association can
determine that producing garments in that country is inconsistent
with the code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Such a determination might not require companies to leave, but
it would certainly apply pressure on them to do so, since they
could otherwise no longer assure consumers that they were complying
with the code. The nation's largest apparel union, the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, a member of the
task force, has long backed such a proposal, aimed largely at
China, which has large numbers of factories that turn out clothes
for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   In light of disagreements like these, a representative of one
noncorporate member said, ``We're teetering on the edge of
collapse.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights, which is also a member, was less pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still engaged in a process about which there are
significant areas of agreement, and a few key areas where there are
real differences,'' Posner said. ``I remain cautiously optimistic
that we're going to find a path that leads to an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Karp, co-chairwoman of the task force and general
counsel for Liz Claiborne, criticized the disclosure of the recent
proposals and, particularly with regard to the China proposal,
suggested that some members were pushing a protectionist trade
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is regrettable,'' she said, ``that someone chose to try to
leverage through the press a proposal that would impede the mission
of the Apparel Industry Partnership. However, we believe many
groups remain willing to make further progress by focusing on
improving working conditions rather than supporting this proposal,
essentially a trade policy that would force companies to pull out
of countries like China.''
</P>
<P>
   When the task force reaches an impasse, its members often ask
Gene Sperling, economic adviser to President Clinton, to jawbone
the two sides. Asked about the latest stalemate, Sperling said:
``When you're trying to put together a novel and indeed historic
partnership, you have to expect it's going to be a rocky road every
step of the way. But I'm still confident that we'll get there.''

EUROPE BANS LEADED GAS TO CUT SMOG 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ People in Europe's car-filled cities are likely to start
breathing a little easier in the next few years because of tough
new anti-pollution rules announced in Brussels this week by the
15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which ban the use of leaded gasoline, require many
car engines and all fuels to become cleaner by 2000. Even tougher
standards will go into effect in 2005. With the changes,
governments hope to cut as much as 70 percent of the pollutants in
emissions from cars, which regularly foul the air in some of
Europe's most beautiful city centers.
</P>
<P>
   Car owners in Europe have to contend with gasoline that is often
taxed up to 75 percent and is among the most expensive in the
world, yet heavy traffic clogs most cities and often cloaks them in
a ozone haze.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Union has set broad air-quality standards for
the next decade that are among the strictest in the world, and the
new rules are part of the strategy for achieving them.
</P>
<P>
   With these new rules, environmentalists feel somewhat
vindicated: they have long argued that the know-how exists to let
millions of city people breathe cleaner air, but the political will
has been lacking. The cleaner engines and fuel should now
drastically cut back the mix of nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons and soot.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-pollution agreement, which was reached late Monday
night and announced on Tuesday, was the result of long and often
fiery negotiations among representatives of industry, governments
and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Compromises were made on all sides. The parties agreed that all
leaded gasoline will be banned from 2000, with one exception.
Vintage car owners will be allowed to buy small quantities of
leaded fuel, which the older cars need to run. Sulfur content must
be reduced in gasoline and diesel fuel. New cars must be fitted
with a computer that monitors emissions and warns when there is a
failure in the catalytic converter.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase will apply to passenger cars and small trucks.
Other regulations for large trucks and buses will follow.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are expected to raise the price of cars between $300
and $600 in the next two years. Carmakers will need to invest some
$65 billion to meet the new standards, according to European Union
officials. The oil industry estimates it will cost $35 billion to
put the program into effect, with most of the money being spent in
southern Europe, where many refineries have not kept up with new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the higher costs are expected to be passed on to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall have cleaner air in our cities and fewer and less
severe ozone episodes in the summer,'' said Ritt Bjerregaard,
Europe's environment commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   One of the toughest fights, but one that brought
environmentalists and carmakers together for once, was over the
permissible levels of sulfur, a pollutant that contributes to heat
haze and breathing problems. Carmakers argued that improved engines
and converters would not cut pollution from exhausts unless the
sulfur level of diesel fuel and gasoline was set at a maximum of 30
parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from the south, including France, Greece, Portugal
and Spain, fought against lowering the sulfur content quickly,
saying the cost to refineries would be too much too soon. They won
with a rule that allows 50 parts per million of sulfur until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   This move angered the more environmentally committed North
Europeans, who said the southern officials were protecting and
rewarding their often antiquated oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a breakthrough,'' said Frazer Goodwin of the
European Federation for Transport and Environment. ``But we could
have done much better. If you want to tackle air quality quickly
you improve the fuel, but some governments are unwilling to push
their refinery industry.'' &QL;

RED SOX PLUS 17 AT MIDWAY POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Halfway home.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday it was 81 down and 81 to go, and anyone who says he
or she foresaw the Red Sox finishing the first half at plus 17
might be worth following around at a Las Vegas sports book or two.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly didn't see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see Bret Saberhagen winning 10 by the All-Star break. I
didn't see Mike Benjamin making like a latter-day Gil McDougald. I
didn't see Tom Gordon as Mr. Automatic in the ninth inning. I
didn't see a lot of things, including something I should have seen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed, it is time for an apology. The following is
directed at the Red Sox outfield: I'm sorry. I was wrong. What a
stupid I was.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of spring training, I was all hung up on power. I was
thinking like, well, someone who is in his fourth decade of
watching Red Sox baseball. I've been conditioned to think that it
doesn't matter all that much what an outfielder does as long as he
hits 25 home runs and drives in at least 90. I had accustomed
myself to shoddy outfield play to the point where I no longer had
any defensive standards.
</P>
<P>
   I took a look at the outfield quintet of Troy O'Leary, Darren
Lewis, Darren Bragg, Damon Buford and Midre Cummings and I foresaw
disaster. I decided that they'd be lucky to hit a collective 30
home runs and I thought that would be translated into losses. I
didn't see how it would be possible to win without more oomph in
the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how. You catch the damn ball; that's how.
</P>
<P>
   Buford and Lewis are tremendous fielders. Bragg's not bad,
either. They catch everything they should, and a lot they
shouldn't. They keep singles singles and doubles doubles, and it
didn't used to be that way around here. They make pitchers
comfortable. More than that, they make pitchers better.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but they've hit 28 home runs already. Sure, half
of them are off the bat of O'Leary, but that was always going to be
the case. O'Leary might hit 30 all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   These guys have been a delight to watch. We know all the things
they aren't, or, at least, all the things they aren't supposed to
be. But they keep playing sound, smart, intelligent, hustling
baseball, and maybe it's time some of the fans and assorted critics
acknowledge that the manager they love to use as a punching bag
because he isn't exactly the second coming of Winston Churchill
when he opens his mouth might be a pretty savvy baseball guy. Joe
Castiglione says that Jim Leyland told him that the biggest
difference in the Braves last year was the absence of Jimy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Now that this bunch has gotten themselves into a post-season
thought process, is there help on the way? They still could use at
least one starting pitcher, and the much-discussed right handed bat
likewise remains on the wish list. Perhaps it's time to ask the
general manager about his priorities. Is he thinking pitching or
hitting?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see who's on the market,'' says Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a given in baseball that teams who have fallen out
of contention seek to peddle high salary players to teams looking
for that little something extra, and Duquette appears to think that
some interesting names will be popping up before too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Mike Piazza is traded in mid-season,'' Duquette says, ``I
don't think you can be surprised at anybody who's on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   One position that has been a continuing positive is second base.
When Jeff Frye was lost for the season in a spring training
base-running drill, thyere was nothing but doom and gloom. Then
came Mark Lemke, but just when he was starting to hit a little he
sustained that freak concussion when Chad Kreuter ran over him on
the baseline. But no one has really noticed his absence because
Benjamin and Lou Merloni have done the job so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have done a nice job,'' maintains The Duke.
``Benjamin has done a great job and Merloni is one of our best
clutch hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be told that the Big Three of Pedro Martinez,
Tim Wakefield and Bret Saberhagen ended the first half at 29-10, or
that Mo Vaughn will knock in at least 100 runs or that Nomar
Garciaparra is already the best all-around shortstop the Red Sox
have had since Joe Cronin was young and frisky. You don't have to
be told that Reggie Jefferson is just a born .300 hitter. You don't
have to be told that it stands to reason that John Valentin will
have a better second half than first (and he did have 24 doubles in
his otherwise disappointing first half).
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't hurt pointing these things out. This, after all,
is Boston, where negativity rules.
</P>
<P>
   They're playing for the wild card, of course, but that doesn't
concern Mr. Duquette, who says he isn't remotely interested in what
the Yankees are doing. ``I don't even think about the Yankees,'' he
insists. ``I don't think about them at all, because the wild card
is going to come from the East.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wild card world now. The idea is to get into the
post-season, and take your chances. It worked for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we can compete with the Yankees in a short
series,'' says Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   He said it. I didn't.

MEDICAID PROGRAMS MUST PAY FOR VIAGRA USE, ADMINISTRATION SAYS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two states, New York and Wisconsin, said on
Thursday that they would defy a new federal policy that requires
state Medicaid programs to pay for medically approved uses of
Viagra, the popular but expensive new impotence pill.
</P>
<P>
   The directive from the Clinton administration prompted an outcry
from governors, who said they had not been consulted even though
states pay more than 40 percent of Medicaid costs. The National
Governors' Association said that Medicaid coverage of Viagra should
be a state option, not a federal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to governors on Thursday, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle,
administrator of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration,
said state Medicaid programs must cover Viagra when it is medically
necessary for treatment of male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hinckley, a spokesman for the New York State Health
Department, said: ``We disagree with what the federal government is
saying. We have a responsibility to protect the health of Medicaid
recipients. The federal government needs to get a better handle on
potential complications that can arise from use of Viagra before it
requires state Medicaid programs to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley said New York officials were concerned about Viagra's
interactions with other drugs and its effects on people with
chronic conditions including heart disease. The label for Viagra
says it should not be used by people taking organic nitrates like
nitroglycerin, which is often used to treat angina, or chest pain,
caused by clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Gov. George Pataki of New York
said on Thursday night, ``The federal government should not be
requiring New York or any other state to pay for Viagra until there
is a better understanding of the impact this drug has on
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, James Malone, a spokesman for the state's
Department of Health and Family Services, said: ``We are not
covering Viagra right now, and we don't intend to. We will resist
being forced to cover it. We don't believe that Viagra is medically
necessary. This federal directive is ill advised and ill
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how the disagreements will be resolved. They
could end up in court if poor people press claims for the drug.
Alternatively, the Clinton administration could try to withhold
Medicaid money from states that refuse to comply with the federal
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said last month that they would
probably require coverage of Viagra. On Thursday they issued a
formal directive requiring such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle said states could ``prevent abuse and misuse of
Viagra'' by requiring prior approval for prescriptions or by
limiting the number of refills or the number of pills in a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would monitor use of Viagra and
could halt coverage of the drug if evidence showed that it was
being misused or abused. Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services, ``is greatly concerned about the potential for
clinical or financial abuse of Viagra,'' Ms. DeParle said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association estimated that Thursday's
directive would cost federal and state agencies more than $100
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Baxendell, a health policy analyst at the association,
said there had been ``virtually no consultation with states'' to
assess the costs or implications of a nationwide mandate for
Medicaid coverage of Viagra. States pay 43 percent of Medicaid
costs, or roughly $73 billion of $170 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverage of Viagra should be a state option, not a mandate,''
the governors' association said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc., the maker of Viagra, says more than two million men
have taken the pill since it was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration on March 27. It is one of the most popular new
prescription products in history.
</P>
<P>
   Mariann Caprino, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said the company had
requested Medicaid coverage in all states. As of early June, she
said, 26 states covered Viagra, often with some restrictions. The
other states did not cover it or were considering whether to do so,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale price of Viagra is $7 a pill, Ms. Caprino said,
while the retail price at pharmacies ranges from $8 to $10 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caprino praised the Clinton administration's decision. Male
impotence ``is a bona fide medical condition that has a tremendous
impact on patients and their partners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But disability rights advocates expressed outrage that the
government was requiring coverage of Viagra while allowing states
to deny or cut back coverage of medical equipment needed by people
with severe disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Toubman, a lawyer at the New Haven Legal Assistance
Association, in New Haven, Conn., said, ``It's very disturbing that
the White House would instruct states that they must cover this sex
pill while allowing states to ration care for quadriplegics and
people with cerebral palsy or Lou Gehrig's disease who need special
medical equipment to keep them alive and to stay out of nursing
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle predicted that a relatively small number of Medicaid
recipients would qualify for Viagra. Women and children account for
90 percent of the 40 million Medicaid beneficiaries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years, the federal government has required states to cover
``family-planning services and supplies,'' widely understood to
include birth control pills and other contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Geralyn Lasher, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of
Community Health, said: ``We are very disappointed with today's
announcement from Washington. We are still looking at our options,
to see if we have to cover Viagra. We estimate that it would cost
us $14 million a year _ $14 million that we could spend on maternal
and infant services or people with HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, Michael Deily, the state Medicaid director, said
Thursday's announcement was ``not a surprise but certainly a
disappointment.'' He said that Utah initially allowed 10 Viagra
pills a month for Medicaid recipients, then reduced the allowance
to five pills and was now considering ``more stringent criteria''
for evaluating a patient's medical need for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, states do not have to cover prescription drugs
under Medicaid, but all states do so. Federal officials said that
if a state included prescription drugs in its Medicaid program,
then it must cover all medically accepted uses of FDA-approved
drugs manufactured by companies that agree to give discounts, or
rebates, to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Medicaid law says states may deny payment for a few
drugs, including those used for cosmetic purposes and those used to
promote fertility, to treat anorexia or to achieve weight loss.
But, Ms. DeParle said, Viagra does not meet the criteria for any of
these exceptions.

GART BIDS $445 MILLION FOR KEY STAKE IN SPORTS AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intensifying the battle to consolidate the troubled sporting
goods industry, Gart Sports Co. has offered $20 a share, or a total
of $445.2 million, in cash for 70 percent of Sports Authority Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by the scrappy but growing company controlled by
the investor Leonard Green comes several weeks after Venator Group
Inc., formerly the Woolworth Corporation, offered a stock swap
worth about $513.6 million based on Thursday's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the synergies here are great,'' said John Douglas
Morton, the chief executive of Gart. ``These are two companies with
consistent formats. The are both full-line sporting goods stores,''
he said, as opposed to Venator, which also runs several specialty
stores. ``There would be significant advertising savings,'' Morton
added. ``Sports Authority has very little product overlap with Foot
Locker. But our vendor structure is almost identical. There would
be real big wins in this transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which was made in a letter to Sports Authority
chairman and chief executive Jack Smith by the management of Gart
called for the remaining 30 percent of Sports Authority's
outstanding shares to be publicly traded. These shares would
represent 51 percent ownership interest in the common stock of the
combined companies.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Venator's stock swap offer values the deal at about
$16.15 a share. Venator operates Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker,
Kids Footlocker and Champs athletic stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority, with annual revenue of about $1.47 billion,
has 205 superstores. Gart had sales of $700 million last year from
its 122 stores, which are based primarily in the West. Gart
recently purchased Sportmart Inc., another competitor with 59
stores. Under the proposed merger, Gart stores could assume the
Sports Authority name.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman from Venator declined to comment Thursday, saying
that the company's lawyers and investment bankers were consulting
on their next move.
</P>
<P>
   The company was attracted to Sports Authority's larger stores
outside of the malls, where most Foot Locker stores are situated,
as well as access to new suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Sports Authority said in a telephone interview that he
was surprised and a bit flummoxed over the Gart overture. ``I am in
a state of amazement,'' Smith said. ``I found out about it 8:30
this morning. Well, OK, 11:30 last night. We were gearing ourselves
toward Venator, and this is a little disruptive.'' When asked if it
was fun to be the center of a potential bidding war, he said:
``It's not that fun. I mean, it's not like they're offering $50 a
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's opinion was loud and clear. Shares of Gart rose
$2.75, to $14.75, and shares of Sports Authority jumped $1.375, to
$16.50. At the same time, Venator shares also increased, closing at
$20.875, up 68.75 cents, a sign that investors, who sent Venator
stock down 12 percent after it announced its potential deal with
Sports Authority in May, were glad to hear of its possible demise.
</P>

   The sporting goods industry is ripe for consolidation. The
segment, which is spread out among many small regional players and
a few big national chains, had grown quickly in recent years,
making it difficult for any single retailer to reap high profit
margins. Many of the companies are run by ex-coaches or athletes
whose product knowledge is not matched with business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, companies like Nike have found shoppers' interest
waning recently, causing the entire sneaker segment to plummet.
Retailers like Sports Authority, with their large stores, have had
a hard time getting decent returns on equity.
</P>
<P>
   Like many segments of retail that have consolidated in recent
years, it is likely that sporting goods will, in a few years, be
represented by just a few large chains, with almost all but the
most regional of players folding into the larger companies or
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who owns 61 percent of Gart's shares, has often bought
troubled companies. He purchased Payless Drug Stores from Kmart
Corp. in 1994, merged it with Thrifty Corp. and sold to Rite Aid
Corp. last year for $2.4 billion. He also acquired Hechinger Co.
and Kmart's Builders Square unit, which he merged to create a
home-improvement chain.

TOP 100 FILMS: FOREIGN FLAVOR TASTES BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: UPDATED VERSION OF FOREIGN. with LIST100) I used to
tell people my top-10 list had 40 movies on it. It's a common
problem. We all like to make lists, but there's never enough room.
</P>
<P>
   So when the American Film Institute recently decided to list the
hundred greatest films, they restricted it to American films _ or
at least they say they did. Somehow, a few English films made the
list. But no foreign language films did.
</P>
<P>
   And that leaves us a whole universe of movies not eligible,
including some of the best ever made.
</P>
<P>
   So, this week, in response, we are providing the list of 100
best foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these films are established classics, and if you worry
that the list has too many of the ``usual suspects,'' I hope I have
included enough eccentric personal choices to give everyone
something to talk about. That, after all, is the purpose of such a
list.
</P>
<P>
   The movies on this list were chosen for several reasons. Some
are among the greatest artistic creations of our civilization.
Others are on the list because of their enormous influence on other
filmmakers. Still others are just such fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me, if you think all foreign films are dreary and
boring, you haven't been watching the right ones. Admittedly,
French or German films are more likely to investigate the outer
reaches of alienation and philosophy than Hollywood films, but you
will never find better battle scenes than in Akira Kurosawa's
``Ran.'' You will be hard pressed to find more suspense than in the
last half-hour of Georges-Henri Clouzot's ``Diabolique.'' And if
it's blowing things up you are after, check out Clouzot's ``Wages
of Fear,'' in which Yves Montand and a bunch of toughs drive a
truck full of nitroglycerine 300 miles over unpaved South American
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I don't want to gloss over the difference between American
and foreign films.
</P>
<P>
   I have always made the distinction between what I call
``Hollywood films'' and ``real movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The real movie is about being human, about relationships,
character, moral issues, and historical and philosophical meaning.
Hollywood movies are about blowing things up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are foreign-made Hollywood movies by my definition,
and Hollywood-made real movies: One thinks of spaghetti Westerns on
one hand, and of Francis Ford Coppola's ``The Conversation'' or
John Ford's ``The Searchers'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   At least one film manages to play both sides of the field: AFI's
No. 1 film, ``Citizen Kane'' manages like nothing else I know, to
join seamlessly the slick Hollywood side with the depth and
character development of a ``real movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As critic Pauline Kael has said, it is one of the few great
movies that is also great fun.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, foreign filmmakers play out their creativity
in a larger world, with more possibilities and fewer hidebound
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Hollywood ``earned'' its reputation as the
manufacturer of the shallow happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   My list of the 100-best foreign films is a very personal list,
drawn from a lifetime of watching movies. I expect you have your
own films to nominate. But these are the ones I came up with.
</P>
<P>
   First on my list is ``Children of Paradise,'' which is more like
a full-length novel than any other film I know. It has a rich cast
of characters and follows them over many years. And as in
``Brothers Karamazov,'' each character also embodies a different
philosophy. It is a very full movie.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the Paris of the 1840s, it tells the tale of Baptiste
Debureau and the theatrical world in which he lived. It is also
about love, art and social class.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Kane'' manages to mix high and low successfully, so does
``Children of'' ``Paradise,'' in its own way. It has something of
the sweep of ``Gone With the Wind,'' the passion of ``From Here to
Eternity'' and the wit of ``Ninotchka''.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a film you can grow with rather than out of. When I
was fresh out of college, I identified with the idealistic
Baptiste; after a few marriages, I took the practical Frederick
Lemaitre's attitude toward relationships; nowadays, I uncomfortably
find myself more in the cynical Pierre-Francois Lacenaire.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Renoir's ``Rules of the Game'' might just as well claim the
top spot. No other film is as deft at showing the disjunction
between what our impulses are and what society demands of us.
</P>
<P>
   Cocteau's ``Orphee'' is also a great deal of fun, playing with
all the tricks of cinema to create visual magic. What you see is
likely to remain in your memory forever.
</P>
<P>
   Fellini's ``8{'' begins with the same kind of magic, a dream
sequence that you can't get out of your mind, but it continues on
to be about a film director that doesn't know what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Samurai'' is a pure action film, the model for the
Western, ``The'' ``Magnificent Seven,'' but much, much better. You
actually care about these characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potemkin'' is one of those seminal films that invent the
language of cinema. What is all the more astonishing is that this
Soviet propaganda film actually plays down the more sensational
aspects of the affair. If it had been truer to history, it would
have felt more simply propagandistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Passion of Joan of Arc'' is not the most consistently good
film. It has stretches of languors, but when the camera is on the
face of Maria Falconetti, in the only film she ever made, the
intensity is literally unbearable. It is the face of human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's ``Ran'' is a Japanese retelling of Shakespeare's
``King Lear,'' and shows the director at the absolute peak of his
powers, with the best battle sequences ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Dietrich sings ``Falling in Love Again'' in ``The Blue
Angel,'' which makes ``Cabaret'' look like ``Gidget Goes to the
Weimar Republic.'' Steamy, smoky, atmospheric, its director, Josef
von Sternberg _ an American _ never did anything so good again.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a serious commitment of time and attention to sit
through Andre Tarkovsky's ``Andrei Rublev,'' but you will know you
have experienced something worth your effort, as the director takes
us through a brutal vision of life and the place in it for both art
and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, almost any of the next 25 or 30 could legitimately
make it to the top 10, but I'll stand with the ones I have chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like ``Jules and Jim'' or ``Amarcord'' are pure pleasure
to watch. Others, such as ``Rashomon'' or ``Wild Strawberries''
have at their core a moral vision. And still others, such as ``The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' and ``Metropolis'' are simply visionary.
</P>
<P>
   You will find intensity, passion, intellect, visuals, acting and
directing the equal or better of anything from Hollywood. What you
will not find are giant lizards and serial car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   A few, such as ``Henry V'' and ``The Mahabharata'' are
unabashedly theatrical, using their staginess as a style.
</P>
<P>
   There are few British films on my list: AFI threw me a curve and
included several on its list. So, ``Third Man, Dr. Strangelove''
and ``Lawrence of Arabia'' are not here, although they would have
been.
</P>
<P>
   You will discover that a handful of directors made the majority
of these films. I cannot apologize for that. I made the list
without considering authorship. As it turns out, Ingmar Bergman
shows up a dozen times; Kurosawa, 10. Francois Truffaut and
Federico Fellini follow up with seven and five films.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean Bergman is the greatest director? No. He has made
many great films, but he is more prone to self-parody than any
other important director and when he is bad _ as in the miserable
Elliot Gould film, ``The Touch,'' he comes close to rivaling Ed
Wood.
</P>
<P>
   In art, there is no best. There is only overwhelming. &QL;

GROSSES FOR `ARMAGEDDON' BELOW EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The future of ``Armageddon'' dimmed significantly
as its first day took in a somewhat disappointing $9.7 million at
3,090 theaters nationwide, analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Armageddon'' had the third-largest Wednesday opening
ever, its receipts were far short of the $17.4 million Wednesday by
``Independence Day'' at the start of the Fourth of July holiday
period in 1996. ``Armageddon'' also finished well under the $14
million first day for ``Men in Black'' a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a horrible opening but everyone was expecting more,
particularly since `Armageddon' opened without any new
competition,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
tracking service. He lowered his forecast for the five-day
Wednesday-Sunday total from $75 million to the $68 million-$72
million range, well under the $85 million record ``Independence
Day'' set for the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney release, which cost $140 million to make and an
additional $60 million to market, stars Bruce Willis as the leader
of an oil-drilling team assigned to blow up a Texas-size asteroid
before it destroys the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-the-world theme and impressive special effects should
draw the core young moviegoers. But appeal to other demographics
might be hampered by mixed reviews and the better-than-expected
performance of ``Deep Impact,'' the comet-vs.-Earth movie that has
grossed $136 million domestically in less than two months for
Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Armageddon'' needs to pull in massive grosses
in its first weekend because it will face serious competition
starting July 10 from Warner Bros.' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and
DreamWorks' ``Small Soliders.''

WIMBLEDON, England _ For Martina Hingis, the lessons in humility in
this season of comeuppances continue.
</P>
<P>
   For Jana Novotna, a chance for redemption and closure beckons in
a single swoop.
</P>
<P>
   For Nathalie Tauziat _ wow, dare she dream?
</P>
<P>
   A chilly, dreary Wimbledon fortnight concludes for the women
Saturday _ as always, weather permitting _ with as unglamorous a
final as the world's most famous tennis tournament has played host
to in ages. But for Novotna and Tauziat, each desperately seeking
her first Grand Slam title as they near the end of unexceptional
careers, it's a match made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy,'' said Tauziat, the 16th seed who has been
coming here since 1984 but never had reached a semifinal before
ousting unseeded Natasha Zvereva 1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 on Thursday.
``I'm not on the moon already, but almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, twice a runner-up with only bad memories to show for
her many efforts, remains tightly tethered to the earth despite
having upset her doubles partner, the No. 1-ranked and top-seeded
Martina Hingis, 6-4, 6-4. The victory became a payback for Hingis'
win in last summer's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for me, the job is not done yet,'' said the third-seeded
Novotna. ``I still have quite a lot of work to do. Let's hope what
the Duchess of Kent told me last year is right. She said,
`Third-time lucky,' and so here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   With the teeny-boppers storming the Women's Tennis Association
Tour, neither Novotna nor Tauziat got much, if any, attention from
the punters when Wimbledon began. The gray ladies presumed to be
primed to reclaim the stage from the Hingis generation were named
Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the last
having launched the retro trend by taking the French Open last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Most eyes focused on Graf, the seven-time champion who has spent
more than a year trying to come back after reconstructive knee
surgery and a succession of minor injuries. But Zvereva, another of
the suddenly emergent unsung elders, swept away Graf and then took
out Seles, only to be decked by Tauziat, the least likely Saturday
star of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired,'' Zvereva, the holder of five Wimbledon doubles
titles, said of the end of her most memorable singles run. ``I need
a mental-institution break. I've never been in this situation
before, and now I realize what I've done. It's really draining and
disappointing to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Nathalie just kept slowly lurking back into the match. At
the end, I felt like she was beating me from the net and from the
baseline as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, the African-born, 30-year-old Frenchwoman, had started
horribly _ ``I was embarrassed,'' she admitted _ but rallied with
much aplomb, turning things her way for good by reeling off seven
consecutive points in the second-set tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell myself, `Nathalie, you have to fight,''' Tauziat said.
``I do not want to miss this chance to be in the final. And I fight
good. It's going to be a nice present to be there on Centre Court
(Saturday). If I play my best, I think I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite hitting only 46 percent of her first serves, Tauziat
makes her debut final appearance after 43 Grand Slam tournaments,
the longest such drought in the history of the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, 29, in turn, has been to Wimbledon 13 times, and in
both of her near misses she failed to hold significant leads.
Against Graf in 1992, she was up 4-1, 30-love in the third set
before suffering a monumental collapse that led to her breaking
down and sobbing on the shoulder of the aforementioned Duchess
after receiving the runner-up's plate.
</P>
<P>
   Against Hingis a year ago in bridesmaid revisited, she won the
first set before folding, although she was plagued by a pulled
abdominal muscle that worsened as the afternoon progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Add to those setbacks a loss in an Australian Open final, and
you have people cruelly snickering about her being a
Choke-oslovakian. Were Novotna now, as the favorite, to lose to
Tauziat, it would cement her reputation forever, overshadowing a
career that has seen her recently surpass $9 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   She would no doubt give a few of those bucks back in exchange
for a guarantee of victory over Tauziat. From the sound of it,
Novotna is stressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great comeback Nathalie made in her match,'' Novotna
said. ``I watched a little of it. She's definitely a very, very
dangerous opponent. It would seem that, yes, I should be favored,
but believe me, it's not going to be easy to beat Nathalie Tauziat
when she's already made it to the final.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be easy if she plays at the same level she exhibited
against the stunned Hingis. The unremarkable score might prevent
the match from being remembered years into the future, but several
of its games were as tense, hard-fought and well-played as any in
Wimbledon's annals.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna survived only by steeling her ever-suspect nerves after
an 0-3, love-40 start and delivering routinely spectacular shots at
crucial junctures the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, her backhand overhead winner off an excellent
Hingis lob to secure the fatal break in the next-to-last game
showed a touch of genius. After hitting that same shot sharply
cross-court repeatedly, Novotna this time knocked it straight down
the line, catching Hingis charging in the wrong direction with no
chance of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I'm playing great,'' Hingis said, ``and I almost
can't lose the (second) set anymore, and all of a sudden it was 6-4
for her and I was saying, `Hey, come on, pick it up again.' She's a
great grass-court player, and she was definitely the better player
out there today.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hingis called her performance in the first set ``terrible''
and owned up to not being in the best of condition, a factor
because of the difficult matches she had endured to get into the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping three of four Grand Slams in 1997, she has been
exposed as vulnerable on a more regular basis this year. She looks
like the teen-ager she is rather than a certain world champion for
years to come. The experience of losing to Sanchez Vicario in the
Roland Garros semifinals and now to Novotna here might be teaching
her a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it seems like the older, the better,'' she said. ``I
hope it's going to be like that with me also: the older, the
smarter, the cleverer and the better.''
</P>
<P>
   A fitting motto also for the current Wimbledon.

GROSSES FOR `ARMAGEDDON' BELOW EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The future of ``Armageddon'' dimmed significantly
as its first day took in a somewhat disappointing $9.7 million at
3,090 theaters nationwide, analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Armageddon'' had the third-largest Wednesday opening
ever, its receipts were far short of the $17.4 million Wednesday by
``Independence Day'' at the start of the Fourth of July holiday
period in 1996. ``Armageddon'' also finished well under the $14
million first day for ``Men in Black'' a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a horrible opening but everyone was expecting more,
particularly since `Armageddon' opened without any new
competition,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
tracking service. He lowered his forecast for the five-day
Wednesday-Sunday total from $75 million to the $68 million-$72
million range, well under the $85 million record ``Independence
Day'' set for the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney release, which cost $140 million to make and an
additional $60 million to market, stars Bruce Willis as the leader
of an oil-drilling team assigned to blow up a Texas-size asteroid
before it destroys the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-the-world theme and impressive special effects should
draw the core young moviegoers. But appeal to other demographics
might be hampered by mixed reviews and the better-than-expected
performance of ``Deep Impact,'' the comet-vs.-Earth movie that has
grossed $136 million domestically in less than two months for
Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Armageddon'' needs to pull in massive grosses
in its first weekend because it will face serious competition
starting July 10 from Warner Bros.' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and
DreamWorks' ``Small Soliders.''

BANKBOSTON DISCIPLINES WORKERS IN LOAN SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ BankBoston Corp. chairman Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford
said Thursday that about 20 employees have been disciplined for
varying degrees of negligence in a recent $73 million loan scandal
that he said has left him angry and embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gifford said the punishments ranged from a
small number of outright dismissals to reprimands. He declined to
discuss specific employees, but bank sources said among those fired
was Mark E. Linehan, the immediate supervisor of fugitive banker
Ricardo S. Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Linehan continued to work for BankBoston,
spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman declined comment. Linehan had been
temporarily reassigned from his position as director of the tainted
international private banking unit pending the results of an
internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasco, general manager of the institution's international
private bank in New York, allegedly made the fraudulent loans to a
controversial Argentine businessman and his companies over a
three-year period, then disappeared in February when the bank
sought to question him. He remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said the recently completed internal investigation
determined that no BankBoston employee besides Carrasco
participated in the fraud. However, he said the scheme pointed up
flaws in the international private bank's lending practices and
revealed several instances in which employees failed to heed signs
that Carrasco was making millions of dollars in loans to a
businessman with a long record of criminal and financial misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we feel that people should have known &UR;  &LR; because facts were
in front of them, then we think we have to take action,'' said
Gifford. ``People are accountable when they have
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gifford's comments were part of an effort by BankBoston to put
the worst fraud in its 214-year history behind it. In a memo sent
to 23,000 employees Thursday, Gifford and president Henrique C.
Meirelles announced: ``We are now ready to put closure to the
embarrassing and painful episode that began in March with our
discovery of fraudulent activities by the head of our International
Private Banking office in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said the bank has taken specific actions to prevent a
recurrence of the scandal, including relocating management of its
international private banking operations from the United States to
South America, where most of its wealthy clients reside. ``The
responsibility for (international private banking) should be with
the people in Brazil and Argentina that know the markets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said he accepted part of the blame for the scandal.
``When something happens which bruises (our) reputation, I'm
angry,'' he said. ``In this case we had one individual who
defrauded our system, with a significant financial loss. It's a
source of embarrassment, and I'd be less than honest if I didn't
say that I'm not proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The effort to bury the scandal comes as Oldemar C. Barreiro
Laborda, the Argentine businessman who received the loans from
Carrasco, has charged through his lawyer that he met with other
BankBoston officials who were aware of his financial arrangment
with Carrasco. The bank is suing Barreiro in state court in New
York in an attempt to recover the loans.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents filed this week, Barreiro also charged that
the bank had fraudulently induced him into acknowledging that he is
responsible for repaying the bulk of loans. In response, the bank
ridiculed Barreiro's claim and said it was filing a formal
opposition ``at the risk of affording this argument a level of
dignity it clearly does not deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank has said its Argentina employees were aware of
Barreiro's past but were kept in the dark about the loans by
Carrasco. But Edward Griffith, Barreiro's lawyer in New York, said
Thursday that his client claims to have attended meetings in 1996
in Buenos Aires with other senior bank officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of Barreiro's business relationship with Bank Boston
International in New York was common knowledge and discussed'' at
the meetings, Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the Barreiro-controlled companies that
received loans from Carrasco, LoJack Argentina, maintained a
separate checking account at the BankBoston branch in Buenos Aires.
Gifford said Thursday he was unaware of that account. But the bank
later confirmed the LoJack account was opened in 1996 and was
closed as the result of court action in April.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said he believed that BankBoston employees in Argentina
had ``certain tangential contact relationships'' with Barreiro. But
he added: ``To the best of our knowledge, Carrasco kept our people
in Argentina as far away from this as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Carrasco, Gifford said the bank was victimized by an
employee who escaped suspicion largely because ``this was a guy
that seemed to personify what we think this company is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year bank veteran who was trusted throughout the company,
Carrasco was able to continue making the fraudulent loans for
several reasons, Gifford said, but the most important was the
confidence that he enjoyed from his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasco had authority to both write the loans and verify
collateral that supposedly backed them, he said. The bank has since
separated these ``operating'' and ``line'' responsibilities
throughout the bank, Gifford said. Many of the loans, he said, fell
below Carrasco's signature authority of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, since the loans supposedly were secured by cash,
they were not scrutinized as closely, Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to look at your associates and say, `You might
be the next Carrasco,' because an atmosphere of paranoia could
develop from something like that,'' Gifford said. ``But, having
said that, we must reenforce that policies and procedures cannot
just be overridden by individuals.''

MILLEN WANTS 10
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is the second-oldest motor-racing event in the
United States. And if Rod Millen has anything to say about it,
Saturday's 76th running of the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb
in Colorado will be historic.
</P>
<P>
   Millen hopes to be the first to ever to cover the 12.42 miles of
constantly curving dirt road in less than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the goal,'' said the 47-year-old Newport Beach driver.
``I'm just hoping the weather will cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen, a three-time Pike's Peak overall champion, has been
close to breaking 10 minutes three times before.
</P>
<P>
   He turned in the fastest run ever in 1994, reaching the top of
the 14,110-foot mountain in 10 minutes, 4.06 seconds. He did a
10:04.54 in taking the overall title last year and had a 10:13.64
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 20 years of rally, road and off-road racing
behind him, Millen keeps his engagement list short these days. At
its top is the Pikes Peak race, where he has come to be called the
King of the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a favorite of mine,'' Millen said. ``It's one of
the unique classic motor-sports events in the world. How many other
places can you race to 14,100 feet at the top of a beautiful
mountain with no guard rail?''
</P>
<P>
   Millen has a new vehicle to chase the 10-minute mark this year.
After years of outfitting him in a custom Celica, Toyota this year
has provided a Tacoma pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I convinced them we could build a truck that would be faster
than the Celica,'' Millen said.``So far, the truck is working
really good. We're really happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He should be. Much of the design and production work on the
racer was done by Millen's people at Rod Millen Motorsport in
Huntington Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The project was a labor of love, Millen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many elements to consider when designing a
vehicle to race up Pikes Peak,'' he said. ``Slippery dirt corners,
extreme altitude changes and lightning-fast down- and up-shifting.
I love the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon back in front: Jeff Gordon is back on top in the Winston
Cup season points race following his win last weekend at Sears
Point in the Save Mart-Kragen 350K. The victory was Gordon's fourth
of the season and came off his fifth pole start.
</P>
<P>
   Of those disappointed about the cancellation of the Pepsi 400,
Gordon might be the most disappointed. He won the Pepsi 400 in 1995
and the 1997 Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   IRL disappointment: Don't look for the Indy Racing League
schedule to include a stop in New Hampshire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20,000 showed up for last week's New England 200 resulting
in a reported $700,000 loss and the loss of Pennzoil as race
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Slow down: High speeds at last year's CART Marlboro 500 at
California Speedway, where Mauricio Gugelmin laid waste to the
tour's fastest lap record (previously 234.665) with a 240.942
circuit, made everybody on the tour nervous.
</P>
<P>
   And the concern gave impetus to an effort to find a way to slow
the cars on the tour's speedways.
</P>
<P>
   Engineer Mark Handford of Swift Engineering in San Clemente _
builders of race cars _ seems to have come up with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers have recently tested a new device called the Handford
wing, that adds drag and reduces downforce on the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia product Bryan Herta, currently sixth in season points
standings, said the device is doing the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the speeds were too high at Fontana last
year,'' Herta said. ``I think the new wing was the quickest and
cheapest way to reduce the speeds. I think the racing will be close
and very exciting for the fans. We'll probably be about 15 miles
per hour slower.''

EDITORIAL: STARR SHOULD NOT TARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr has every right to appeal the dismissal this week
of the tax evasion charges he brought against former Associate
Attorney General Webster Hubbell. The decision by U.S. District
Court Judge James Robertson seems questionable in several respects.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr should heed the larger message of this and other
adverse rulings of recent weeks. That message is that the
investigations of President Clinton must soon be brought to a
conclusion. Although we are sympathetic to Starr's complaint that
the White House has tried to impede his investigation, the time has
come to lay out his evidence and conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's central findings that Starr exceeded his authority
under the independent counsel statute and reneged on his immunity
deal with Hubbell are closer questions legally than his harshly
worded opinion might suggest. Starr's use of financial documents
obtained from Hubbell under a limited grant of immunity to build
the tax case against him is troubling. But whether higher courts
will agree that it was a violation of Hubbell's Fifth Amendment
rights is uncertain. Supreme Court decisions on the rule against
self-incrimination have limited its reach.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson mistakenly suggests that the prosecution of Hubbell
strays too far from Starr's legal mandate to investigate the
Whitewater affair. Since Hubbell, a former law partner of Hillary
Rodham Clinton, knows a great deal about the Whitewater matter, it
does not seem unreasonable for Starr to pursue the suspicion that
he received hush money from Clinton friends.
</P>
<P>
   But in seeking further judicial review of these issues, Starr
ought not to lose sight of the broader picture. The various legal
matters involving Clinton need to be resolved. The impatience of
various federal courts with Starr's tactics has added to national
unease about the open-ended nature of his inquiry. The office of
independent counsel was established not only to assure the
unfettered investigation of charges against the highest government
officials. It was also created to insure that a prosecutorial
judgment be rendered in a timely manner. In the case of Clinton and
Starr, that time is rapidly approaching.

DESPITE POSITIVE SIGNS, THORNY PROBLEMS REMAIN IN WAKE OF CHINA
TRIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, July 5)

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ No matter how successful President Clinton believes
his China trip was, the U.S. administration concedes it is not at
all certain about its effect on the future of the world's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's colorful nine-day trek through the most important
developing country, with 1.2 billion people and economic potential
that defies measurement, was marked by some positive signs.
</P>
<P>
   But thorny problems remain in Sino-American relations as well as
in the establishment of any firmly democratic institutions in China
itself. Even senior Clinton administration China-watchers refused
to interpret the president's trip as a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to what happens next, we don't know,'' said Susan Shirk,
deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
affairs. ``I don't think it would be wise to say this opens up a
whole new era in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has had a tremendous transformation in its economic
life, in its social and cultural life,'' Shirk said. ``And I think
that this is certainly stimulating a certain amount of political
debate. Where it ends up, we really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something of a paradox in the president's journey.
Although Clinton urged China to move forward on the democratic
front as strongly as it has in economics, there is no certainty
that the current Communist regime has the will to make such
historic shifts or the capacity to support the weight of such
changes even if they occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make careful measurements about how much load the political
structure can bear,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
``And considerable thought has gone into measuring the expectations
of all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those administration analyses is that Chinese
President Jiang Zemin has consolidated his position enough within
the government, military and _ most importantly _ the hierarchy of
the Communist Party to make him worth dealing with in such a
high-profile manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some reasonable analysis that says Jiang Zemin ... is
in a position to make some moves and to do some things that might
have been impossible to do a year or two ago,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The easy, but not necessarily appropriate, comparison is the
Soviet Union in the last half of the 1980s as authoritarian control
was released, sparking the unraveling of the other Communist giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to do a Gorbachev,'' said Richard Haass of
the Brookings Institution, a National Security Council staff member
during the Bush administration, referring to the Soviet leader who
first allowed the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The administration agrees. Shirk, a former political science
professor at the University of California at San Diego, said, ``I
think it would be a real mistake to look at the trajectory of the
Soviet Union and Russia and say the exact same thing is going to
happen in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rodman of the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom, an NSC
official in the Reagan administration, sees ``some interesting
political ferment'' in China but believes there are definite
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that this regime will make concessions but on the
margins. They will never make a concession on human rights that
will endanger the nature of the regime,'' Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things get out of hand,'' he added, more conservative
forces in the ruling Communist Party elite ``will point to the
Gorbachev model and say this is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts contend that the atmospherics of Clinton's
trip, including the Chinese leadership's decision to broadcast live
the Clinton-Jiang news conference, should not be confused with
advances on the substantive agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political theater has been first class,'' James Lilley,
U.S. ambassador to China in the Bush administration, told Fox News.
``Now we get down to the hard business of making these deals
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials took the developments as more
meaningful and encouraging than some of the analysts, especially
the decision to broadcast the Clinton-Jiang news conference in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 70-minute back-and-forth, the two leaders discoursed at
length on some of the touchiest subjects for the Chinese hierarchy,
including the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square, in which hundreds of protesters were killed by
army troops, and the troublesome province of Tibet, where Buddhists
face persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taboo subjects,'' said the State Department's Shirk, ``that
had not been discussed previously. It's not going to be possible to
bury those subjects again.''
</P>
<P>
   The freewheeling news conference and its emphasis on human
rights issues, however, belied the White House's contention that
the Sino-American relationship had many more components than
personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   That was true in part because of the unyielding pressure of
American opponents of Clinton's China policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics ended up setting more of the public agenda (of the
summit) than the president,'' Brookings' Haass said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the administration conceded that all the atmospherics were
not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bader, director of Asian affairs at the National Security
Council, said that although the Clinton-Jiang news conference was
broadcast live, the coverage by Xinhua, the Chinese government news
agency, ``was not complete. They left out significant portions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials suggested that any loosening of
restrictions at the top has not filtered down, or was not intended
to filter down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a system which still, obviously, is far from a free
system and which is selective and restrictive in the way it
covered'' the summit, Bader said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Chinese government leadership, administration
officials noted what Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of State for
East Asian and Pacific affairs, called ``real evidence of the
growing nationalism of the current generation in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth cited questions to Clinton from students at Peking
University critical of U.S. support for Taiwan and of the protests
against Jiang when he visited the United States last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that reflects a genuine trend that is out there,''
Roth said. ``And that's something we have to deal with in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics back home contended Clinton was attempting to move
Sino-American relations to a ``post-Tiananmen'' phase before that
was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   When Roth was challenged on the point, he proposed an artful
formula that sought to have it both ways and sum up the
administration view of the post-summit relations with China:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mean does Tiananmen cease to be an issue, the answer
is: of course not. If you mean are we working to improve the
relationship to increase our strategic dialogue ... overall: of
course.''

GOOOAAALLL!!!!!!!!!!!!! UNIVISION'S AUDIENCE SOARS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Cisneros looks at the number of Hispanic television
households tuned to Univision's World Cup broadcasts and is bowled
over: 1.5 million for Germany-Mexico, 1.4 million for
Belgium-Mexico, 1.3 million for South Korea-Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only Mexican games, although Mexican viewers in the
United States comprise the network's largest demographic group.
Argentina-England drew 1.1 million, France-Paraguay engaged 1.0
million and Nigeria-Denmark drew 979,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to get good ratings and beat ESPN,'' said
Cisneros, the president of Univision and former secretary of
housing and urban development. ``But we're in mourning. If Mexico
had held its one-goal lead on Monday, it would be playing Brazil on
the Fourth of July. Imagine the ratings for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 47 games Univision has carried against ESPN or ESPN2,
Univision has outscored them in TV households 40 times. ESPN won
seven times. ESPN2 never won. But each of ABC's nine broadcasts
outdrew Univision's.
</P>
<P>
   Univision's overall World Cup rating is down from an 11.3 in
1994 to a 10.0 this year, but in the four years since, the
network's household reach has grown from 6.5 million to 7.7
million. So despite a lower rating, the average number of
households watching each games has risen 5 percent to 776,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ABC's rating is down from a 5.3 to a 2.3; ESPN's has
fallen from a 1.7 to an 0.8, and ESPN2's has slipped from an 0.8 to
an 0.5.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 had the advantage _ and
excitement _ of a World Cup played domestically and at better
times. That edge may be gone for the three Disney-owned networks
(and the U.S. team faded quickly).
</P>
<P>
   But Univision has the advantage of showing games played by five
Spanish-speaking teams, plus Brazil, the defending champion, and
perennial South American powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Los Angeles on the two Saturdays that Mexico played
in the early morning at 8 o'clock, and it was like L.A. shut
down,'' said Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic fans have had a second World Cup outlet: Radio Unica, a
six-month-old network of 60 stations. On World Cup days, it beams
17 hours of games, analysis and talk shows. Ratings are
unavailable, but thousands of e-mail messages and phone calls
indicate a passionate response, said Nickie Jurado, a spokeswoman.
``We did a poll to see if Mexico would go to the second round and
got 7,000 calls in two days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Univision and Radio Unica are the beneficiaries of a huge event
that is a great lure to major advertisers like AT&AMP;T, Budweiser and
Honda that want to reach the Hispanic market, which has proven to
be intensely brand loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to reach the Hispanic marketplace in a showcase
medium, this is it,'' said Michael Gutkin, managing partner of Fova
Inc., a Spanish-language advertising agency owned by Grey
Advertising. ``Nothing comes remotely close.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros added: ``The World Cup gives them new levels of
identification with the Hispanic audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Unica's games through Tuesday were done by its announcers
watching on a monitor in a Miami studio. But starting Friday, they
will be live in France.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer fans _ Latino and others _ who have experienced games on
Univision and Radio Unica get a tantalizing choice: the fevered
play-by-play emotion of Univision's Andres Cantor or the
incredible, impassioned fervor of Jorge Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   It's like choosing between Pagliacci and Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor is renowned for his ``Goooaaaaallll'' call, which he
admits he did not invent. The exclamation is traditional among
Latin soccer announcers. Ramos' call of Mexico's first goal Monday
against Germany consisted of three separate ``Goooaaalllls''
totaling 30 seconds, and well, some homer-like comments. (It was
accompanied by Mexican music; each goal is accompanied by music
appropriate to the scoring country, said Jurado.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We get even more excited than Univision,'' said Ramos, who is
45 years old. ``Three times more, maybe four times. I call every
touch, like Andres, but much faster.'' Ramos's rapid calls make
Cantor sound as if he is speaking at 33 1/3 rpm. Ramos has been
gargling with salt water to preserve his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In South America, radio is very important,'' he said. ``People
turn the volume down on TV and listen to the radio.'' Hmmm. I wait
for something exciting to happen on ABC, ESPN or ESPN, then flip to
Cantor.)
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm getting letters and e-mail from Argentina and
Mexico telling me that I`m making them cry, I get them so
excited.'' Not surprisingly, he does so by saying, after a Mexican
goal: ``The Mexican team has the power and morale of the Mexican
people _ they are very hard workers like the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros listened to Ramos call Paraguay's match against France.
``The Paraguayan goalkeeper stopped a few French assaults and Ramos
was shouting, `We're with you! We love you! You're a patriot!' ''
said Cisneros, who describes his man, Cantor, as an artist. ``He
was un-be-lievable!''

CIA CLEARED OF WRONGDOING IN POLITICAL-INFLUENCE INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A yearlong internal investigation by the CIA of
unauthorized contacts between a Democratic Party leader eager to
help a wealthy party donor and the CIA has found that no laws were
broken by officials at the spy agency, government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are included in a report by the CIA inspector
general that also recommends that the agency devise new rules to
insure that employees know to inform senior managers immediately of
any future contacts from political figures.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes CIA supervisors for being inattentive to
warnings from lower-level employees that Donald Fowler, the
Democratic Party's national chairman in the last election, was
trying to enlist the agency's help to open White House doors for
the Democratic donor, Roger Tamraz.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has not been publicly released, cites a
supervising attorney in the CIA's general counsel's office with
failing to notify senior agency officials about the political
contacts, which occurred in late 1995. Investigators were not able
to explain the disappearance of internal memorandums sent to top
CIA officials notifying them of Fowler's efforts to get the CIA to
help Tamraz meet with President Clinton, despite objections from
the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Tamraz's lobbying efforts became public last March in the
congressional investigation into campaign finance abuses. In late
1995, Tamraz, an American financier, was barred by council staff
members from attending White House events for major Democratic
donors because of questions about his background.
</P>
<P>
   But Tamraz had a longstanding relationship with the CIA. He
suggested to the Democratic National Committee that the agency
might help overcome the Council's opposition. Fowler, eager to
please a man who was giving $300,000 to the Democratic Party,
telephoned Tamraz's contact in the CIA directorate of operations,
the agency's clandestine espionage arm, to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   That contact was identified only as `Bob,' and his actions later
became the subject of a congressional investigation into the
campaign finance scandal. The report cleared `Bob' of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general found that `Bob' had been troubled by
Fowler's call and he immediately asked an attorney in the
Directorate of Operations for advice. The attorney told `Bob' to
keep a written record of what happened. Within days of Fowler's
call, the attorney told his supervisor in the general counsel's
office. But the supervising attorney failed to pass word of
Fowler's contacts to John Deutch, the director of Central
Intelligence at the time, or other senior officials, the report
determined.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, `Bob' wrote a lengthy memoranum that also
disappeared. Deutch and other senior CIA officials were not aware
of Fowler's efforts to use the agency for political purposes until
just before it became public in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking official to receive `Bob's' memo was William
Lofgren, chief of the division in which `Bob' worked. He told
investigators that he had placed it in his outbox for delivery to
senior officials. Investigators say it disappeared, however, and
senior CIA officials never received it.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector general's report found no evidence of
wrongdoing by Lofgren, who later retired and worked briefly as a
business consultant for Tamraz.

EDITORIAL: SAVING JAPAN'S BANKING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   At long last, Japan has put together a credible bank rescue
package that contemplates closing banks that are hopelessly
insolvent while taking bad loans off the books of banks that can
make it. If executed well, the plan should help pull Japan out of
recession and ease Asia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has gone from denial to dithering in dealing with the
crisis in its banking system that stems from loans made in the
1980s when the country's bubble economy was inflating property
values. Japanese leaders hoped the problem would go away, but
instead it festered until a financial crisis hit Asia's developing
economies, leaving Japanese banks with more bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan fails to act effectively, the yen is likely to continue
falling along with the country's economy. That would add to
pressures on other Asian countries, notably China, to devalue their
currencies and would deprive these countries of a strong Japanese
market they desperately need.
</P>
<P>
   The plan announced Thursday calls for bad loans to be sold for
what they can fetch. Doing that will establish market values, which
have been unclear because few such assets have been sold, and may
bring in both Japanese and foreign bargain hunters. Banks that are
able to survive are to get capital infusions, while other banks
will close.
</P>
<P>
   Creating stronger banks, with the capital to lend, is an
essential step toward easing the credit crunch that is hurting the
Japanese economy. Unfortunately, it appears that Japanese
authorities have a lot of work to do in figuring out just how bad
off their banks are, a fact that will delay action.
</P>
<P>
   The first test of the plan will come in the handling of the
proposed merger of the very weak Long-Term Credit Bank with the
stronger Sumitomo Trust. If stockholders in the weak bank are
virtually wiped out, with its managers dismissed, and if Sumitomo
has enough of its own bad loans taken off its books that it emerges
as a stronger bank, that will send the right signals.
</P>
<P>
   Japan remains a rich, productive country. Unlike its Asian
neighbors, it has the wealth needed to solve its financial crisis
and move on. Given the history of Japanese inaction, it is
understandable that the financial markets reacted skeptically to
Japan's plan, with the yen losing ground against the dollar. But
there are reasons to hope the currency markets will soon reverse
course as Japan proves that, finally, it is taking the needed
steps.

ANNAN SAYS NIGERIA WILL FREE POLITICAL PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to add new 8th, 9th grafs expanding on Annan's meetings
with Abubakar and tribal leaders. No pickup.)  (ps) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday
that Nigeria's new military government pledged to release all
remaining political prisoners, among them Moshood K.O. Abiola, who
was jailed after apparently winning the presidential election in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Annan made the announcement at a news conference in Abuja, the
Nigerian capital, after meeting with the country's president, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving Nigeria with the stage set for the release of all
political detainees,'' Annan said. ``The government will make an
announcement at the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   No official government announcement followed Annan's remarks
Thursday. But in London, Wura Abiola, one of Abiola's daughters,
said that she believed his release was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola agreed to drop his claim to the presidency based on the
1993 vote, which the government annulled, Annan said Thursday
before leaving Abuja for Ghana. Abiola apparently has made no
promises about future elections, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him more realistic than some of us outside,'' said
Annan, who met Abiola on Tuesday. ``Chief Abiola realizes that a
lot has changed.'' Annan said that Nigerians appeared to want new,
democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   A vote had been scheduled for Aug. 1, but only one name was on
the ballot, Gen. Sani Abacha, the former military ruler, who died
suddenly on June 8. Abubakar has said that he would turn over power
to an elected civilian government by Oct. 1, in keeping with the
timetable set by Abacha. The government has not announced whether
the August election date is firm and whether it would allow genuine
opposition candidates to run.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials came away from the four-day visit to Nigeria with
the sense that Abubakar is trying to defuse the volatile political
situation he inherited, but that he has to work very carefully
because hard-liners from the Abacha years are still in positions of
power. U.N. officials said the new Nigerian president seemed to be
seeking advice from many quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general also met with Nigeria's eight paramount
chiefs and a range of nongovernmental agencies involved in human
rights and politics. Their consensus was that Abiola should be
freed without conditions. They also sought a reasonable but not too
extended timetable for elections, perhaps at the end of the year.
Elections should be announced as soon as possible, they said, so
that Nigerians can start putting their energies into constructive
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Ms. Abiola, a management consultant, said that her
father would need time to get back in touch with his family and
with politics, and take time to reflect on his future political
career. Abiola had been denied reading material in prison and was
kept as isolated as possible from even his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola had four wives and four sets of children. All have united
in campaigning for his release. One of his wives, Kudirat Abiola,
was gunned down execution-style while working to have her husband
released.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abiola said that family members have taken note of reports
that Abiola has renounced his presidential claim, but want to hear
the decision from him, and they want him to be given some breathing
space to decide what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very happy to see my father and start to
rebuild on a personal level all those dimensions in my father's
life and our lives,'' she said. ``We have to see that we get more
than a promise, that we actually get him home and can see him and
talk to him. Nothing will substitute for hearing his words and
understanding where he is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to get in touch with all the relevant Nigerian
parties,'' she said. ``Only after that can he make a decision. The
Nigerian people will start to express what they desire out of my
father in the month after his release. It's only after he weighs
the different demands, after he understands the different
implications, that he can then re-evaluate his position. Hopefully
the people will give him time to take stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, a wealthy businessman from southern Nigeria who is a
Yoruba and a Muslim, could still face difficulties if he decided to
run in a new election because the all-powerful military is
dominated by northerners.
</P>
<P>
   But some moderates in the military establishment have apparently
come to realize that Abiola cannot be sidelined indefinitely and
will have to be brought into the political process at some point if
Nigeria is to move toward a more democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Nigerians have borne much of the military government's
repression. In 1995, a group of nine southern environmental
activists, including the playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa, were executed
for opposing development of their region. Nigeria, Africa's richest
and potentially most powerful country, already under some
international sanctions for annulling the 1993 vote, was suspended
from the Commonwealth because of the executions.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Emeka Anyaoku, a
Nigerian based in London, said Thursday that he expected Abubakar
to outline a democratic program for Nigeria that will allow the
country to be readmitted.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin welcomed
the news about prisoner releases and said that a high-level
American delegation would be going to Nigeria this weekend for
meetings with Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, Nigerians have suspected that talks may
have been going on with Abiola. Annan's visit may have provided the
opportunity to make a public breakthrough in his case, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Abubakar has already freed 26 other political
prisoners, including Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military
ruler who turned over government to civilians in the 1970s. In
1995, he was imprisoned by Abacha for campaigning again for
civilian government. Human rights groups estimate that Nigeria is
still holding between 150 and 250 political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Some Nigerians have suggested that Abiola may be encouraged by
followers to reinstate his claim to the presidency after being
freed. &QL;

A HERO'S WIDOW IS NAMED FIRST WOMAN ALL-STAR CAPTAIN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAIRE SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Major League Baseball announced last year it would retire
No. 42 to honor Jackie Robinson, there was universal applause for a
sport rarely credited with hitting the right note.
</P>
<P>
   Let the applause begin again. For baseball will establish
another heartfelt first on Tuesday night when a major league
All-Star team will have a woman as a captain for the first time.
Vera Clemente, the widow of Roberto Clemente, will fill that role
for the National League when the All-Star Game is played at Coors
Field in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Her selection by the National League president, Leonard Coleman,
not only acknowledges the work performed on behalf of humanity by
Clemente, who perished on Dec. 31, 1972, while on a flight of
relief supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. It also also
acknowledges the strong bonds of marriage that has resulted in
strong partnerships within the game.
</P>
<P>
   Such partnerships have resulted in worthy contributions, such as
the women's scholarship fund set up by Dana and Jeff Kent this year
and the children in crises fund-raisers run by wives of major
league ballplayers, a program inspired by Susan Johnson, the wife
of the former All-Star second baseman and manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Clemente's contributions span generations. Though widowed
with three sons aged 2, 5 and 6, Vera Clemente never lost sight of
her husband's mission of making a difference on behalf of humanity
through sports. Nor did she forget his commitment to being a good
parent.
</P>
<P>
   She raised to manhood the boys: Roberto Jr., the oldest, a color
commentator on Spanish-language broadcasts of Yankee games, and
Luis Roberto and Roberto Enrique. Vera Clemente also fulfilled
Clemente's dream of building a sports complex to benefit all the
youth of his island commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   The Roberto Clemente Sports City, which started on its way to
being a reality when the government of Puerto Rico granted it land
in Catalina in 1974, is a sprawling complex offering sports
instruction, organized team and league play and educational
assistance. About 30 graduates a year go on to earn scholarships in
colleges in the States. All because Vera Clemente never let her
partnership or Roberto's dream die in that fiery crash that killed
the Pittsburgh Pirates' star more than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Roberto were a team and clearly she represents and is
a major part of the Clemente legacy,'' said Coleman, who was also
the inspiration behind the ultimate retiring of Robinson's number
in every major league franchise. ``So I cannot think of a more
inspirational and appropriate captain than Vera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and at the same time I felt very honored,''
Vera Clemente said Thursday by telephone from the Roberto Clemente
Sports City, where her two younger sons work as administrators. ``I
lived the last eight years in baseball with Roberto before he died.
I felt very close to the game. And since he died we've continued to
try to develop youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera Clemente says she especially appreciates the honor of being
an All-Star captain because she, like her husband, almost met a
tragic end, coincidentally close to the anniversary of his death.
For Vera Clemente fell and broke a leg in January. The cast on her
leg caused blood clots that slowly made their way to her lungs,
resulting in embolisms that nearly cost her her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three days I couldn't breathe well,'' she said. ``Finally
I called an ambulance. I almost died. I said goodbye to everyone
but I prayed to God for more time because there is still so much to
do. I think that faith, God listened. God gave me another
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera Clemente, more than a grandmother of 10 and mother of 3,
but matron of her island's baseball community, remained in
intensive care for nine days. Only last month was she deemed well
enough to return to her beloved sports city. ``I still am under
care but I am saving my strength to make this trip because it is
such a great honor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrives at Coors Field, the Clemente legacy, begun by
Roberto, nurtured by Vera, will be on stage once again in the major
leagues. Not that it ever truly disappeared. For the legion of
players from Puerto Rico who were inspired by Clemente has never
been more impressive, as proved in last year's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Eight players born or raised in the Commonwealth dotted the
All-Star rosters, including Roberto Alomar, Juan Gonzalez and Ivan
Rodriguez , all of whom will start for the 1998 American League
team.
</P>
<P>
   Five players from Puerto Rico figured prominently in last year's
American League victory. The Indians' Sandy Alomar Jr. was named
most valuable player after hitting a game-winning homer. His hit
made a winner of the Royals' pitcher, Jose Rosado. Javier Lopez of
the Braves and Edgar Martinez of the Mariners also homered. Bernie
Williams of the Yankees scored the winning run when Alomar homered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we honored Roberto in January, we also honored all of
those players,'' Vera Clemente said proudly, referring to a
ceremony at the sports complex in conjunction with the 25th
anniversary of the plane crash. ``And when they spoke they all
mentioned Roberto and how they try to follow him. I know that he is
a symbol for him.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is Vera Clemente, not only for her fellow Puerto Ricans
but also for all the players, coaches and fans of the game who
understand that contributions to humanity, whether by man or woman,
benefit not only a sport but us all.

NYC TRANSIT SYSTEM TO BEGIN SALE OF UNLIMITED-USE FARE CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new era for the New York City's mass transit riders
begins at midnight Friday night, when the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority's unlimited-ride Metrocard passes go on
sale, offering what transit officials hope will be a huge new
incentive to use subways and buses.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $17 for a 7-day pass and $63 for a 30-day pass, the
new cards could yield significant savings for regular users of the
city's mass transit network.
</P>
<P>
   But more fundamentally, officials and advocates for riders are
hoping that the passes will transform the way New Yorkers use and
think about mass transit and create a much more mobile city, where
people hop on and off buses and subways with abandon because they
no longer have to worry about the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for riders have questioned whether the system is
prepared to absorb the 100 million new rides a year the passes are
expected to attract, an increase of 6 percent over today's levels.
They contend that the authority has not added enough service to
keep pace with an 18 percent increase in weekday ridership over the
last two years. But the authority maintains that it will be able to
add enough buses and subways should they be needed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The passes, which were announced by Gov. George Pataki in
December, nearly complete a series of fare breaks that the
transportation authority began last year with free bus-to-subway
transfers in July and continued with an
11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 bulk discount in January.
</P>
<P>
   Those discounts, along with the city's booming economy, have
fueled a 9 percent increase in bus and subway ridership since last
year, to 5.5 million rides a day. A one-day unlimited pass, priced
at $4, is scheduled to be offered in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The passes are also expected to benefit Pataki, who is running
for re-election and whose best-known piece of transit policy until
a year ago was to reduce state aid to the system in 1995, forcing
cuts in service and an increase in the fare, to $1.50 per token
from $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Thursday that he expected the benefits of the
discounts to be felt beyond the confines of the buses and subways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's going to be good for the economy, we know it's
great for the fare payer and we know it's going to be outstanding
for the environment,'' he said. ``Everyone's been talking about how
congested the city is with too many cars, and by offering these
options we will continue to get people out of their cars and onto
mass transit.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with riders this week found them generally welcoming
the new cards, with some planning to buy one pass as a trial to see
whether they get their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it would stop me from taking so many cabs,'' said a
46-year-old advertising buyer on the D train platform at 42d Street
who gave her name only as Valerie. ``It has to do with commitment.
Once I've made that $17 investment up front, I see it as a free
situation, rather than a $5 cab ride minus the dollar-and-a-half
public transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Johnson, who lives in Harlem and works in a print shop
in Greenwich Village and who also takes the subway frequently to go
shopping or to the movies, was certain the pass was for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll use it enough,'' said Ms. Johnson, who got off the
A train at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on her way to celebrate
her birthday in Atlantic City. ``I usually buy my $15 Metrocard
every Friday for the week,'' she said, ``but a lot of the time I
have to get a new one sooner so I can get around.''
</P>
<P>
   The new passes look identical to the pay-per-ride version of the
Metrocard, the now-familiar gold card with a magnetic strip that
allows fares to be deducted electronically at the turnstile or the
fare box and is now used to pay for more than 70 percent of all
rides.
</P>
<P>
   They new cards will be sold at all 468 subway stations and at
more than 3,200 newsstands, delis and other stores outside the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Passes bought at token booths must be purchased with cash, but
the authority expects that in the fall, it will begin to introduce
vending machines that take credit or automated teller cards.
</P>
<P>
   The pass is good from the moment it is first used until midnight
7 or 30 days later, depending on the kind of pass. A 30-day pass
does not expire automatically at the end of a calendar month.
</P>
<P>
   The only restriction on the passes is that they cannot be used
more than once within 18 minutes, except for transfers between
buses and subways. This is to prevent people from passing the card
to friends and swiping several riders through the turnstiles at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of monthly passes on the MTA's railroads _ Metro-North
and the Long Island Rail Road _ will be able to buy a new version
of the pass with an unlimited bus and subway pass on the back of
the card.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the pass is a worthwhile investment will depend on how
often it is used. A rider who takes only 5 round trips a week, or
10 rides, would be better off with an 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10
Metrocard, which effectively reduces the fare to $1.36. At 10 rides
a week, a 7-day pass holder would pay about $1.70 a ride and a
30-day pass holder about $1.54 a ride.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who typically takes even a couple of extra trips a
week would save money. Someone who takes seven round trips a week
on a 7-day pass would pay $1.21 per ride, while a 30-day pass
holder taking seven round trips a week would effectively pay $1.09
a ride.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been some concern that lower-income people would
avoid the Metrocard because of the up-front cost, officials in
other cities have found that such passes are used just as widely by
people at all economic levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower-income people realize that it's the cheapest way to do
it,'' said Daniel Fleishman, a senior consultant at Multisystems
Inc., a transit consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., ``and those
are the people who use transit most because they use it not just
for work but for all trips.''

WILLIAMS, DAVIES LEAD PACK BY ONE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ There was a telling moment in Thursday's opening
round of the US Women's Open at Blackwolf Run, one of those
sequences that helps describe the mysteries of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Having split the fairway of the difficult 421-yard finishing
hole with a driver, Annika Sorenstam was some 190 yards from the
pin. Lofting a 7-wood approach high into the bright blue Wisconsin
sky, Sorenstam elicited thunderous applause from the large gallery
with a shot that came to rest 18 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Standing over her tee ball, a 3-iron that was 10 yards inside of
Sorenstam's, Laura Davies ripped into a 6-iron that never lost
track of the pin. It bounced just short of the green, hopped a few
times, and nearly rolled in. ``I don't know how it didn't really go
in,'' said Davies. ``It stopped an inch right in the jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies tapped in to complete a 3-under par 68, which stood as
the lead until Kim Williams, a 10-year Tour veteran who has never
won, put together the afternoon's only sub-par round to tie her.
Davies and Williams lead a group of three _ Se Ri Pak, Pat Hurst,
Leslie Spalding _ by one shot, while five players, including former
champion Liselotte Neumann and LPGA Tour money leader Donna
Andrews, posted 70s on a day when only 10 players in the field of
150 broke par.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam had promised herself not to give up as she stalks her
third Open title in four years and following Davies's dramatics at
18, she had a test. The Swede coolly drained her birdie putt for a
71, but her finesse took a back seat to Davies's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very impressive,'' said Sorenstam. ``Laura is a strong
player. She is longer with a 3-iron than my driver. To me, she
doesn't hold back anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Davies may possess the purest power game of anyone,
John Daly and Tiger Woods included. Thursday she used her driver
just twice, on this the second-longest (6,412 yards) course in
tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to hit 3-iron, 3-iron on a par-4,'' said Davies,
``I'd rather do that than try and hit my driver and hit a 7-iron or
8-iron in. This is a long course, and I am long enough with that
3-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   That she is, but Davies would have to string together dozens of
those gigantic 3-irons to accurately measure the length of Nancy
Lopez's afternoon. This is a tournament that has eluded her grasp
21 times and last year's heartbreaking loss to Alison Nicholas left
her with an even greater thirst for it. Lopez will have to wait
another year to possibly quench that desire, for she put up one of
her worst US Open efforts in front of thousands of admirers,
getting her only birdie of the afternoon on the 18th to shoot 77.
More and more it appears that she will join Sam Snead and Kathy
Whitworth as legends who could never win the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Davies isn't legendary, but her power is. The
34-year-old Davies plays a game with which no other woman is
familiar. When it is on, as it was in 1987 when she won the US
Open, it can leave the opposition in her divots. When it isn't (and
she's missed the cut five times on Tour this year), she is left
hopelessly unsure of herself. Despite breaking 70 for just the
sixth time in 45 rounds in the Open, that feeling still grips
Davies, who is as refreshingly honest as she is powerful. ``I am so
low on confidence, that is the trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, her pursuers had better hope Davies's troubles
are over.
</P>
<P>
   The trio who shot 69 went out in the morning when the winds, and
greens, were softest. Pak took immediate advantage with birdies at
two of the first three holes, but the LPGA Championship winner
nonchalantly parred the backside, though she broke 70 for the third
time in her five US Open rounds. Hurst won the Nabisco Dinah Shore
in the spring and has played well this year, but Spalding has never
finished better than a tie for 21st in her brief pro career.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Mucha, Jackie Gallagher-Smith, and amateur Brenda Corrie
Kuehn are also at 70, but it is the player lurking in a crowd of
seven at 71 _ Sorenstam _ who commands attention.
</P>
<P>
   For as effectively as Davies can overpower a course, Sorenstam
can manage it to near perfection. She made a triple-bogey at the
par-4 fifth and ``for a few seconds'' she thought of last year at
Pumpkin Ridge in Portland, Ore. Sorenstam was trying for an
unprecedented third straight Open triumph, but the dream died early
when she triple-bogeyed the ninth hole. She never recovered, shot
77, and missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she held her composure. ``I told myself it is only
Thursday, let's try and get this behind you and go from here.''
Which she did. No one made more than her five birdies _ three on
the back nine _ and when she answered the Davies fireworks at No.
18 with her usual precision, Sorenstam had put herself in great
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised myself I won't give up and I won't,'' said
Sorenstam. ``I am going to keep grinding and griding.''
</P>
<P>
   And Davies, for sure, will keep ripping and ripping. Fifty-four
more holes will prove if her power can beat finesse.

 &HT;    Trying to get through fire to Grandma's House
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Getting to grandma's house has never
been such an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   With traveling on I-95 out of the question, the only way to
drive to a holiday weekend with my wife's family in Fernandina
Beach is to take a meandering drive through the rolling midsection
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   And so here we are, two adults, two kids and a puppy who's not
yet toilet-trained, hurtling through one-stoplight towns and
feeling like the crew from Lost in Space.
</P>
<P>
   We've been at it for the past six hours, and best as I can tell,
we're somewhere near Starke. Or Waldo.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Waldo? Don't ask me.
</P>
<P>
   After waking up Thursday morning with the news that 125 miles of
Interstate 95 was closed, we wondered if that meant our planned
weekend in the coastal town north of Jacksonville was out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   We'd made the trip many times between Palm Beach County and the
Florida-Georgia border. Always on I-95. It's an incredibly boring,
yet reliable, way to travel the 350 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, getting to the northeast corner of the state
without using either I-95 or U.S. 1 was a question too unthinkable
to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   I called the Florida Highway Patrol office in Lantana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is I-95 still closed from Titusville to Jacksonville?'' I
asked the trooper who answered the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then how do I get to Jacksonville?''
</P>
<P>
   She told me to take Florida's Turnpike to I-75, and then east on
I-10 to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be a better way than that,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking I-75 to I-10 is a great way to get to Tallahassee, not
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   She gave me a couple of other numbers to call. The next person I
spoke to was a highway patrol trooper from Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Highway 301,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turnpike, to Highway 301, then to I-10, which hooks up with
I-295, the Jacksonville bypass, which then runs into I-95 north of
Jacksonville _ a short 20 minutes from Fernandina Beach.
</P>
<P>
   I drove to Kmart and bought a road map, then loaded up the crew
in the mini-van for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   This drive was bound to put the ``long'' in long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That was six hours ago. The dog has yet to have an accident in
the car, although she has managed to swallow some unidentified
object on the floor. The kids have had several territorial
skirmishes in the back seat, and my daughter gave her first, ``Are
we there yet?'' sometime before we reached Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   But all in all, the trip's been a success. Unlike the typical
boredom of I-95, we're slicing through the heart of Florida,
rolling through little towns such as Citra, Hawthorne and Sparr.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen strange roadside motels, old women sitting in the
shade in front of piles of watermelons, and pastures filled with
grazing horses. It's a landscape dotted by fast food restaurants,
multiple chances for salvation and miles and miles of sidewalk junk
that my wife insists on calling ``antiques.''
</P>
<P>
   And we're not alone. The road is filled with other travelers
with their pop-up campers and bicycle carriers. And at stoplights,
we take the measure of the amazing number of trucks _ big 18-wheel
rigs _ that were forced to leave the interstate highway to make it
to Georgia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   My wife just announced we've passed Waldo. Word has it we'll be
on I-10 within the hour, and then, according to my road atlas,
we'll be in the outskirts of Jacksonville in another 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the puppy doesn't puke.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, lots of Palm Beach County residents will
remember this Fourth of July weekend because it was the year they
couldn't buy fireworks. But for us, it will be the year the fires
forced us to see a little more of Florida than we usually do.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kuralt, the traveling journalist, once said that the
interstate highway system was so good it was possible to go
anywhere without actually seeing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, look at that,'' my wife, who's driving now, says to the
kids. ``Linda's yard arts!''
</P>
<P>
   I glance up and see a shrine of tacky lawn ornaments. With any
luck, we'll get to Fernandina Beach by 9 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   That's eight-and-half hours _ a good two-to-three hours longer
than it usually takes us. But we're not complaining. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come home,'' my daughter asks, ``will we have to take
this way back again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I say. ``I'm sure they'll have the highway open by
then.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope so. I've had enough Kuralt for one weekend.

HENMAN VS. SAMPRAS: CAUSE MEETS SPECIAL EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The prayer rugs come with explicit
instructions and have already been mass-produced. Pray for Henman,
command the tacky paper mats, which helpfully provide a pair of
racquets marking the spot for each knee of obedient kneelers.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of them: England, still smarting over the
second-round World Cup loss of its revered soccer team, has turned
its sporting attention and affection toward Tim Henman, the first
British man to reach Wimbledon's semifinals in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   All Henman has to do to become the first British finalist since
Bunny Austin tried and failed to take the title in 1938 is beat the
incumbent and four-time champion, Pete Sampras, whom he has never
beaten before.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order, but the British can't help themselves: they
have already been screaming and waving their miniature Union Jacks,
and now, with the moment near at hand, they're just about kneeling
and praying to the tennis gods to shine on their 23-year-old
favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   Henmania, as the affliction is known here at Wimbledon, where
the host nation hasn't been able to boast of a home-grown champion
since Fred Perry hoisted the trophy in 1936, is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Henman has been putting up with the alternate adulation and
devastation of the British public ever since he made his
breakthrough run to the 1996 quarterfinals. He even inspired a
frenzy back in 1995 when, as a bony, whiskerless 20-year-old
prospect, he shamed himself by accidentally hitting a ballgirl with
an angrily walloped missile during a doubles match and found
himself thrown out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That was the same year Sampras, then as now the defending
champion, had already thumped Henman out of the singles competition
in straight sets in the second round. Henman, son of an Oxford
attorney, went home to work on keeping a stiff upper lip in his
matches and adding a 130-mph serve to his repertory. Sampras went
on to capture the 1995 championship, the second of his three
consecutive titles here. They haven't met since, but they have
enjoyed each other's company on the practice court.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sampras, the British No. 2 (he lost his place in
the pecking order when sonic-serving Greg Rusedski drifted across
the Atlantic Ocean from Canada and took up residency in London) is
one of the most complete players in the game. When it comes to
Rusedski and Henman, Sampras is slightly prejudiced in the latter's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember playing him four years ago, and he's just a lot
more powerful now,'' Sampras said of Henman, who is still a bit of
a stringbean at 6 feet 1 inch, 155 pounds. But he's a hardy
stringbean. ``He's serving very, very big,'' said Sampras, ``and
he's got a really good all-round court game. He does everything
very well, and there's not that many players that have that.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach his first Grand Slam semifinal after sinking in
straight sets in the quarterfinals for the past two years, the
12th-seeded Henman upset sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter, the 1997 U.S.
Open champion, and third-seeded Petr Korda, this year's Australian
Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in the quarters again for the third year running, I
think I was anxious to go further this year; I think I was in
control of every aspect of my game,'' said Henman, whose Wimbledon
pedigree stretches through the family tree: his grandfather Henry
Billington made six appearances here; and one of his grandmothers
was the last woman to serve underarm.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the enemy is now Sampras, the odds on Henman's
winning Wimbledon have improved to 8-1. That's a far cry from the
odds he faced when he made his debut here with a first-round exit
in 1994, when the odds of Elvis' being alive were 250-1 and the
odds of a British man's winning this championship were 1,000-1.
Henman has not told anyone to bet on him, but he's not conceding
anything, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you're aware that he's the best grass-court player
in the world at the moment, and I think the way he's come through
his five matches has been pretty effortless,'' Henman said of the
top-seeded Sampras. ``I know it's going to be my toughest test so
far, but having said that, I definitely feel I've got a good
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who has an equal in Henman when it comes to displaying
a dearth of on-court emotion, said he didn't care if the entire
Center Court crowd waved flags and said prayers on Henman's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting them obviously to be rooting for Tim,'' said
Sampras, whose favorite matches have been those where he took on
Boris Becker and his adoring German public in Germany. ``This event
will be watched all over England and all over the world, but I feel
like I'm ready. Hopefully I can get off to a good start and put the
crowd out of the match, but it's still one-on-one, and I think Tim
knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal, 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia,
a two-time Wimbledon runner-up intent on shedding his reputation as
the best current player never to win a Grand Slam, takes on
ninth-seeded Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion intent
on proving he has more than one Slam title in him. Ivanisevic leads
that rivalry, 8-2, and has beaten the erratic Dutchman in their
last six meetings. &QL;

 &HT;    Firefighters struggle at `ground zero'
 &HT;    By Mike Williams and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORMOND BEACH, Fla._Pastor Roy Hargrave stood in the choking
smoke, watching as a forest service helicopter swooped only yards
overhead, dumping bucket after bucket of water on the wildfire
swarming through the trees a quarter mile from his Riverbend
Community Church in Ormond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ground zero right now,'' Hargrave said, mopping his
brow. ``But these firefighters have done an unbelievable job.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were dozens of ground zeroes Thursday as firefighters
struggled to contain the wildfires that rode stiff winds and
threatened the homes of 35,000 evacuees in a three-county area
along Florida's central Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The fire and smoke forced postponement of Saturday's Pepsi 400
stock car race and closure of a 125-mile stretch of I-95 from
Jacksonville to Titusville for much of the day Thursday. Northbound
lanes north of St. Augustine were reopened Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles toured Volusia and Brevard counties Thursday
and asked federal officials for more heavy equipment to create fire
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have almost every heavy bulldozer in the South,'' Chiles
said. ``Now we are reaching outside of that area. It looks like
this is going to be another day of trying to contain the fire and
trying to protect homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast _ hot and dry _ didn't bode well for
firefighters. Lightning from a round of afternoon thunderstorms
Wednesday sparked about 70 new fires, state officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the weather for the next few days, it's not a good
sign,'' said Ormond Beach Fire Chief Barry Baker. ``We've got more
west winds. It's incredible the way these fires are moving. It's a
pretty awesome sight.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening, the series of wildfires, which began
Memorial Day, had burned 283,000 acres and damaged or destroyed at
least 96 homes and 57 other structures statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach Mayor Bud Asher, whose mother-in-law and
father-in-law were among those evacuated from Ormond Beach, said
firefighters held their own Thursday against blazes that forced the
evacuation of a subdivision and apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytona Beach is safe,'' Asher said Thursday. ``Right now, I
think we've got a pretty good hold on things. For now, the worst of
it is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The city, however, cancelled its Fourth of July celebration,
including the annual fireworks display. The pyrotechnics are fired
from the end of the boardwalk pier toward the Atlantic Ocean. Asher
said smoke from the fires, which has limited visibility in the
area, would have caused a crowd control problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to tie up police for a huge fireworks
display,'' Asher said.
</P>
<P>
   Race officials had expected a crowd up to 250,000. Several
thousand already had arrived in RVs, trucks and trailers just
before qualifying. Many left Thursday, jamming westbound lanes of
I-4 toward Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Acrid smoke plumes forced the closure of I-95 between
Jacksonville and the Bee Line Expressway south of Titusville.
Officials also closed U.S. 1, the other north-south artery on the
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Bruns, spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency
Management, had no estimate how long the highways would be closed.
``No one knows how long the emergency will run,'' Burns said. ``We
don't have a long distance line that extends into the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   At least four new areas were evacuated _ two in northern Brevard
County northwest of Titusville, one in St. Johns County west of
U.S. 1 south of St. Augustine and one in a Flagler County
subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines reported delays up to 30 minutes to Jacksonville
and Daytona Beach. Delta has buses standing by in Orlando if
flights are rerouted there because of poor visibility on the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagler County Jail in Bunnell was evacuated. Those charged
with felonies were transferred while inmates charged with
misdemeanors were released, a deputy said. The county's E-911
service based in Bunnell was moved to Palm Coast.
</P>
<P>
   While the most dangerous blazes burned on Florida's Atlantic
coast, the state also reported 150 acres on fire in the
Apalachicola National Forest. Sporadic blazes were reported
throughout the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy Space Center, east of Titusville and separated
from the mainland by the Banana River, officials monitored smoke to
make sure it didn't contaminate ``clean rooms'' where elements of
the space station are being constructed. Filters not normally
monitored over holiday weekends will be watched, said NASA
spokesman Bruce Buckingham. Evacuations and the shutdown of I-95
caused more than 125 Boeing employees to miss work Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Buckingham can look out his window and see the launch
pad 3 miles away. Smoke obscured his view Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a big fog bank rolled through,'' Buckingham said.
``The smoke is everywhere outside. It's like sitting in front of a
campfire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Titusville Thursday at the Dixie Crossroads seafood
restaurant, there wasn't much of a lunch crowd. ``I can't imagine
that anybody would want to eat,'' said general manager Kathy
Shaeffer, evacuated from her house in Mims two days ago. ``We're
totally devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff brought batches of its signature rock shrimp and corn
fritters to firefighters along with 15 coolers of cold drinks. She
said it's the least they could do for men and women putting in
20-hour days in nearly 100-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You labor to breathe,'' said Shaeffer. ``At night, you see the
sky glowing in one area and glowing in another area, so you know
it's two distinct areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Williams normally waits half an hour to be seated at the
Dixie Crossroads but had his pick of tables Thursday. Williams,
director at the North Brevard Funeral Home, has taken to calling
the area north of Titusville the ``war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   During funerals, ``white ash flies all over,'' Williams said. On
the roads and interstates, he passes evacuees _ ``people in the
median strip with half their stuff on top of their cars.''

   Back in Ormond Beach, Richard Palmer, 58, packed his belongings
and is ready to evacuate at a moment's notice.

   ``It's nerve-wracking,'' Palmer said. ``It's not like a
hurricane where you can see it coming for days and know when it
will arrive. There's no rain, and nothing changes. It's just more
smoke, more ashes falling out of the sky.

 &HT;    Employee sues and denies claim that he a viewed pornographic
images on the net
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO _ A former Raytheon Systems employee has filed a wrongful
termination lawsuit, claiming that he was fired after company
officials falsely claimed that he spent four to six hours a day
calling up pornographic images on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. White is seeking unspecified damages from Raytheon in
the suit, filed on his behalf in Waco's 74th State District Court
by Waco attorney John L. Bates.
</P>
<P>
   White, a 23-year-old aerospace engineer, was fired Jan. 29 and
told that it was because he spent from four to six hours a day
during a two-week period in October 1997 ``watching pornographic
presentations on the Internet,'' according to his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   White alleges that he told his supervisors that he was away from
his work station attending classes without access to a computer for
at least two of the days they say he was calling up Internet porn.
</P>
<P>
   He claims others must have used his computer password to log
onto a computer to make it appear that he was using the computer
when he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiff further alleges that he had been working on a part
of a project that previously two people had handled and had allowed
to fall behind schedule,'' the suit claims. ``Plaintiff alleges
that with the amount of work done and bringing the program up to
date that there was no way he could have done the work he was doing
and at the same time watch pornographic material four to six hours
per day on the computer screen.''
</P>
<P>
   White failed in an appeal of his termination, according to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Curtis, a Raytheon spokesman, said Raytheon has a ``standing
policy'' to not comment on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   White alleges Raytheon officials were ``grossly negligent'' in
the manner in which they investigated the reported Internet
incident and in the security of the computer system.
</P>
<P>
   He also alleges that his professional reputation has been
damaged and that Raytheon officials slandered and libeled him by
making the reason for his termination public, at least throughout
the Waco plant.

   Italy enters &QL; 
wolves' den &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Rivalry with France &QL; 
transcends Cup match
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ Two days ago, there were a pair of bitter rivals and World
Cup arch-enemies fighting it out into the night, giving the Cup
high drama and tense moments.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly where we pick up the Cup now, although the
names and stakes have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a memorable England-Argentina clash finished off
group and round-of-16 play, today it will be Italy-France with
similar stories to tell at 80,000-seat Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it is Italy and France,'' Italy forward Christian Vieri
said, ``we have no secrets. We don't care if it is the World Cup or
any other tournament. We have to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance to advance to the semifinals of the World Cup has
brought even more attention to these traditional border rivals who
have played some of the more intense, more memorable soccer games
in history.
</P>
<P>
   The series dates to the 1930s, with each nation claiming
important victories either in the World Cup or European Cup. Since
1980, when Italy and France met at the European Cup, each team has
won three meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though both coaches for today's game have tried to downplay
the rivalry, the history of this series is of hard tackles, hard
feelings and end-to-end action.
</P>
<P>
   French fans consider the Italians pompous and conceited.
Italians call the French team, which is known as the ``brave
roosters'' in France, the ``little chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is a series that inevitably brings out the best efforts
from the individual stars and often hinges on a single moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into the wolves' den,'' Italy coach Cesare Maldini
said. ``France is not new to us. I can honestly say that the
tournament has been great so far, but the best matches are still to
come, beginning with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are considered among the favorites to win the Cup
championship. Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca went so far as
to say that the winner today will go on to win the Cup on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played hundreds of matches in front of hostile crowds
before,'' Pagliuca said. ``We know we'll be surrounded by French
supporters, but we don't mind. Playing at home should be an
advantage for France, but we suspect it could also turn against
them at difficult stages of the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the intrigue of today's match is that seven expected
French starters play professionally in Italy. Many Italian players
know players from the other side, but they are not exactly friends.
</P>
<P>
   Several Italian players resent French stars playing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important match of my career because we know
them so well and the semifinals are on the line,'' Italy's Fabio
Cannavaro said. ``Ever since they've been in the Italian League,
they've begun to think like winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Many French supporters, meanwhile, believe that Italian club
owners are invading their country and scooping up its best players.
</P>
<P>
   For these rival nations, it has become a question of, which came
first, the ``brave roosters'' or the Italian League?
</P>
<P>
   France considers itself superior no matter whre its best
players sign contracts. Still, the two biggest French stars,
Zinedine Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff, play in the Serie A of the
Italian League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zidane is the best playmaker in the world, as we've seen when
he's played in Italy,'' Maldini said. ``We will need to adopt
suitable tactics to contain him. He has all the qualities that
great players have but I've been reading what he's been saying, and
he's fairly confident France will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Zidane has predicted a victory in his first game back
since being suspended for two games for pulling a red card.
</P>
<P>
   But Italy has won the last two meetings between these nations
and has quite a lineup of stars itself, from Vieri, the leading
goal-scorer of the Cup thus far with five, to Alessandro Del Piero,
Dino Baggio and Roberto Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a typical Italy-France meeting,'' Vieri
said. ``Since they will be playing at home in front of their own
crowd, they will have all the responsibility and all the pressure
on them. They are going to be obliged to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will counterattack and win. We are inspired to win this
game. The Italian attack is the strongest in the world, and I think
we will show it against them. We are better than them.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepare to pick up Cup action where it left off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There always is a sense of tension in the air when we play
Italy,'' France coach Aime Jacquet said. ``Hopefully, by the end of
the day we will be able to relieve that tension.''

FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN OF ALYDAR CONVICTED OF LYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A former night watchman at Kentucky's financially
ailing Calumet Farm was convicted Thursday of lying to a federal
grand jury on questions relating to the critical injury of Alydar,
history's most heavily insured racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Most jurors agreed that Calumet executives schemed to injure
Alydar, who was euthanized two days later, but said that they did
not believe defendant Alton Stone was part of any such conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was investigating allegations of fraud
surrounding now-defunct First City Bankcorporation of Texas. Alydar
was collateral on $50 million in First City loans to Calumet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much sympathy for him (Stone),'' said trial jury
forewoman Sheila Donley. ``It was difficult to just look at (the
inconsistencies) his statements and not think, `but why.' All we
could consider was that he lied.''
</P>
<P>
   All the jurors said Stone was just in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, 39, faces up to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
He will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge David Hittner on Sept.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Stone substituted for the regular night watchman on Nov. 13,
1990.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of lying about who asked him to fill in for the
regular night watchman and where he was between 9:45 and 10:15
p.m., when Alydar suffered a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Stone told the grand jury last summer that Harold ``Cowboy''
Kipp, who normally had the night watch at the stallion barn, asked
him to substitute.
</P>
<P>
   But Kipp testified that farm management directed him to take the
evening off, and that he never talked to Stone or anyone else about
filling in.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also told the grand jury that he went to the snack bar to
get a soft drink about 9:30 or 9:40 p.m. and returned 10 minutes
later to find Alydar injured.
</P>
<P>
   But government witness Keed Highley testified that he discovered
the injured horse _ minutes after spotting Stone's truck pull away
from the stallion barn.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors John Willis and Jamie Whisonant said Stone was not part
of a conspiracy to hurt Alydar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see a motive,'' said Whisonant. ``We didn't see any
gain for him. He's (now) a construction worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Farm execs may have asked Stone, actually a groom at the time,
to fill-in that night, figuring he would do a poor job of
performing the unfamiliar duties, jurors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they probably knew he was not very attentive,'' said
Donley.
</P>
<P>
   Stone received some notoriety when he was interviewed for the
book ``Wild Ride,'' which chronicled the rise and fall of Calumet
Farm.
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout, he was interviewed by the author about
the events that transpired the evening he said he found the injured
Alydar sweating and whining in his stall.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Julia Hyman theorized that Calumet Farm's owners
arranged Alydar's injury to collect a hefty insurance claim and
stave off financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   First City _ itself then on the verge of collapse _ loaned
millions to Calumet during the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After Alydar's death, Calumet's owners collected $36.5 million
in insurance claims, with $20.5 million of that going to First
City.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people, including former First City vice chairman
Frank Cihak, have been convicted of fraud in connection with other
loans by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said Stone lied to the grand jury to cover up the plot to
defraud the bank and the insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong trial revealed little about the nature of the
underlying fraud investigation of First City.
</P>
<P>
   But Stone's conviction _ and heavy hints by Hyman during the
trial _ raised the likelihood of more indictments from the bank
fraud probe that has spanned most of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Taylor, who writes about the thoroughbred industry for
the Lexington Herald-Leader, said Alydar's death and the farm's
ultimate bankruptcy have been fodder for the rumor mill for nearly
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But, Taylor said, the trial shed no new light on the
circumstances surrounding Alydar's injury _ save Highley's claim it
was he who found the injured stallion.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians and the insurance adjuster who OK'd payment on the
$36 million insurance claim testified the break in Alydar's leg was
probably accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no known eyewitness, circumstantial evidence
led the vets and adjuster to speculate that the temperamental
stallion kicked the stall door, breaking a rusty bolt that held the
door securely against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Alydar, who ran a close second to Affirmed in the 1978 Triple
Crown races, broke his right, hind cannon bone when his leg became
lodged in the resulting gap, the witnesses testified.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement after the verdict, defense attorney
Chris Goldsmith contended his client was railroaded by an obsessive
prosecutor who has carried on the First City probe for years.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors overwhelmingly blamed Stone's conviction on
Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   Juror Ted Perez said Stone seemed like a hard-working man who
would not be involved in any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't know anything about him from his lawyer,'' Perez
said. ``We didn't hear from any character witnesses, we had nothing
to go on from the defense.''

SOLIS IN RACING SLUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The mystery of the summer is the
disappearance of Alex Solis from the Hollywood Park top 10, a year
after he was the track's leading jockey.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is simple bad luck: Going into Thursday's races,
Solis had only 11 winners in 161 tries, but 38 seconds and 25
thirds. He ranked 14th in victories, but third in in-the-money
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If half of those seconds had won, it would have been a great
meet,'' said Solis, who believes he's riding as well as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is that the 34-year-old Panamanian isn't getting
the quality of horses he rode before spending much of March and
April out of town, competing in rich races in Dubai and Saudi
Arabia and on the Triple Crown trail. He is, after all, the same
Solis who won six straight major Southern California riding titles
in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Solis, interviewed Thursday in the Hollywood Park jockeys room,
refused to criticize the trainers and owners who pass him over,
though he said it's ``nice when somebody stays loyal to you.''
</P>
<P>
   But his agent, Scott McClellan, said he thinks trainers are
finding it easy to blame Solis for defeats because his low winning
percentage ``magnifies'' bad racing luck.
</P>
<P>
   Solis called it his worst slump in 10 years but said he feels
better since winning his first stakes race of the meet with Son of
a Pistol in Sunday's Triple Bend Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to put it this way, but I'm glad it happened,'' he said
of the slump. ``Sometimes you get too comfortable, because you do
so well for so long. These things happen for a very good reason, to
give you the drive back.''
</P>
<P>
   Upping the ante: No surprise, considering the success of
Hollywood Park's guaranteed $1 million pick-six on June 14, the
track will try it again by guaranteeing a $1.5 million pool on July
18.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a mandatory payout that Saturday, meaning five
winners will be rewarded like six if nobody has a perfect ticket.
Also, the track will pay a $500,000 bonus if only one ticket has
all six winners.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the guarantee produced a Hollywood Park-record $3.3
million pick-six pool, paying $53,357 to each of 35 perfect
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: The Beverly Hills Handicap, the meet's championship
race for turf fillies and mares, heads a three-stakes card on the
Fourth of July at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, the nation's top-ranked filly, is skipping the 1\-mile
race because trainer Neil Drysdale wouldn't accept 125 pounds.
Leading an eight-horse field are Sixy Saint, whose four-race
winning streak includes a victory over Fiji, and Squeak, an English
import who was third to Fiji in the Gamely Handicap last time out.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Saturday card: the American Handicap, a 1[-mile turf
race that looks tougher than last year for defending champion El
Angelo, and the Playa del Rey, a 3-year-old sprint featuring
Souvenir Copy.
</P>
<P>
   Anything for a win: When Laffit Pincay surpasses Bill
Shoemaker's 8,833 victories, nobody will be able to say he coasted
to the record.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the 51-year-old Pincay has ridden at 117 pounds on a
middleweight's frame. But last week, trainer Richard Mandella asked
him to lose a pound to ride Supercilious in the Fran's Valentine
Stakes. Pincay did it, and they won by a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really made an effort to lose the pound,'' Pincay said. ``I
can do it, but if I stayed like this I'd probably be weak tomorrow.
It was sure worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, winning at a strong 18percent clip at Hollywood Park,
soon will draw within 200 winners of Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be at Prairie Meadows, near Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday
to ride Pacificbounty in the $300,000 Cornhusker Breeders' Cup
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Bob bashing: Also getting lighter is the Bob Baffert bandwagon.
Since he engaged in verbal spats with Skip Away trainer Sonny Hine
and Hollywood Park management, and since he withdrew Silver Charm
from a second million-dollar race, Baffert is taking some knocks
from the once-fawning press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act is growing old,'' columnist Bill Handleman of the
Asbury Park (N.J.) Press wrote last week. ``No one believes a word
Baffert says anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Handleman summed up the trainer's appeal this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Baffert may be perfectly in sync with these dramatically
shallow times we live in. Not only that, he's smart enough to
understand what it takes to become a master of his small universe.
Which is why it seemed like he was holding a press conference every
15 minutes leading up to the (Kentucky) Derby,'' Handleman wrote.

OUTBREAK OF TAINTED TEXAS OYSTERS BREAKS NATIONAL RECORD 

</HEADLINE>

By CINDY HORSWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Health officials Thursday continued adding up
reports of people sickened from eating raw Galveston Bay oysters as
the total vaulted past the national record with no sign of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The people who make their living harvesting the popular
shellfish from the bay were also counting as they watched their
financial losses mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of people out of work,'' said Lisa Halili,
chairwoman of the Gulf Oyster Industry Council.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, health officials had recorded 245 people who
have become ill after eating raw Galveston Bay oysters contaminated
with the bacterium ``Vibrio parahaemolyticus.'' That total far
outdistanced the previous record for an outbreak of the illness,
which was recorded last summer when 208 people became ill and one
died from eating raw oysters in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   That outbreak started in mid-July and the oyster harvesting ban
there did not end until Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The number of reported illnesses from the tainted Galveston Bay
oysters continues to mount at a fast clip, said Kirk Wiles,
spokesman for the Texas Department of Health's seafood safety
division.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's total reflected an increase of 58 new cases from the
previous day, when the total had jumped by 59 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas oysters have been recalled and the oyster houses have
voluntarily quit harvesting as of June 25,'' Wiles said. ``We have
also worked hard to alert consumers that Galveston Bay oysters
should only be eaten after being thoroughly cooked because that
kills the bacteria. We hope the number of reported cases begins to
drop soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the reported cases, 206 were recorded in Texas, 36 in Florida
and 3 in Tennessee. Restaurants that had received shipments of the
oysters also were alerted in California, Colorado, Louisiana and
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Although Galveston Bay oystermen voluntarily stopped harvesting
from the 43 oyster beds where harvesting goes on this time of year,
some wholesalers Thursday expressed concern about the accuracy of
some illness reports. They noted that people can learn the symptoms
from media reports and then call a hot-line number that has been
set up to take reports of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of ``Vibrio parahaemolyticus'' include diarrhea,
abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, vomiting and headache. The illness
usually lasts up to seven days and is rarely fatal unless the
victim has an immune disorder or liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   People who have suffered such symptoms within a day or two of
eating raw oysters from the bay have been asked to call state
officials at 1-888-883-9997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We harvest and sell about a half-million oysters a day by
ourselves alone. About 90 percent of the product is eaten raw,''
said Halili, 37, of San Leon. ``If this product is so unhealthy, we
should be seeing a lot more sickness than this.''
</P>
<P>
   About 22 of the reported cases have been confirmed through stool
samples and the rest through responses on an epidemiological
questionnaire, state health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Halili and her husband, John, who operate Johnny's Oyster and
Shrimp, worry about how the Texas oyster industry will recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bills are $6,000 to $8,000 a month,'' she said. ``My
husband and I can't go anywhere else and recoup that. I'm loaning
money to my captains, deckhands, packagers and processors to help
them through the crisis, but I can't continue this forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Oysters from the 43 Galveston Bay beds are being tested, as is
water from those sites. The oystermen have voluntarily suspended
harvesting until test results are back.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nelson, 62, a wholesaler from Smith Point, said much of the
difficulty lies in not knowing why the bacterium has shown up in
such large amounts recently and how long the problem will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's killing us,'' he said. ``The longer it goes, the
worse it gets. We've been down five or six days now and our
employees can't hang around indefinitely. Most of us live from pay
day to pay day.

   ``We've gone through floods and oil spills and everything
else,'' Nelson said ``Nothing's been this bad, because we knew what
to expect. We fear we're going to lose the confidence of the
consumer for our product over this.''
</P>
<P>
   State health officials stressed that this bacterium occurs
naturally in even the cleanest bodies of water and tends to
increase in numbers during warm summer months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not come from pollution or sewage runoff; it's just
there,'' said Wiles. ``We need to research what is causing the
bacteria levels to increase to the extent that they never have
before.''
</P>
<P>
   While some speculate that the increase is linked to the hot, dry
weather, Wiles said he has seen other long, hot summers during his
22 years working for the state but never had seen this happen.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sample of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said
scientists are still seeking the cause of the Northwest Pacific
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the regulators and experts looked at it. The basic
assumption in the end was, we need to know more about this
organism,'' Sample said. ``But the (Centers for Disease Control)
report thought it was related to the hot temperatures. El Nino had
caused our ocean temperature to rise two or three degrees above
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas oyster fishermen worry about what the future
holds for Galveston Bay, which plays the lead role in the state's
oyster industry.
</P>
<P>
   The bay supplies 87 percent of all the oysters harvested each
year in Texas, producing 3.4 million pounds of meat worth $8.7
million in 1997, said Page Campbell, a commercial fishery
specialist with the state Parks and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say more than half the oysters eaten raw in the
nation come from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the oyster houses understand that we want to solve the
problem together and they have done the responsible thing by
closing the bay even though its disrupting their economic
livelihood,'' Wiles said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes tests done on samples of meat, water and soil taken
from the bay will provide answers to the question of how bad the
problem is and how long it will last. He said the test results
should be completed by next week.

 &HT;    Davies uses 68 to tie for lead
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Expecting to be packing her suitcase by later
today, Laura Davies has been forced to revise her plans. Somehow
pulling a 3-under-par 68 out of the no-confidence funk that has
been her season, Davies Thursday assumed a share of the first-round
lead with Kim Williams in the U.S. Women's Open at the Blackwolf
Run Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   One shot off the lead at 69 were 20-year-old Se Ri Pak of Korea,
Leslie Spalding and Dinah Shore winner Pat Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's Nancy Lopez, trying to win her first U.S. Women's Open
after 48 LPGA wins, shot a 6-over 77. Defending champion Alison
Nicholas of England opened with a 78.
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended at 8:44 p.m. CDT with two threesomes
remaining on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davies, with missed five cuts this year and a mostly
frozen putter, has not declared herself cured, at least for a day
the 1987 Open champion combined her typical power with some
atypical putting prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel pretty much the same way,'' said Davies, who leads the
LPGA tour in cynicism. ''I am serious. I'm so low on confidence.
The whole thing has just been a downward spiral. . . . .Generally,
I've messed up 90 percent of the rounds of golf I've had this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pounding her 3-iron off the tee for drives of up to 260 yards,
Davies hit only two drivers Thursday, but made four birdies and a
bogey, hit 15 greens and 13 of 14 fairways.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a long way to go,'' Davies said, ''and I'm just hoping
I'll be playing all four rounds. I guess I'd have to have a really
bad day now (to miss the cut), wouldn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, of Bethesda, Md., who has never won an LPGA event but
played in the second-last group last year at Pumpkin Ridge and tied
for 19th, wore a back brace for much of her Thursday round,
suffering from disk problems since January. She had not played in
three weeks and ''I was really doubtful that I would even play
here. I was at home basically laying on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams would like nothing more than to this week alter the
highlight of her biographical sketch. She's known mostly for
getting hit in the neck by a stray bullet in 1994 while trailing by
a stroke in the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for sixth at 1-under 70 are LPGA leading moneywinner Donna
Andrews, Jacqueline Gallagher-Smith, Barb Mucha, Atlanta winner
Liselotte Neumann and amateur Brenda Corrie Kuehn.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Open winner Annika Sorenstam of Sweden regrouped after
a triple-bogey on the fifth hole and compiled an even-par 71.
Australian Karrie Webb had a 76, two shots better than Atlanta's
Rosie Jones.

 &HT;    Lopez quest for title on life support
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheely
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wisc. _ Nancy Lopez's quest for a U.S. Women's Open
trophy probably won't be satisfied this week at Blackwolf Run. Here
in the land of posh plumbing fixtures, Lopez turned on the faucet
in Thursday's first round and came up dry.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the ball she rinsed on the 12th hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of a day for the winner of 48 LPGA tournaments
from Albany, Ga. In the tournament she most desperately covets,
Lopez left herself inches from desperation in today's second round.
Following an opening 77 Thursday, Lopez could be fighting to make
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Lopez birdied the 18th to both help her round and
build some momentum for today. She battled poor club selection and
missed greens all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in myself, but I played the last few holes
really well _ the way I thought I was going to be playing all
day,'' said Lopez, 41. ``The big thing here is hitting greens, and
when you're chipping all day, it's hard to make pars.''
</P>
<P>
   Still optimistic despite her poor start, Lopez said, ``I look
forward to tomorrow. I know there are some birdies out there for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam regroups after triple-bogey
</P>
<P>
   For a while Thursday, Annika Sorenstam didn't like the building
scenario. After trying for a three-peat in the U.S. Women's Open
last year and then failing to make the cut, Sorenstam Thursday
triple-bogeyed the 5th hole and bogeyed the 7th to stand 3-over
after seven holes. After never quite crawling out of the Pumpkin
Ridge rough in 1997, this time she recovered impressively. Birdies
on 8, 11, 16 and 18 allowed an even-par 71 and decent position. Did
thoughts of last year's disaster enter her mind after hitting into
the water on the 5th with a fat 7-iron? ``Yeah, for a few
seconds,'' Sorenstam said. ``But I told myself, 'It's only
Thursday. Let's try and get this behind you and go from here.' I
promised myself I won't give up and I won't. I'm going to keep
grinding and grinding. That was the lesson I learned from last
year.'' ... Meanwhile, the defending champion caught the full
effect of what ailed Sorenstam last year. England's Alison
Nicholas, who beat Lopez by a shot in 1997, could end up joining
her on the cut list. With a back-nine 42, Nicholas opened her
defense with a 7-over 78. ``I mean, I haven't been playing very
well recently, anyway,'' Nicholas said. ``I suppose I just got a
bit tight?'' Asked whether she meant ``tense,'' Nicholas said,
``Whatever word you want to use. You're the journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak has a knack for majors
</P>
<P>
   Korea's Se Ri Pak opened with a 69 Thursday, reconfirming her
ability to perform in the major championships, regardless of what
she has been doing elsewhere. Although Pak, 20, hasn't finished
higher than 26th in the four events since winning the McDonald's
LPGA Championship, a tough course and added pressure inspired her
Thursday to a 69, placing her one shot off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just feel more comfortable in the big tournaments,'' said
Pak, who bogeyed the 7th hole afer a birdie at the 6th and closed
with 12 straight pars.
</P>
<P>
   Record crowds clog traffic
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jams at TPC Sugarloaf during the BellSouth Classic in
May were nothing compared to the mess Thursday leading into
Blackwolf Run. On a day when a record crowd of 21,000 attended,
cars were backed up five miles from the course on Interstate 43 and
Highway 23 because of delays from moving cars into parking lots.
Attempting to help the jam-up immediately, the USGA dispatched
mowers to clear surrounding pasture areas to accomodate an
additional 1,000 cars. By noon Thursday parking spaces for 15,000
spectators were gone. No players missed tee times due to the
delays, but it made for some anxious moments. ... Patty Schremmer
of Sarasota, Fla., withdrew prior to Thursday's round because of a
freak back injury. Playing in a Jimmy Buffet pro-am in Atlanta
prior to the Women's Open, she apparently was hugged by a playing
partner, causing the injury. ... Sweden's Helen Alfredsson aced
Blackwolf Run's 152-yard 8th hole with an 8-iron.

HIGHER-LEVEL LAPSES FOUND IN SKI LIFT CRASH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to change `the captain' to `the pilot'; subs 6th
graf to fix typo in Englewood) (bl) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Failures by the Marine Corps and the Air Force to
pass along crucial information cast ``substantial doubt'' on
whether the captain of a plane that struck a ski lift cable in the
Italian Alps in February could be convicted in a court-martial, a
hearing officer found in a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearing officer, Lt. Col. Ronald L. Rodgers, said the
pilot of the Marine Corps jet should be tried on the most serious
possible charges in the accident that killed 20 people and caused a
rift between Italy and the United States over prosecution of the
four-man crew.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers made his recommendations after presiding over hearings
in May and in June, when evidence about the accident was presented.
While his report is advisory, it represents an official
acknowledgment of major lapses of people higher in the chain of
command _ many of whom do not face any charges in connection with
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``systemic errors,'' the report detailed numerous
breakdowns in communications within the Marine Corps electronic
warfare squadron to which the plane belonged, within the Air Force
and between those two agencies. It also cited evidence of
``noncriminally negligent pilot behavior.'' The report recommended
a court-martial for the navigator, on a slightly less serious
charge, and no court-martial for two other officers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, stationed at the Aviano air base as part of the
``Deliberate Guard'' mission over Bosnia, was on a low-altitude
training mission in the Alps flown by Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of
Mission Viejo, Calif. Next to him in the cockpit was Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y., who had no flight controls but
planned the mission and handled navigation aloft.
</P>
<P>
   In the rear cockpit of the plane, an EA-6B Prowler, were Capt.
Chandler Seagraves, 28, of Nineveh, Ind., and Capt. William Raney,
27, of Englewood, Colo. They had no view out the front and only
limited information on the plane's altitude and position.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a Marine Investigation Board recommended charges
against all of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony of Col. Tom Blickensderfer, a board member and
director of operations at the Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry
Point, N.C., where the Prowlers are based, contributed to Rodgers'
conclusions that other factors played a role in the accident.
Blickensderfer said he had ``flown'' a computer-based simulator
over the route as part of the investigation. The terrain, he
testified, would have caused the pilot to see an optical illusion
of greater altitude than was actually the case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rodgers said that ``reasonable grounds exist that support
the conclusion that Ashby was overly aggressive in the execution of
this training mission; that he thereafter failed to take
appropriate steps to determine the safety of his altitude in the
mishap valley, and, that those factors were significant causative
factors in the tragedy which resulted.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was reasonable to argue that ``Captain Ashby placed
himself in the dilemma he confronted.'' Even though the group of
six cables did not appear on his map, he bore down much too fast
and too low to do anything about it, the colonel noted.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers said Ashby should be charged with involuntary
manslaughter, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years
imprisonment. He recommended that Schweitzer, the navigator, be
charged with negligent homicide, which is punishable by up to three
years. Both should also be charged with dereliction of duty, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision rests with Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine
Corps Forces Atlantic in Norfolk, who has authority to determine
what charges, if any, the crew would face at a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said, ``they need somebody to go
to trial,'' because of the international sensitivity of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers put some of the blame on the Air Force, which has units
stationed permanently at Aviano and was supposed to provide
information on local flight rules to the Marine squadrons that came
through on six-month rotations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the flaws enumerated by Rodgers were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Air Force's 31st Fighter Wing created a ``pilot aid''
intended for mission planning and gave copies to the Marines. But
the most current version at the time of the accident did not
mention a 2,000-foot restriction that had taken effect months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   _ The squadron's officer in charge of scheduling missions
photocopied information on flights over Italy, including one with
the 2,000-foot restriction. But ``he apparently never digested its
contents, or the importance thereof,'' the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency that prepared detailed charts of northern Italy
used by the Marines, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency,
copied information on aerial obstructions from an Italian chart
drawn on the scale of 1-250,000. But, Colonel Rodgers said, other
maps, not those, mark aerial obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force received a copy of a map using the scale of
1-500,000, which noted the obstruction, in April 1996, but the 31st
Fighter Wing was unaware of that, the report said.

MILESTONE NO MATTER TO MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Though he dismissed its significance, Casey
Martin reached another milestone with his golf cart Thursday while
shooting a 71 at the Canon Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who won a court case for the right to use a cart on the
Nike Tour this season and in the U.S. Open two weeks ago, became
the first golfer to ride a cart in a PGA Tour event Thursday
morning. He did it when he rode down the fairway of the 462-yard
10th hole, his starting hole, at the TCP River Highlands course.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who needs a cart because he suffers from a rare vascular
affliction in his right leg, earned a sponsor's exemption for this
tournament, where he attracted Tiger Woods-like galleries even
though his 1-over-par 71 left him seven strokes off the lead after
one round.
</P>
<P>
   He had two birdies, three bogeys and a quick response to
questions about making history on the PGA Tour. ``Never crossed my
mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with Hugh Royer III and Iain Steel, Martin made par on
his 462-yard first hole and made his first birdie three holes
later, when he and chipped from the right of the green at the
523-yard 13th hole to within 10 feet and made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's first bogey came holes later when he gambled and lost.
He attempted to drive the 296-yard 15th, but his drive hit a tree
on the right and dropped into a pile of leaves. He punched out and
his approach landed within 12 feet, but he missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   His other bogeys came at the 431-yard third and the 443-yard
seventh; his other birdie came at the 574-yard sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit the ball well, but I scrambled all day,'' said
Martin, who lives in Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Pete Morgan, is a 35-year-old playing in only his
fourth Tour event since turning pro in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who had to qualify for this event on Monday, lives in
Tampa, Fla., and grew up on Cape Cod. He had no bogeys in shooting
a 64, one shot better than Scott Hoch and Kenny Perry, who were
tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   Martin did not have to qualify here, but no matter what he does
here or next week at the Quad City Classic in Coal Valley, Ill.,
where he has been given another sponsor's exemption, he has little
intention of playing many more events on the PGA Tour this season,
according to his father, King Martin, and his manager, Chris
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to get back on the Nike Tour to get enough money to
make the regular tour,'' King Martin said, alluding to his son's
17th-place ranking on a tour in which the top 15 finishers will
graduate to the PGA Tour next year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has earned $60,401 on the Nike tour, where he has one
victory, the Lakeland Classic, which brought him $40,500.
</P>
<P>
   He can also qualify for the PGA Tour by special temporary
membership if he earns enough money this year to equal the amount
earned last year by the 150th finisher on the official money list.
That amount was $121,273. Martin's PGA Tour earnings this season
are the $34,043 he earned by finishing tied for 23rd in the U.S.
Open last month. &QL;

35,000 MUST FLEE RAGING FIRES IN FLORIDA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TERRY BLOUNT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Surging wildfires Thursday forced 35,000
people from their homes, destroyed scores of buildings and closed
freeways as tourist businesses along the coast tried to salvage
what is normally one of the most lucrative weekends of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths had been reported because of the fires, which have
been raging in several Florida counties for as long as six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 48 hours, about 30,000 people were told to leave
their homes in Volusia County _ mostly from Ormond Beach and
Daytona Beach _ and about 5,000 were ordered to leave Brevard
County, county officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you've ever seen napalm,'' Jerry Lefeniere
told The Associated Press after fleeing his home in Mims. ``The
results of napalm, that's what it looks like out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mother Nature has turned the barbecue up high. It's
really cooked out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, about 1,900 fires have burned more than 425
square miles. In an average year, Florida fires burn less than half
that.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes have damaged or destroyed at least 96 homes and 57
other buildings statewide, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   At least five firefighters were injured in Brevard County _
three of whom suffered second-degree burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 20 mph winds blowing west to east and humidity below
35 percent,'' said Dave Bryon, the Volusia County director of
information. ``That is a deadly combination. It is so dry that
static electricity can start a blaze.''
</P>
<P>
   Record temperatures of 98 degrees to 102 degrees coupled with a
lack of rainfall and windy conditions have caused the fires and the
thick, dark plumes of smoke that have sharply cut visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Roads that normally would be packed with beachgoers were
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 95, the main north-south artery along the Florida
coast, is closed for more than 140 miles from Jacksonville to
Tollroad 528 south of Titusville. More than 30,000 cars were
gridlocked while trying to detour to other routes.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions forced the postponement of the Pepsi 400 at
Daytona International Speedway, an unprecedented occurrence in
NASCAR's 50-year history. The race was to be run Saturday night but
has been rescheduled for Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Many fireworks displays have been canceled for fear they might
spark more blazes.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach is covered with a veil of smoke that has reduced
visibility to less than 100 yards in some locations. The Indigo
Lakes subdivision near the speedway is under mandatory evacuation,
as is most of Ormond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of shelters have been opened at schools and churches to
house families who have been forced to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles canceled a vacation trip to North
Carolina so he could tour the area of the blaze and appeal for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst thing I've ever seen,'' Chiles said in Volusia
County. ``It has gone well beyond Black Friday (the 1985 wildfires
that claimed 200 Florida homes). Florida has never had a situation
like this. It's time for everyone to come together to see what they
can do to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida National Guard has been fully mobilized to join the
emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said National Guard
trooper Chad Jenkins. ``The fire is everywhere. It's all around us.
In some places, the flames are more than 100 feet high.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes are dropping thousands of gallons of fire retardant,
and helicopters drop water wherever new blazes begin. Hundreds of
bulldozers have been brought in to try to build walls to halt the
flames, but high winds have helped the inferno jump barriers and
fire breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Embers blown from the trees start new fires faster than the
workers can put them out.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfires that are burning have five main areas _ the west
side of Ormond Beach, south and west of Daytona Beach, south of
Kissimmee in Osceola County, and west of Melbourne in Brevard
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying our best to protect homes,'' Chiles said.
``That's our top priority. But we need people to leave the
evacuation areas as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   And many fear the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is anybody's guess what is going to happen the next few
days,'' said Chuck Williams, a lieutenant for the Florida Highway
Patrol.

SHERIFF ARPAIJO CAN'T DENY JAIL INMATES `PLAYBOY,' `HUSTLER,' COURT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER AND DENNIS   
 Wagner  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Coffee and smokes are still out. But Miss July may be
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playboy, Hustler'' and other publications showing nudity can't
be kept out of jail inmates' hands by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, according
to a ruling Thursday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel said a ban on such publications could be
used to keep inmates from not only ``Playboy,''but ``National
Geographic,'' art books and medical journals as well.
</P>
<P>
   That, the panel said, would violate inmates' First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio's ban was challenged in 1996 by inmate Jonathan Mauro,
who wanted a ``Playboy'' subscription delivered to his cell. Mauro
is no longer in the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's attorney, Nicholas Hentoff, said Thursday, ``They struck
down the policy _ the whole policy _ as it applies to every inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, a three-judge panel . . . has told Sheriff Arpaio in
no uncertain terms that he can't do anything he wants to his
inmates. There is a rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arpaio on Thursday vowed to fight the ruling, and to appeal
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get ``Playboy''tomorrow,'' he said. ``It's
as simple as that, unless you get out of jail and you go to the
drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving back the `Playboy' and ``Hustler.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jail officials instituted the ban about five years ago in the
name of security.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that magazines like ``Playboy'' are bartered for
goods and contraband, and lead to conflicts among inmates. They're
also used by inmates to intimidate and sexually harass female
employees. Further, the officials say, such pictures should not be
seen by sex offenders, who are working to rehabilitate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When Mauro challenged the ban, Arpaio said he wouldn't back
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can sue all he wants, and I'll tell you what: ``Playboy''
is gone, and it's going to be gone,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   In March, U.S. District Judge Robert Broomfield sided with the
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Broomfield said that preventing fights and
harassment relate to prison security, and that ``the Supreme Court
has held that prison security is a legitimate, and indeed
compelling, penological interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield ruled that there was a ``logical connection'' between
banning sexually explicit materials and preventing problems in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, the 9th Circuit overturned that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The panel noted that, during the legal battle, jail officials
produced affidavits and depositions from jail employees to back up
their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, Hentoff showed Deputy Chief Larry Wendt a
Michelangelo painting of a nude Christ. Would the photo, Hentoff
asked, impact jail security?
</P>
<P>
   Wendt said it could. He offered a scenario in which an inmate
who is an atheist might remark to a Christian inmate, ``look at the
size of the genitals on Jesus Christ. That could incite a fight
between the inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wendt also acknowledged that a picture of a clothed Christ,
which isn't banned, could also spark problems between inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We question whether all materials depicting nudity are
`reasonably likely' to be the cause of violence or a tool of
harassment,'' Judge Betty Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The county, Fletcher wrote, simply didn't prove ``that such a
far reaching prohibition is `reasonably related' to legitimate
penological interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether the county's policy would be
constitutional if applied to ban ``Playboy'' magazine, it is not
constitutional to ban all depictions of frontal nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hentoff said he realizes some will question why a sheriff can't
deny girlie magazines to jail inmates. But the challenge was about
First Amendment rights, not about ``Playboy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Struck, the attorney representing the county, said he will
ask for a re-hearing before the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the panel ``missed the mark'' in analyzing whether there
is a legitimate need to ban materials showing frontal nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Sheriff Joe being bullheaded,'' he said. ``A
very well respected district court judge agreed that this was
constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the panel's ruling that the ban was ``overbroad,'' Struck
said: ``The fact is the plaintiff doesn't want to read ``Art and
Auction'' magazine. He wants to read ``Playboy.'' &QL;

'Fancy making money out of her death,' but of course he's done it
to make money.'' (Jonathan Player/New York Times Photo) *LITE

AVOIDING SOME BUMPS ALONG THE SECTOR ROAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sector funds, which concentrate their holdings in particular
industries, are notoriously volatile. Investing in one can result
in a home run or a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   This is not surprising. After all, if diversifying stock
portfolios can iron out their volatility, then narrowing their
focus to single industries will increase it. And the losses can be
big. Last year, for instance, the Fidelity Precious Metals and
Minerals fund plunged 44.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fidelity Investments, the leader in the field with
40 sector funds, has 1.2 million shareholder accounts in them. The
goal of the investors, of course, is to knock the ball out of the
park.
</P>
<P>
   That is more easily said than done, but Jack Bowers, who edits
the Fidelity Monitor, an independent newsletter in Rocklin, Calif.,
has developed a sector-fund investing system that appears to work.
He has tested it with calculations of how the system would have
performed back to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to buy into a sector, of course, is when it is
undervalued. When an industry group sells at a discount to its
historical valuation, he said, the odds increase that it will beat
the market. Moreover, the discount usually reflects widespread
skepticism _ so that the sector's prices are already depressed,
limiting the downside potential.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what measure of valuation to use. Bowers
discarded price-to-earnings ratios because it is difficult to
compare them from one sector to another. Many industrial and
transportation sectors typically carry below-market ratios, for
example, while pharmaceutical and software companies tend to be
high-priced. The ratio can also be meaningless when many companies
in a sector are not profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of studies started in 1996, Bowers found a better
value measure: movements in industries' price-to-book ratio. For
individual companies, this ratio is calculated by dividing total
market capitalization by balance-sheet listings of cash, factories,
real estate, equipment and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers compares current industry ratios with historical ones.
Industry groups that show up as undervalued are considered good
buys. He updates his valuations twice a year, when Fidelity
releases its sector funds' stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   He figured that during the last eight years, investors who
consistently held Fidelity sector funds in the 10 most undervalued
industries, by this measure, could have earned much more in average
annual returns _ 24.2 percent versus 16.6 percent _ than if they
had invested in the 10 most expensive sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers has also devised a system for timing the sale of sector
funds. First he looks for the 10 most attractive sectors _ those
with the lowest price-to-book ratios relative to their average
ratios over the last five years. He then recommends selling any
sector fund that falls out of this top 10 twice in a row in his
six-month evaluations, moving the proceeds into the cheapest sector
fund on his list.
</P>
<P>
   Why wait six months rather than selling the first time the
sector falls out of the top 10? He says it takes the marketplace
six months to recognize value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a sector is cheap and performs well, it tends to continue
to outperform six months past the point at which it is no longer
considered a good value,'' he said. He surmised that this resulted
from the time lag in upgrades and downgrades issued by brokerage
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In testing his system back to 1990, with the help of comparisons
of companies' records back to 1987, Bowers said he had found that
using the six-month lag would have added three percentage points to
investors' returns.
</P>
<P>
   Under his system, what follows are the cheapest and most
expensive Fidelity Select sector funds now and their percentages of
their historical value. All figures are near or above 100 percent
because the bull market of the last few years has caused companies'
stock values generally to rise faster than their asset values.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 cheapest are: Automotive, 99 percent; Medical Delivery,
107 percent; Biotechnology, 111 percent; Developing Communications,
121 percent; Energy, 124 percent; Leisure, 124 percent;
Construction and Housing, 124 percent; Natural Gas, 129 percent;
Transportation, 129 percent, and Consumer Industries, 131 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 most expensive are: Energy Services, 220 percent;
Regional Banks, 209 percent; Home Finance, 207 percent; Computers,
202 percent; Financial Services, 195 percent; Brokerage, 182
percent; Health Care, 180 percent; Insurance, 171 percent;
Retailing, 167 percent, and Industrial Materials, 166 percent.

FINDING A GAUGE CAN BE TRICKY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., N.J.)   (af)  
 By NOELLE KNOX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, how's your portfolio doing? Good question. The fact is that
you won't have a clue if you measure your mutual fund's performance
against the wrong benchmark. Doing so can lead to Godzilla-size
mistakes, like holding onto losers or selling winners.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong index can be easy to find. Every day, market watchers
talk about the the Dow Jones industrial average or the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, leading many to think those are the
benchmarks to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tends to compare their fund to the S&AMP;P 500, and
oftentimes that's a bad choice,'' said James R. Raker, senior
research analyst at Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in
Chicago. That is because most funds aren't trying to match or beat
those indexes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to best assess the performance of a fund like
Pennsylvania Mutual, which invests in beaten-down small-company
stocks, investors should look at the Standard &AMP; Poor's 600 Small
Cap/Barra Value index, or the Wilshire Small Cap Value index. Both
take market capitalization into account, as well as valuations.
</P>
<P>
   How to find these style- and capitalization-based indexes? On
the World Wide Web, try investorhome.com, which has links to the
sites of companies that publish various indexes, like Standard &AMP;
Poor's or Wilshire Associates.
</P>
<P>
   A key to determining the best benchmark is a little number
called R-squared, which tells you how closely a fund tracks an
index. If you have invested in funds through a brokerage firm, it
should be able to give you this number, which is between 0 and 100.
And Morningstar publishes a ``best fit'' index for funds along with
the R-squared on the Internet (www.morningstar.net). The rule of
thumb is that a fund with an R-squared of 75 or more in relation to
an index is a reasonably good fit.
</P>
<P>
   Using any index, of course, is far from perfect. Most important,
indexes don't carry the expense ratios or brokerage costs that a
fund does, so its returns are likely to be higher than a fund's.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a second kind of benchmarking: comparing a fund to
its so-called peer group of similarly managed funds. The advantage
of this link is that an investor can weigh a fund's performance
against real alternatives, not hypothetical returns. (After all, a
fund investor can't buy the S&AMP;P 500 index, only a fund that aims to
mimic it.)
</P>
<P>
   But how to choose the right peer group for your fund?
</P>
<P>
   Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J., pegs a fund to a
category _ capital appreciation, growth and income, or equity
income, for example _ based on the fund's objective as stated in
its prospectus. That seems fair enough: judging a fund by what it
says it will do.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar also groups funds by objective, but prefers to label
a fund by what is actually in its portfolio. The company determines
whether a fund's stocks are either value or growth in nature and
measures their market capitalizations. It then pegs a fund as, say,
mid-cap value, or large-cap growth, or a blend. Such a benchmark
essentially judges a fund by what it buys.
</P>
<P>
   Each system has its critics. Using a fund prospectus as a guide,
as Lipper's objectives do, has a nice official quality to it, but
fund managers often ignore what lawyers have committed to print.
And categories can be very broad.
</P>
<P>
   The Morningstar approach presents a problem, too. Fund managers
often switch from small to midsize companies, or from value to
growth stocks, based on where they see the best future returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the markets are always changing, the funds can move
from one category to another when the underlying investment
philosophy hasn't changed,'' said Susan Belden, Editor of the
No-Load Fund Analyst, an investing newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem in looking at peer groups is called
survivorship bias. Because weak funds tend to go out of business or
merge, the surviving funds tend to be the strongest performers,
which leads to a tough comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the time period you look at, the larger the
survivorship bias,'' Raker said. ``You just have to keep that in
the back of your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution to all of this is fairly simple: Use all the
benchmarks, but emphasize peer comparisons for shorter-term results
and specialized indexes for longer-term performance.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When mutual fund companies started pushing so-called lifestyle
and life-cycle funds, they seemed like sure-fire hits: single funds
that were meant to simplify the decision-making process for
befuddled investors.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, these funds would plunk an investor into a
portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds and cash tailor-made to his
investing time horizon, eliminating the need to concern himself
with complicated issues like risk or asset allocation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that investors, by and large, haven't warmed up
to the idea. Since marketing campaigns began in earnest in 1995,
lifestyle and life-cycle funds have grown to just over $10 billion
in assets, from a base of $462 million, a gain that includes market
appreciation for the 70 such funds tracked by Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the entire category is still smaller than a
single good-sized index fund _ from a marketing perspective a
pretty dismal total, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will never catch on with the kind of asset growth that a
lot of fund companies had hoped for,'' said Eli E. Neusner, a
senior consultant at Spectrem Group in San Francisco, a financial
services consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, fund watchers can chalk up at least two life-cycle
casualties. Oppenheimer Funds received shareholder approval in June
to close the Oppenheimer Lifespan series of three funds and to roll
the assets into other funds.
</P>
<P>
   And the board of directors of tiny Lifecycle Mutual Funds, which
runs four life-cycle funds with less than $10 million in assets,
plans to seek shareholder approval this summer to liquidate its
family of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Life-cycle and lifestyle funds both aim to provide one-stop
shopping for investors saving for retirement, but in different
ways. The industry often uses the names interchangeably but what
Morningstar defines as life-cycle funds are essentially dressed-up
balanced funds, created to give investors an appropriate mix of
stocks, bonds and cash for their age.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old single man, for example, might choose an
aggressive lifestyle fund that allocates more dollars to stocks
than to bonds or cash. A 55-year-old woman might want a more
conservative fund that leans more toward bonds and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle funds, which Morningstar calls target retirement
funds, emphasize the projected retirement date of the investor, so
there usually is a year in the fund's name, like Fidelity Freedom
2030. The asset mix starts aggressively and becomes more
conservative as the fund nears its target date. Fidelity Freedom
2030, for example, now has a target stock allocation of about 85
percent, while Fidelity Freedom 2010 aims for 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the idea of life-cycle and lifestyle funds is poorly
conceived. ``They are a one-size-fits-all formula that doesn't
necessarily fit everyone,'' said Alice Lowenstein, associate editor
at Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. ``Many investors would
prefer to take care of the asset allocation on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Others point to a variety of factors for the lack of popularity.
One detriment to asset growth, for example, is a mismatch between
the funds' objectives and the companies' marketing strategies. The
BT Investment Lifecycle series of funds offered by the Bankers
Trust Corp., for example, has just $314 million in assets; the
funds were started five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   John Huttlin, vice president of funds marketing, says that the
funds were designed for retirement investors, but that the firm's
401(k) business isn't nearly as strong as that of competitors like
the Vanguard Group or T. Rowe Price. ``Our asset growth has not
been as successful as other providers,'' Huttlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there is also a lack of support from brokers and
financial advisers, who normally are paid handsomely for the
asset-allocation services that life-cycle funds purport to provide
free. If a broker puts a client into one of these funds, where
assets are already allocated, the client might well ask why he or
she is paying a 5 percent load for the broker's services.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer, a unit of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Co., found that to be the case after it inherited the load-bearing
Lifespan series when Massachusetts Mutual bought Connecticut Mutual
Life Insurance Co. in 1996, said Ellen Schoenfeld, product manager
at Oppenheimer. Assets in the funds have grown to only $168.5
million from $103 million at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market has also worked against the conservative
strategies of many of these funds. BT Investment Lifecycle Long
Range, for example, had less than half its assets in stocks at the
end of May, and 40 percent in cash, according to Morningstar. And
that fund is the most aggressive of the Bankers Trust life-cycle
series.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are intended for people who are planning for
retirement, Huttlin noted. ``People are buying these funds because
they are balanced funds, and we have conservative 401(k)
participants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for lifestyle and life-cycle funds is that for
products intended to simplify investors' lives, their concept is
fairly complex for the average investor to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a confusing sale,'' said Neusner at Spectrem Group.
``It's hard enough to grasp the concept of asset allocation and
portfolio management and what constitutes an ideal portfolio. Then
if you are going to try and push lifestyle funds on them _ it's
just an issue of the message getting fuzzier.''
</P>
<P>
   Performance hasn't been a strong suit for either fund category.
Kathleen Hartman, a Morningstar analyst, looked at the asset mixes
of both lifestyle and life-cycle funds and created blended indexes
to match them against. The average life-cycle fund posted
three-year annualized returns of 17.6 percent through June 30,
versus 18.5 percent for the index.
</P>
<P>
   The average lifestyle, or target retirement, fund returned an
annualized 18.2 percent, versus 21.1 percent for the benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Not every fund family is parched for lifestyle and life-cycle
assets. The Vanguard Group has had the most success, garnering $4.6
billion in its Life Strategy series since the funds began in
September 1994. Part of this has to do with the sheer size of
Vanguard. Its phone representatives are trained to guide the
investor to the correct mix of assets for their specific needs,
said Shelton S. Unger, a principal at Vanguard. ``These funds are a
natural for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limited success, investors shouldn't expect
lifestyle or life-cycle funds to go away. Nearly every company that
is putting together a 401(k) plan or adjusting an existing plan
asks providers if they offer lifestyle funds, even if they don't
include them in the final plan, said Robert A. Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. Kemper offers the Kemper
Horizon lifestyle funds.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, Morgan Stanley Asset Management started
a series of lifestyle funds in the ``fund of funds'' category _ a
fund that invests in existing mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Hughes Guden, a principal at Morgan Stanley Asset
Management, agreed that many 401(k) plans did not adequately
explain how lifestyle funds should be used. But because all 401(k)
participants don't have personal advisers, she said, these funds
fill a niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue,'' she said, ``that there are a lot of people
who we are empowering to make an important decision that they know
little or nothing about.''

EASY LOANS TODAY, BAD LOANS TOMORROW?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mo., Ohio)   (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will today's easy-money atmosphere at American banks
lead to hard times tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, if the past is prologue. Whenever lenders go from tough
guys to E-Z Credit ``R'' Us, loan losses are almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy perking, lenders are the life of the party.
``Banks always manage for the up part of the cycle, not the whole
cycle,'' said Charles Peabody, bank analyst at Mitchell Securities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bank-stock bulls seem to think the industry is no longer
cyclical. As a result, shares are trading at historic premiums to
book value. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange bank index _ composed
of 24 of the nation's largest money center and regional banks _ is
up 16 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last twelve months, the index has gained 33 percent,
beating the 27 percent rise of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index. But a letter that the Federal Reserve Board sent to the
nation's commercial banks last month indicates that in this regard,
at least, the Fed is not ready to toss traditional standards into
history's ashcan.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, written by Richard Spillenkothen, director of
banking supervision, isn't alarmist. But because it details the
results of an extensive Fed review of bank asset quality and credit
standards, it makes surprisingly interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   In comparing loans made in 1995 with those made last year, the
Fed found that intense competition for loan customers had led to a
significant relaxation of lending standards. That hasn't resulted
in ugly problems, the Fed said, because of the robust economy _ a
caveat made more pointed by reports last week that manufacturing
activity had slowed in June for the first time in almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ugly may come sooner, not later, if some of the lending
practices identified by the Fed are commonplace. Only 20 percent to
30 percent of the several hundred loans reviewed showed any attempt
by lenders to project how a borrower might perform in an economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly half the loans, approval documents did not describe
key financial covenants _ thresholds in financial performance that
a borrower must meet _ that might trigger protective action by a
bank before a loan goes belly-up. ``Management may be inadequately
informed as to the risks'' associated with loans, the Fed wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern was the rapid growth in loans to real estate
investment trusts. Although these loans are now sound, the Fed
warned that they might represent concentrated credit risk at banks.
</P>
<P>
   Singling out REITs, Peabody said, may be a concession to Fed
members worried that rocketing real estate prices are one of the
wealth effects of an overheated stock market. He thinks a schism
may be developing inside the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   In May's Open Market Committee meeting, William Poole, president
of the St. Louis Fed, and Jerry Jordan, president of the Cleveland
bank, dissented from the decision to leave interest rates
unchanged. Arguing for a tighter monetary policy, Jordan cited
asset price inflation as a main concern.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody finds this intriguing, because schisms within the Fed
are unusual. There was a similar divergence on policy between
regional Fed banks and their Washington counterparts in 1928. The
regional members wanted to raise rates, Washington did not.
</P>
<P>
   The split made headlines in March 1929, giving a jolt to stock
prices. They recovered, but what happened later that year is, as
they say, history.

ASSEMBLY'S FAILS TO REPEAL GAS TAX ON STATE'S POWER COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Just as New York begins forcing electric power
plants to compete with each other for business, experts say that
plants in the state will be put at a disadvantage against
competitors in other states because of the state Assembly's failure
to act on a little-noticed bill in the final days of the 1998
session.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ which was supported by business groups,
environmentalists and a bipartisan group of lawmakers _ would have
repealed a New York tax on out-of-state purchases of natural gas,
the fuel used in most of the plants that supply the state's
electricity. The repeal bill passed the state Senate but never came
to a vote in the Assembly, so the tax will remain in effect at
least until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The tax is structured so that the owners of New York's power
plants usually have not had to pay it. But changes in the industry
are about to take away that protection, forcing gas-fired plants in
the state to begin paying the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the tax say it will give an advantage to power
companies in other states that want to break into New York's newly
competitive market, and to plants that burn coal, which pollute far
more than those that burn gas.
</P>
<P>
   According to legislators, lobbyists and Assembly staff members
who tracked the bill, there was no opposition to it and there were
no disagreements over wording. They say it seems to have died of
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was so frustrating to us,'' said Carol Murphy, executive
director of Independent Power Producers of New York, a lobbying
group for the state's nonutility power producers, ``because we have
a problem that's happening right now that needed to be dealt with,
and nobody was against this bill, and yet nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gov. George Pataki's broad budget vetoes in April,
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver signaled that he would not allow
passage of any bills that might be considered budget-related, but
people close to the speaker said it was not clear if that category
included the gas tax bill, or if the measure simply fell through
the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, the chief spokeswoman for Silver, said she was
not sure why the bill did not come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Legislature waits until the final days of the
session to take up hundreds of bills. Custom and legislative rules
dictate that by then, nearly everything must go through one of a
handful of committees that are tightly controlled by the leadership
of each house, before reaching the full house for a vote. Lawmakers
say it is not humanly possible for them and their staffs, in those
frenzied days, to get to each bill, and thus many are allowed to
die without a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the state has taxed natural gas purchases from other
states at 4.25 percent. The tax generates $18 million a year,
little more than a rounding error in the state's $35 billion-a-year
general fund.
</P>
<P>
   The tax law exempted the state's giant regional utilities, which
own most of the major gas-fired power plants and produce most of
the state's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But New York, like many states, is reshaping the power industry,
and one of the first steps will be to force the utilities to sell
their power plants. The first round of sales is scheduled for this
month. Once those plants are sold, their gas purchases will no
longer be exempt from the tax because they will no longer be
utility-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Independent power producers _ plant owners that do not directly
serve customers, but sell their power to the utilities _ pay the
tax. But the law provides that the utilities reimburse the
independent producers for the tax and pass the cost on to
customers.

MEDICAL `SEED' MAKERS' STOCKS CROPPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in medical equipment specialist North
American Scientific Instruments Inc. and its main competitor
plunged on concern that supply of their products will soon outweigh
demand.
</P>
<P>
   North American shares on Thursday lost a quarter of their value,
dropping $4.75 to close at $14.25. More than 346,000 shares traded
hands, or five times the issue's six-month average trading volume.
Shares in Norcross, Ga.-based Theragenics Corp. lost nearly 36
percent, closing at $14.81, on eight times its average trading
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies make implantable radioactive pellets, known as
``seeds,'' that are used as an alternative to surgery, chemotherapy
and traditional radiation therapy in treating prostate cancer.
Until recently, supply of the difficult-to-manufacture seeds has
been tight, with the companies able to sell as many pellets as they
could make.
</P>
<P>
   But with production at the companies ramping up and several new
players apparently poised to enter the market, analyst Parice
Halbert at Dain Rauscher Wessels downgraded North American on
Thursday to ``neutral'' from ``strong buy'' and downgraded
Theragenics to ``neutral'' from ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   North American shares have lost more than half their value since
hitting a six-month high of $30.50 in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Two other analysts covering North American, meanwhile, stood by
their endorsement of the company's shares and said Thursday's drop
created a buying opportunity for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Vaicek at Cruttenden Roth Inc. said the $100
million-a-year market for the seeds will likely grow to between
$300 million and $400 million in the next few years as knowledge of
the treatment, known as brachytherapy, spreads. Because there is a
backlog of orders for seeds, manufacturers have not aggressively
pursued new customers, he said. That will change once the product
becomes more plentiful, Vaicek believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of (brachytherapy) procedures will ramp up in
accordance with supply,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ryan Rauch at CIBC Oppenheimer said that because fewer
than 50 percent of oncology surgeons are currently trained to
perform brachytherapy, there are still ``huge growth cycles'' left
for the seed market as more physicians learn how to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brachytherapy is still in the initial stages,'' Rauch said.
</P>
<P>
   CIBC Oppenheimer has a ``strong buy'' rating on North American
shares while Cruttenden Roth has given the issue a ``buy'' rating.

CNN RETRACTS REPORT THAT U.S. USED NERVE GAS IN LAOS IN 1970 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add 19 grafs at end of story; subs to corrrect name of
program and to make general editing refinements throughout.)  (ps) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN AND FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable News Network executives Thursday retracted the network's
report that the U.S. military had used lethal sarin nerve gas in a
secret 1970 mission in Laos aimed at killing American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The retraction, broadcast Thursday afternoon and accompanied by
an apology, was based on an independent investigation, performed at
CNN's request, that showed the report's conclusions were not
supported by the evidence. The original broadcast, which was
accompanied by the fanfare of advance publicity common in the
growing community of broadcast news magazines, was shown June 7 as
the feature presentation on the first installment of the news
magazine show ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP;Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast, a joint venture with Time magazine that was being
hailed within the Time-Warner empire as the fruit of productive
synergy between the company's disparate news-gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The apology amounted to a devastating admission that the report
had falsely cast the U.S. government, and in particular its
military and intelligence arms, as brazenly using and concealing
the use of one of the most forbidden weapons in the modern arsenal,
a nerve gas banned by numerous international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the piece was broadcast, a slightly modified version
of the account of a mission that was code-named Operation Tailwind
was published in Time, which also made a retraction and an apology
Thursday. Journalists at Time and CNN said Thursday that the story
was broadcast and published despite reservations raised by
journalists within both organizations who received a last-minute
chance to examine the report.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive with the network confirmed Thursday that
Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and perhaps the
network's most prominent correspondent, had been reprimanded for
his work on the story.
</P>
<P>
   April Oliver and her colleague Jack Smith, the producers who had
led the eight-month reporting effort, refused to resign and were
fired. Pamela Hill, the executive producer, and who made the basic
decision to broadcast the report, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that CNN alone was responsible for the erroneous report,
CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson issued a statement Thursday
saying, ``We acknowledge serious faults in the use of sources who
provided NewsStand with the original reports and therefore retract
the Tailwind story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at Time for
this mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Time's article appeared under the bylines of Ms. Oliver, and
Arnett. A Time editor reviewed the article and accepted its basic
thrust. The report, conducted by the noted constitutional lawyer
Floyd Abrams, offered a microscopic examination of how the fabric
of journalism can unravel.
</P>
<P>
   It showed no fabrication or illegality, but a more subtle
process of distortion that began when conclusions outstripped the
evidence, continued when sources were encouraged to believe that
unseen evidence proved their own suspicions to be true and was
compounded by interviews laced with hypothetical questions and
ambiguous answers. Ultimately, the report concluded, the
journalists refused to give more than a glancing nod to a series of
eyewitnesses' denials that sarin gas was have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CNN journalists involved in this project believed in every
word they wrote,'' according to the Abrams report. ``If anything,
the serious flaws in the broadcast that we identify in this report
may stem from the depths of those beliefs and the degree to which
the journalists discounted contrary information they received
precisely because they were so firmly persuaded that what they were
broadcasting was true.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as her work was being repudiated, Ms. Oliver, the
producer, refused to back away from her conclusions. ``I feel that
this report was solid,'' said Ms. Oliver, 36, ``that I made every
step any journalist would take to ensure its accuracy and that I
had the full backing of management all the way up to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Abrams said he had
enlisted former intelligence officers from the investigative firm
of Jules Kroll to try to independently confirm the account through
their own military, intelligence and diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
   The account of the Abrams investigation, which was posted on
CNN's site on the World Wide Web (www.cnn.com), included numerous
instances of overreaching in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, his report examines the five underpinnings of
the broadcast _ including interviews with participants, information
from nerve gas experts, confidential sources with knowledge of U.S.
intelligence operations, a retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff _ and finds flaws in every one.
</P>
<P>
   The most-cited source, Admiral Thomas Moorer, who was chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from mid-1970 to mid-1974, is 87,
lives in an assisted-care retirement home in Maryland, and is no
longer relied on by CNN's military correspondents. And many of the
answers he gave were to hypothetical questions.

commando unit had attacked a base camp and then called for support
from backup airborne units, are dramatic. Particularly dramatic are
accounts that the backup fixed-wing planes dropped gas to help the
U.S. unit escape.
</P>
<P>
   But, as one of the pilots of the aircraft said Thursday, when
the CNN journalists interviewed him, ``I mostly got nerve-gas
questions and I gave tear-gas answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Art Bishop, now a retired satellite engineer, made a
brief journal entry the day after the 1970 engagement saying his
craft had been armed with cluster bomb units that carried r tear
gas and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   In his conference call, Abrams said that a separate document the
journalists relied on was ``a bad Xerox.'' It contained a virtually
illegible reference to a substance used in cluster bombs coded as
``25'' (the code for explosives). The journalist read the illegible
number as ``15,'' the code for nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the Abrams report pointed out, one member of a
reconnaissance unit on the ground near the action, Jay Graves,
``was an important on-the-ground source of information for both the
use of sarin gas and the presence of American defectors.'' The
broadcast quoted Graves as saying ``We saw some round-eyed people.
We didn't know if they were prisoners or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graves' qualifying statement _ ``I didn't see any of them''
_ was not used in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Oliver, the show's senior producer, Smith, said
Thursday that he stood by the story.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Reuters, Arnett said ``Looking at it in
retrospect, maybe I could have asked more questions about the story
than I did. But I came into it very late, after I had spent several
months covering the latest crisis in Baghdad, and by the time I got
there the direction of the story was already set.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last days before the broadcast, people in Time magazine's
New York and Washington bureaus were raising concerns about the
piece, according to several Time journalists. In particular, Mark
Thompson, the magazine's Pentagon correspondent, said he doubted
the truth of the article's allegations. ``He thought it was
unsupportable,'' said one correspondent who insisted on anonymity.
``The entire bureau was worried about it.'' Thompson was on
vacation Thursday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people at Time, Thompson and the Washington
bureau's deputy bureau chief, J.F.O. McAllister, made their
reservations known to editors in New York on June 5, the Friday
before the magazine's Monday release.
</P>
<P>
   According to one editor who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Time responded to these reservations by toning down the piece
somewhat _ putting a question mark in the headline, for example;
writing in the subhead: ``A CNN investigation charges that...''.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson, Time's managing editor, declined to elaborate on a
statement he issued Thursday, which said, ``Based on our own
investigation and that conducted by CNN, we have concluded that the
facts simply do not support the allegations that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Time article was edited by John F. Stacks, an executive
editor, and Johanna McGeary, Time's senior foreign correspondent _
both of whom did not return calls seeking comment. It was also
overseen by Joelle Attinger, an executive editor at Time Inc. who
serves as Time magazine's liaison with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' Ms. Attinger said Thursday. ``I think we
all take responsibility for it _ anybody involved in any aspect of
it must.''
</P>
<P>
   People at Time say the magazine relied on the 156-page summary
that Ms. Oliver had prepared that detailed her sources, a summary
that Abrams criticized in his report as selective and slanted.
</P>
<P>
   At no time, several people at Time said, did anyone question Ms.
Oliver's material as insufficient or suspect, nor did anyone argue
that the article should not run. Moreover, people at Time said
there was no overt pressure from CNN to publish the article.
</P>
<P>
   But one correspondent said the timing of CNN's broadcast of the
gas story _which ran that Sunday _ was such that Time felt
compelled to publish the article. ``Normally, on a Friday, if there
are serious questions about a story, you can always hold it,'' said
one Time correspondent who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time has been working with CNN on polls and on the news
magazine program ``Impact,'' the gas story was the magazine's first
collaboration in the magazine. Despite its potentially damaging
results, Isaacson said in his statement that Time looks forward
``to continuing to collaborate'' with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc.
said the company stood by its alliance with CNN. ``It doesn't cause
me to rethink the teamwork with TV,'' he said. ``All of us
obviously learned some things here and I'm sure as the weeks go on
we'll have discussions about what are the appropriate procedures in
any kind of joint venture.''

STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE UPHOLDS CRACKDOWN ON TAXIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan upheld the
Giuliani administration's crackdown on the taxi and livery industry
Thursday, including steeply increased insurance requirements for
owners and harsher penalties for drivers who commit violations.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Franklin Weissberg ruled that while the Taxi and
Limousine Commission had violated the state's open meetings law by
holding a closed-door caucus before approving 15 new safety rules
on May 28, the violation was not serious enough to warrant throwing
out the commission's votes.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg did overturn one rule requiring owners of cab
medallions to file financial disclosure forms, noting that the
commission already had that information.
</P>
<P>
   The two industry groups that had challenged the rules in court _
the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents fleet
owners, and the New York City Committee for Taxi Safety, made up of
medallion brokers _ said they had no plans to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, David Beier, a lawyer for the Committee for Taxi
Safety, said his group hoped to work with the taxi commission to
modify some of the rules. After the ruling, the group released a
proposal for increasing insurance that Beier said gave riders
better protection than the mayor's proposals, but at a much lower
cost for owners.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg's ruling surprised the industry groups, which had been
encouraged last week when he criticized the commission for
apparently violating the open meetings law, which is intended to
make sure public bodies conduct their business in public. He had
asked, rhetorically, what harm would be done if the votes were
taken again, in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the purpose of finding a violation of the law if it
doesn't invalidate what's done improperly?'' Beier asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Weissberg ruled that although the open meetings law had been
violated, the ``draconian measure'' of annulling the commission's
votes was unjustified, because the secrecy of the meeting had not
significantly affected those votes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commissioners had given fair consideration to the
industry's views by postponing voting on two rules that attracted
the most heated criticism in the daylong public hearing preceding
the vote, and by modifying several other rules.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did, however, order the city to pay the fees of the
taxi groups' lawyers as punishment for violating the open meetings
law.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the ruling ``a
great victory for all New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the 14 rules are to go into effect on July 26. The
insurance requirement, which many owners said was so expensive it
would put them out of business, is to go into effect on Aug. 26, to
give the industry time to propose alternative plans.
</P>
<P>
   As passed, the rule requires taxis and livery cabs to increase
the insurance that compensates victims for pain and suffering to
$100,000 from $25,000, and the insurance that covers medical bills
and lost wages to $200,000, up from $50,000 or $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposed rule, voting on which was postponed under heavy
pressure from the industry, requires yellow-cab owners to post an
additional $100,000 bond for accident victims to collect.

HOME IN CHILD SEX ABUSE CASE WAS DEEMED SAFE BY AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six months before police arrested Daniel Robacker and
Theresa Fremgen on charges of repeatedly raping their two daughters
in a filthy Brooklyn apartment, child welfare officials approved
the home as a safe place for the teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are home with their parents,'' said Esther Simon, a
lawyer for the Administration for Children's Services, as she
recommended during a court hearing in January that the sisters not
be sent back to foster care. ``They are doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though a city caseworker was assigned to see the girls
twice a month, and a city housekeeper was assigned to clean the
Bushwick apartment each weekday, neither saw signs of the sexual
abuse that occurred routinely, police say. Robacker, Ms. Fremgen,
her ex-boyfriend and her two brothers are accused of raping and
sodomizing their own children and young relatives in apartment 2E
of 232 Linden St.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the abuse, which emerged Thursday as
investigators released snippets of statements made by each suspect,
painted a horrifying portrait of a home where two sisters were
raped amid squalor and stuffed animals along with an 8-year-old
boy, who was a friend of the family, while the household was under
the city's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The five adults, some of whom are mildly mentally retarded or
illiterate, spoke openly to police about the rape and incest that
took place, investigators say. In a graphic but neatly written
statement to police, one of the suspects, Ezra Fremgen, described
the little boy as a willing accomplice and wrote of the assaults
matter-of-factly: ``We had sex every Saturday that his father
brought him by.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Administration for Children's Services, which
is investigating the case, declined to say whether the caseworker
made all the visits required by law. And even if she had, it was
unclear whether the worker would have detected signs of the sexual
abuse, which is notoriously difficult to spot, especially when it
is a closely guarded secret among the children. Police said the
children kept silent about the abuse for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   But new information in the case raised disturbing questions
about whether the city had adequately assessed the safety of the
children. The 14-year-old girl and the 8-year-old boy each had more
than 18 absences from school this year, school officials said,
often an indicator of trouble at home. Child welfare officials
declined to comment on whether they had ever looked into the
absences.
</P>
<P>
   And child welfare records indicate that Ms. Fremgen, 35, was
abused or neglected when she was a teen-ager. Helen Robacker, her
aunt, said Ms. Fremgen was raped by a relative when she was 15.
Caseworkers are required to seek out such information about the
parents they monitor, because all too often it increases the risk
of abuse to children living in the household, according to city
records.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the psychological evaluations of Ms. Fremgen, which
were conducted by the city in 1994 and by an agency contracted by
the city in 1997, mention or assess the severity or impact of any
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Stancik, the special investigator for the city schools,
said that his office was poring over the children's attendance
records and was working with the Brooklyn district attorney's
office. And officials at the Administration for Children's Services
declined to comment about the other issues, saying they wanted to
complete their inquiry first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matter is under investigation,'' said Leonora Wiener, an
ACS spokeswoman. ``We'll have no further comment until our
investigation is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   As the officials searched for answers to the many troubling
questions, a bleak picture was developing of the suspects, whose
lives were marked by poverty, mental illness and, sometimes,
neglectful behavior toward children, according to court records and
psychological evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Framgen, 35, is mentally retarded, according to a
psychological evaluation. Robacker, 40, her companion and first
cousin, dropped out of school in the fourth grade. And Curtis
James, the father of the 8-year-old boy, lived on the streets and
had trouble reading a newspaper, even though he completed trade
school, the court records show.
</P>
<P>
   All five adults were arraigned Thursday in Brooklyn Criminal
Court on a total of 82 counts of rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, incest
and endangering the welfare of a child. Included among the suspects
were Vincent and Ezra Fremgen, the brothers of Ms. Fremgen.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who had said on Wednesday that four children had been
abused, said Thursday it appeared there were only three victims.
</P>
<P>
   They said that two sisters, age 13 and 14, were victimized by
their parents, their uncles and a close family friend who lived
with them. The 8-year-old boy was victimized by his father and by
one of the uncles.
</P>
<P>
   All the sexual offenses took place in the same place: Apartment
2E of 232 Linden St. in Bushwick, Brooklyn, a cluttered, filthy
apartment with stacks of trinkets, clothes, garbage and, in the
bedrooms, pornography.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators believe that the sexual abuse went on for
years, the charges cover numerous sexual offenses that prosecutors
say took place between April 1 and June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The case unraveled when the 8-year-old boy told his new foster
mother that he had been sodomized by Ezra Fremgen. Police arrested
Fremgen on June 30, and he admitted he had sexually abused and
sodomized the boy. Police arrested the others the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements indicate that most knew what was going on and
on occasion they observed each other,'' said a law enforcement
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``They appear to
be very low-functioning people. It doesn't appear that they tried
to hide it.''

LAWYER IN BRAWLEY TRIAL INSISTS THE PLAINTIFF IS GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Steven Pagones, the plaintiff in the Tawana
Brawley defamation case, is ``lucky he is not in jail'' for the
rape and kidnapping of Miss Brawley a decade ago, one of the
defense lawyers said in his summation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jackson, the lawyer for C. Vernon Mason, told the jurors
that Pagones was a well-connected man who had manipulated the
system for a decade to avoid answering charges. Contrary to a grand
jury report that exonerated Pagones and discredited Miss Brawley's
account, Jackson said it was clear that Miss Brawley had been
sexually assaulted in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is astonishing that in this day and age, people can still
get away with things like that,'' Jackson said. ``And what is more
incredible is that he actually sued. He's lucky he is not in jail.
Don't let him get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the jurors to challenge what he called the ``ego,
arrogance, racism'' behind the suit by Pagones, who is white,
against the three Brawley advisers, Mason, Alton Maddox and the
Rev. Al Sharpton, who, like Miss Brawley, are black.
</P>
<P>
   While Sharpton's lawyer, Michael Hardy, used his closing
statement on Wednesday to focus on the constitutional protections
for civil rights advocates, Jackson took a sharply different tack
Thursday. He essentially stitched together the hints, fragments of
evidence and implications that suggested to supporters of Miss
Brawley that Pagones had been involved in an assault. The defense
lawyer urged the jurors to ``correct history'' and vindicate Miss
Brawley by rejecting Pagones' claim of defamation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's recitation of the facts that he said implicated
Pagones amounted to a repeat of familiar accusations: a postal
worker saw a suspicious car filled with white men near the place
where Miss Brawley was discovered; Pagones hired a lawyer before
the advisers ever named him as a suspect, and medical attendants at
first described Miss Brawley as unconscious and unresponsive.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade before the trial began and for nearly eight months
in the courtroom, such facts have been examined so many times by
each side that they have lost the power to surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's five-hour statement by Jackson contained many
conspiratorial asides. ``Very suspicious and very curious,'' he
said. ``Something to hide.'' Nods of approval from his supporters
and cold stares from supporters of Pagones suggested, though, that
most minds had long since been made up.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs in the courtroom, however, that as the case
builds toward a conclusion, both sides were preparing for the
inevitable continuing battle after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones' mother and wife, who have avoided appearing at the
trial, have begun attending, as if to shore up his camp.
</P>
<P>
   But the advisers have had unusual visitors, too, in recent days.
Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president, and Calvin
Butts, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, have
made appearances, making comments that suggested support for the
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors remain impossible to read, though they seemed deeply
engaged in their task. As Thursday's proceedings ended, someone
produced a birthday cake at the defense table for Hardy, Sharpton's
lawyer, who turned 43 Thursday. As the jurors filed out, some of
them could be seen joining the advisers' supporters in singing
``Happy Birthday.''

NEW EXPERIENCE FOR HERSHISER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It will have the appearance of the most vile
heresy: Orel Hershiser, standing on the mound in San Francisco,
wearing the uniform of the loathsome Giants, pitching against the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Brace for it tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker juggled his rotation over the past
week and Hershiser, who signed with the club last winter, just
happened to pop up with the starting assignment for the first
meeting of the season between the entrenched rivals. Baker insists
several on-field factors, not sentiment, influenced his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Still...
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, once the embodiment of Los Angeles Dodgers excellence
and dignity, facing L.A. as a member of !ital!that!off! team? Is
nothing sacred?
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Dodgers, however, might weigh this event against the
tumult of the last two months and say, ``Well, no, apparently
nothing is.''
</P>
<P>
   This, certainly, is the perspective of Hershiser, who became a
baseball pragmatist 3{ years ago when the Dodgers said they no
longer had work for him. When surveying the dismantling of
tradition that has occurred on the Dodgers in the wake of their
purchase by the Fox Group, Hershiser said of his gut reaction,
``It's a grieving: The old neighborhood is gone. The neighborhood's
been knocked down, they're putting up condos.''
</P>
<P>
   But then his baseball business sense, deeply ingrained since his
departure from the club, kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right for me to start evaluating Fox,'' he
said. ``You have a changing of the guard in ownership, so I think
all the rules are off _ what's the employment tradition here,
what's the tradition with the uniforms, what's the tradition at the
ballpark, all those different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Fox is going to create its own new tradition, just
like Disney is creating its tradition (with the Angels). I have no
problem with what's going on at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ice cream, it's baseball. It's like somebody removed
vanilla ice cream from the menu. I can't still have vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easier, then, to take Hershiser at his word when he
insists he will experience not one pang of incongruity when he
winds up to deliver the first sinkerball tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of it as some big sentimental road I'm supposed
to journey down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be odd to face a lineup of Steve Sax leading off,
Mickey Hatcher batting second _ go right down the line with guys I
played with and had relationships with. But this is just a team,
it's just a uniform. It's not the same. I don't see the uniform, I
see the person.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants went looking for a starting pitcher last winter,
they primarily saw rock-steady consistency in Hershiser, even as he
pushed age 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know what kind of person he was,'' said Giants
pitching coach Ron Perranoski, another Dodgers expatriate.
``Playing against him, you look at him, you think he's cocky. But
they didn't know the true person he is _ a tremendous human being.
They learned that right away this spring. He's been a great help
with the young pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been good with the older guys, too,'' countered Baker,
still another former Dodger. ``He's a joker and a prankster _ which
I wouldn't have expected _ and a part-time referee. He brings a lot
to the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of performance, Hershiser has been streaky with the
Giants _ undoubtedly a maddening condition for the team's fans, who
might not have been eager to embrace him.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser said he got 10-to-15 poison-pen letters a month early
in the season, as he staggered from the gate with a record of 0-3.
Then came a vintage stretch of work _ a 10-year-old vintage, to be
precise: six victories in a row, with only six earned runs allowed
over a span of 48 innings. At the end of May, Hershiser became the
oldest player in baseball history to be named pitcher of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, he has struggled, losing his past three
decisions. He'll enter his Dodgers start with a 6-6 record, coupled
with the customarily solid ERA of 3.84.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago. That's when the separation occurred, against
Hershiser's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the '94 season, he was coming off a rough
three-year period that corresponded to his recovery from shoulder
surgery, and the Dodgers considered him expendable. It was
understandable rationale, since the club was flush with promising
young pitchers _ Ismael Valdes, Chan Ho Park, Pedro Astacio, Darren
Dreifort _ with Hideo Nomo destined to arrive within three months.
</P>
<P>
   But after switching leagues to sign with Cleveland, Hershiser
demonstrated that there was plenty of life in his arm _ and in a
body he has always kept in the picture of fitness. Over three
seasons with the Indians, he averaged 15 victories per year and put
up a winning percentage of .682.
</P>
<P>
   Currently ranked fifth among active pitchers in victories with
185, Hershiser says he hopes to climb above 200 before considering
retirement. He's in no hurry to call an end to any of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey is so much more fun than the results,'' Hershiser
said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what colors he wears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in spring training after I first became a Giant,''
Hershiser said, ``people asked me, `Isn't it odd putting on this
uniform?' I said no. I look around the room, I'm not dressing next
to Matt (Williams), Robby T. (Thompson), Jeff Leonard, Kevin
Mitchell, Will Clark. My pitching staff is not everybody in the
world who throws a split-finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Dusty Baker and Ron Perranoski and a bunch of guys I
know who happen to wear a Giants uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation is here. It's not my generation.''
</P>
<P>
   And those aren't his Dodgers.

<P>
   TOKYO _ The government announced a long-awaited plan Thursday to
clear away the nation's pile of bad debt in hopes of bolstering
global confidence in Japan and setting the world's second largest
economy on track for growth.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Total Plan,'' which still needs to be approved by
Parliament, amounts to a program for dealing with at least $550
billion in problem &UR;  &LR; loans held by Japan's largest banks. The
centerpiece is a mechanism to allow banks to fail without provoking
chaos in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The government would shut down insolvent institutions and turn
over their clients to government-run ``bridge banks'' to keep the
credit flowing. It would also accelerate sales of depressed real
estate held as collateral for bad loans. Shaky companies would
close, thousands of people could be put out of work, and bankers
could be prosecuted for financial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Hikaru Matsunaga, the finance minister, announced that the
government was embracing the plan, shortly after it was approved
Thursday by a task force. Markets reacted cautiously to the
announcement, which had been widely anticipated, while foreign
governments urged that it be followed up with strong measures to
put it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   There has been growing apprehension that the Japanese banking
crisis is now at the heart of Asia's financial problems and may
also threaten the economies in the West and the long boom on Wall
Street. And President Clinton and other American officials have
been stepping up the pressure lately on the Japanese. In
Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a statement
that the plan contained ``potentially significant steps,'' but he
stressed that ``what is important is for the Japanese authorities
to move quickly to translate this approach into concrete actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, analysts warned that because the plan would bring
about a great deal of pain, Japan's leaders faced enormous
obstacles in carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a great deal of will to clean the bad debt out
of the private sector, and I think the politicians are committed to
that, but I'm not sure the politicians are willing to restructure
the financial sector and restructure the economy,'' said John
Neuffer, a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute in
Tokyo. ``They are wonderful when it comes to passing around the
pork, but much less willing to pass around the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks, which has soared over
the last seven days on expectations of the plan and in anticipation
of tax cuts, rose again Thursday, though it lost some of its gains
in the afternoon as details of the plan were reported. The Nikkei
finished up 108.69 points, or sixth-tenths of a percent, at
16,471.58.
</P>
<P>
   But currency markets showed hesitancy, weakening the yen to
140.34 to the dollar from 139.17 in early London trading, just as
Matsunaga, the finance minister, was outlining the plan.
</P>
<P>
   (In trading Friday morning in Tokyo, the Nikkei was down
modestly, and the yen was steady against the dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   An outline of the plan, which is expected to be approved by
Parliament in late July or early August, was disclosed by Matsunaga
and other officials. They insisted that Japan would move toward a
market-based economy and pull away from the convoy system in which
all the banks support one another and move ahead only as quickly as
the slowest bank. Masaharu Hino, head of the new Financial
Supervision Agency, suggested that the government would allow more
banks to fail. He said the agency would take ``strict measures''
after it inspected the nation's 19 largest banks over the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will recover confidence in the Japanese financial system by
severing ties with the past convoy administration and shifting to
an administration of severe policing, based on clear rules,'' Hino
said. ``That is the main road toward the rebirth of the financial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy has been languishing ever since the speculative
economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, sending property prices
crashing and bad loans soaring. For nearly eight years, both the
government and the banks have been sitting tight in the hopes that
the real estate market would recover and their problems disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Though the banks have been nibbling away at their bad debts, the
problems have worsened with the recession. The government has let a
few banks fail in a controlled, ad hoc fashion, and it has set
aside $214 billion to protect depositors and bolster the capital
strength of the banks. But it has been loath to take drastic
measures to solve the problem _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, officials used the English words ``Total Plan'' to
describe the new measure Thursday, perhaps because they sound
bolder and more innovative than the equivalent Japanese terms. The
effort appears to be modeled on the U.S. cleanup of the
savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The plan tries to tear off bad debt from the banks through
foreclosures on properties held as collateral and by encouraging
the revival of the real estate market. It also aims to bring about
a more open financial system by increasing disclosure in a
traditionally secretive banking community, and to impose greater
rigor in the system by stepping up inspection standards and
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Insolvent banks will be allowed to fail, using a two-stage
bridge bank. The plan will first put collapsed banks under
government administration, protecting creditworthy borrowers left
in the lurch by the failed bank, while a merger partner is sought.
Then the collapsed bank will either be acquired or, if no buyers
emerge, nationalized with public money, sending the bad debts to an
agency established to collect bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the bridge bank approach is that it insures
that corporate customers of a failed bank will continue to have
access to loans, reducing the shock of a bank failure. The
disadvantage is that it raises questions about whether Japan, which
has overcapacity in its financial system, is truly willing to let
banks fail and whether the bridge bank system is simply one more
way of allowing insolvent institutions to founder a bit longer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Initially, public money will be drawn from the 30 trillion yen,
or $214 billion, bailout fund set up in March at Deposit Insurance
Corp., which will set up the bridge banks as subsidiaries of a new
holding company. The corporation will then try to transfer the
business to a healthy bank within two years, though that could be
extended to five years. The total cost of the bailout is by no
means clear.
</P>
<P>
   One sticky point is how the distinction between good and bad
borrowers will be made and whether bad borrowers will be rescued
along with the good ones. Naturally, any client of a failed bank
will insist that it is a good borrower and should continue to
receive loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is designing a mechanism that appears similar to the
former Resolution Trust Corp. in the United States, which disposed
of bad debts during the savings-and-loan crisis in the 1980s. In
Japan, the Financial Supervisory Agency, which last month split off
about 400 people from the Finance Ministry to inspect the banks,
will be given wide authority to direct the process.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the blueprint, however, say the Total Plan does not
address some of the fundamental rigidities of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Total Plan at all,'' said Chiaki Nishiyama, an
economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who is
now in Tokyo. ``It's a very deceiving term.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plan purges the banks of their bad loans, many
economists feel that a broad restructuring and deregulation of
industry are still necessary to bring about a strong economic
revival. One difference between the American experience and Japan's
situation is that the United States embarked on the painful
reworking of the savings-and-loans industry just as the economy was
picking up. In contrast, Japan is beginning its plan as it sinks
into a recession, and it is already spending $120 billion in fiscal
expansion to bolster economic output.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might get a mild recovery out of this, but it will not be
impressive,'' said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities
Japan. ``If there's a promise of a deregulatory effort, they can
use fiscal expansion as a down payment. But a fiscal down payment
by itself, without restructuring, is a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, however, are a little bit more hopeful.
Resolving the bad debt is the first step toward improving the
economy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we have to solve the confidence crisis, and solving the
bad loans is a starting point,'' said Heizo Takenaka, an economics
professor at Keio University. Then, he added, Japan can ``promote a
deregulated, more transparent open-market system.''

2 KIOSKS TO BRING CAFE CULTURE TO CENTRAL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ever-expanding coffee-and-pastry-shop universe
reached Central Park this week with the construction of two lacy,
cast-iron food kiosks under the trees inside the park's Columbus
Circle entrance.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics worried that the kiosks marked the further
commercialization of Manhattan's most public of spaces, Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern said they would be a welcome amenity, one
that may even be repeated at other park entrances if they prove
successful. The stands are to be run by Ferrara, a 106-year-old
restaurant whose original establishment is at 195 Grand St. between
Mott and Mulberry Streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a beautiful, Italian-style sidewalk kiosk at
Columbus Circle is one of the most inviting and elegant things I
can imagine,'' Stern said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Park kiosks are to open in mid-July. Breakfast,
lunch and light dinners will be served seven days a week in warmer
months, along with the more traditional Ferrara fare of coffee,
cakes, pastries and ice cream. There will be tables and chairs for
20 patrons around each structure.
</P>
<P>
   The one-story kiosks _ painted a glistening dark green and
abundantly ornamented with delicate details _ stand on either side
of the Maine Monument, within the Merchants' Gate, the recently
restored southwest entrance to Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first entirely new structures to be constructed in
the park since 1993, when the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center was
built on the Harlem Meer, near Central Park North and Lenox Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Though they look as though they might date from the Victorian
era, the kiosks were assembled in the last few days from parts made
in Italy and shipped to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because they went up so quickly, their presence took some civic
organizations by surprise. For example, neither the Parks Council,
a nonprofit advocacy group, nor Landmarks West, an Upper West Side
preservation group, knew about the construction until they were
reached Thursday by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cooke, executive director of the Parks Council, said
the organization was ``not opposed to a concession that enhances a
parkgoer's use and enjoyment of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are concerned that there's been a systematic, continued
de-funding of parks,'' she said, ``and a steady, growing dependence
on private sources of income, whether earned or donated, to replace
lost tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Landmark West president Arlene Simon went further in her
criticism. ``When you go into the park, there needs to be some
relief,'' she said. ``You're NOT on Columbus Avenue. Having
Ferrara's tables and chairs _ that's not what we have those 800
acres for.''
</P>
<P>
   A public-versus-private tug-of-war has gone on for decades over
Central Park, where many services and amenities are provided by
concessionaires. A debate erupted in 1996 over a proposal to
install information posts around the park whose corporate sponsors
would be credited in two-inch-tall letters on the structures _ akin
to advertising, opponents said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in March, the Parks Department was criticized for
renting Sheep Meadow to Walt Disney Co. for the filming of a
commercial, at a time of year when the meadow was closed to regular
use by the public.

BACK ON THE OFFENSIVE FOR CITY CHARTER GURU 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eight years ago, Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr. took his
celebrated family name and several shelves of civic accomplishments
and quietly departed from New York City's public arena. He had just
led the commission that rewrote the City Charter, and _ unlike his
old boss, Mayor Ed Koch _ found it unnecessary to comment on how it
was carried out or offer his momentary opinions on Koch's two
successors.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters would seek comments about the Dinkins or Giuliani
administrations, and he would politely beg off. Elected officials
would try to enlist him in their temporal disputes, hoping his
interpretation of the charter would bolster theirs, and he would
say the thing spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, like many New Yorkers, he was deeply ambivalent about
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, delighted at the mayor's success in
reducing crime but worried about the reasons the administration was
loath to release information about city government. But until this
week, he held his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, with the release of a blistering letter on Monday,
Schwarz has roared back into public life, furious over the mayor's
decision to try rewriting the charter to block a referendum on
moving Yankee Stadium to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Writing to Peter Powers, the former first deputy mayor and
chairman of Giuliani's hastily formed Charter Revision Commission,
he said the attempt to rewrite the charter to the advantage of the
mayoralty was a ``trivialization and politicalization of charter
revision'' and represented ``awful government.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in and around City Hall reacted as if a stone colossus had
come back to life and was rumbling menacingly in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   Powers declined to discuss the substance of the seven-page
letter and criticized Schwarz for not informing him of it in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   One anonymous official was quoted in The New York Times as
saying that Schwarz, a Democrat, was acting politically. Paul
Crotty, like Schwarz a former city corporation counsel and a member
of Giuliani's panel, said his predecessor was simply trying to
protect his handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very proud of the charter,'' said Crotty, now a group
president with Bell Atlantic. ``It represents for him a careful
balancing of interests, and he doesn't want it changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, whose family sold the eponymous toy store in the 1960s,
has a courtly manner born of prominence and does not have to
struggle to restrain himself at such suggestions. He said that his
political involvement had been minimal (though he did give the
maximum of $7,700 to Ruth Messinger's mayoral campaign), and that
he had no problem with changes to the charter, as long as they were
undertaken thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fairly consider these issues without an extensive
public process because charter commissions are not elected
bodies,'' he said in his 40th-floor law office at the lofty firm of
Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore, where he has been a partner on and off
since 1969. ``If you haven't had a very extensive and open process,
you're dealing with a blunt instrument in referenda that can be
manipulated by money. And that makes the process incredibly
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, it seems fair to say, has a passion for process _
checks, balances, the visibly operating mechanism of government _
as a protector of the public good. Having given New York City
mayors broader powers than the president or the governor to spend
money and make policy, his commission also included several
countervailing forces to watch over that power, the various
monitors under which Giuliani chafes and has proposed changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the nature of powerful people in executive jobs,''
he said, insisting he was not referring specifically to the present
mayor. ``With a few exceptions, they feel they can get it done, so
they say, `Why should I face criticism or second-guessing or new
ideas?' And the great lesson of America is that we don't trust one
individual to have so much power.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though he has often represented some of the country's largest
corporations at Cravath, Schwarz, known as Fritz to a wide group of
friends, has an even longer streak of anti-authoritarianism, which
he said he absorbed from the Kennedy era of vigorous civic
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard Law School in 1960, he led a protest against the
local Woolworth's when black students were holding a famous sit-in
at the Woolworth's in Greensboro, N.C. He spent a year in Nigeria
helping apply its new constitution after years of colonialism, and
he was chief counsel to Sen. Frank Church's intelligence committee
in 1975, investigating the FBI and the CIA. He has worked with many
local civic and charitable groups, and even those who disagree with
him on the current matter are aware that it is difficult to assail
him.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, whose boyishly flyaway hair makes it hard to believe he
is 63 with three children in their 30s, is the great-grandson of
Frederick August Otto Schwarz, who founded the store in 1862. His
family's only remaining connection to the store is a license fee
the current owners pay for the name, which goes to a charitable
foundation for children. But as with city government, he feels
obligated to drop by now and then to make sure things are running
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a grandchild now,'' he said. ``I want to make sure
it's still a quality store.''

EDITORIAL: THE CNN-TIME RETRACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   The pre-launch publicity for a new Time-CNN collaboration called
``NewsStand'' made its first piece sound like the daring
international scoop of every journalist's dreams. But on Thursday,
less than a month after CNN and Time jointly charged that America
secretly used nerve gas on a mission designed to kill defectors
during the Vietnam War, they took it back.
</P>
<P>
   In a 54-page analysis of the reporting for the two news
organizations, the First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams concluded
that the charge was ``insupportable.'' CNN, Time and their parent
company, Time Warner, released the devastating Abrams report and
began trying to explain, in a very public way, what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, this was a story that was pushed far beyond its limits.
Hazy quotes from an 86-year-old former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, Adm. Thomas Moorer, that did not support the piece;
barracks gossip and unreliable reconstituted memories all were
stretched into a dramatic but unproven charge.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at transcriptions of notes and interviews, Abrams said
it was clear that investigators at CNN fervently believed, and
probably still believe, that their story is correct. But as the
report points out, they did not have enough evidence to make such
explosive charges. Most important, they were so intent on proving
their case, they did not listen closely enough to the many sources
who insisted that their premise was not true.
</P>
<P>
   It is an old problem in journalism, and many question how the
professionals at CNN and Time let it resurface for such an
important piece. In the case of CNN, which did the bulk of the
reporting, three top investigators announced they were leaving the
company. Time magazine, which published CNN's article without
running it through its own reporting and editing system, lost
editorial control, a bad idea made even worse by the sensitivity
and magnitude of this flawed revelation. Finally, there is an
underlying question about whether these two media organizations
were driving too hard to make a splash in today's saturated market,
a frenzy that perhaps led to cutting corners and hyping the piece.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this has been a season for media embarrassments.
The Boston Globe, owned by The New York Times Co., recently
dismissed a columnist after editors learned she had been inventing
people and eloquent quotes. The New Republic dismissed a reporter
who fabricated a political underworld that seemed, and was, too
outrageous to be true. And The Cincinnati Enquirer this week paid
Chiquita International Brands an astonishing $10 million, retracted
a series about the fruit company and dismissed the reporter in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   For all these organizations, the damage will linger for some
time. For CNN and Time, it will undoubtedly inject a healthy note
of caution into future collaborations. But in each case, the
journalists had the right instinct to declare error openly and
quickly. That is the media's road to restoring credibility after
making such grave mistakes.

MAYOR PROMOTES BUDGET DIRECTOR TO DEPUTY MAYOR FOR OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Thursday promoted his
budget director, Joseph Lhota, to deputy mayor for operations, the
position that has traditionally been second in command at City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota succeeded Randy Mastro, who resigned Monday to return to
private law practice.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Lhota, a central player in the recent budget
skirmishes with the City Council, is not likely to push the
Giuliani administration in any major new direction.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy mayor for operations is responsible for the
day-to-day management of government, negotiating the city budget
and making deals with council leaders. As the mayor's most trusted
aide and a sort of alter ego, he fights for the his causes in
televised debates and hammers at issues with reporters inside his
office at City Hall's western end.
</P>
<P>
   The predecessors to Lhota in the job were Mastro, a registered
Democrat who was a protege from Giuliani's days as a federal
prosecutor, and Peter Powers, a lifelong friend of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to carry out the goals of the mayor and his
strategic objectives,'' said Lhota, who like Giuliani is a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more immediate thoughts on Lhota's mind Thursday was
what shade to repaint his new office. The deputy mayor for
operations is the only one of the four deputy mayors to have an
office in the City Hall building.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Lhota would inherit all the
responsibilities held by Mastro or whether some might be given to
other members of Giuliani's inner circle, which includes Randy
Levine, deputy mayor for economic development; Dennison Young Jr.,
the chief counsel; Anthony Coles, a senior adviser, and Cristyne
Lategano, the communications director. Giuliani gave no hint
Thursday of how power might be divided, saying only, ``I will leave
it up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not name a successor to Lhota on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the administration in 1994, Lhota, 43, worked for
several years as an investment banker specializing in municipal
finance. He was born on City Island in the Bronx, and his father
was a New York City police lieutenant.

FRANCE'S ZIDANE TO RETURN AGAINST ITALY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Nobody heads into today's World Cup
showdown at the Stade de France with greater anticipation than
Zinedine Zidane, the great French playmaker who received a red card
and was forced to watch his team's past two games from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how stressful it is being on the bench,'' he
said in advance of today's quarterfinal showdown with Italy. ``You
see the guys fighting and you're just a supporter. There's nothing
you can do to help them out.''
</P>
<P>
   His nerves were frayed after France's last match, a sudden-death
triumph over Paraguay that, if not for Laurent Blanc's 114th-minute
goal, could have been the end of the host's Cup hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been awful,'' said the midfielder, who has
emerged in the past two years as the world's No.1 playmaker. ``To
lose when you're playing is bad enough, but at least you can say
that you did your best. It's much worse when you don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Zidane, a Marseille-born offspring of Algerian immigrants, was
forced to the sidelines after impetuously stomping on an opponent
during a 4-0 rout of Saudi Arabia, an action that left him ``angry
at myself... I know I should not have responded to provocation.''
</P>

   It left him depressed and his teammates did what they could to
lift his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days before the Paraguay match, he felt awful,''
said Philippe Bergeroo, France's assistant trainer. ``You know
Zizou, he hardly ever talks and it's hard to know how he feels. But
you could see he was going through a nightmare. If France had gone
out, he would have felt responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to make sure the French, facing their toughest test
of the Cup, reach the Final Four. His influence on whether that
occurs will be immense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know how important Zizou is,'' captain Didier Deschamps
said. ``Our attacking game depends almost entirely on him.''

WORLD BANK, A BIT NERVOUS, RESUMES AID TO INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Bank resumed aid to Indonesia Thursday
for the first time since President Suharto was forced from office.
It approved a $1 billion loan and predicted that major industrial
nations would soon announce another $6 billion in aid.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion loan was part of a $4.5 billion contribution from
the World Bank that was promised earlier this year, before the
rioting and political upheaval that brought down Suharto after 32
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   But the loan comes at a time when international aid officials
describe the country as standing on the edge of an economic abyss:
Its economy is shrinking faster than anyone expected, its
unemployment rate is soaring and its currency is unable to recover
from a steep fall in value.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Thursday's loan is enormously risky, and World Bank
officials worry that they may not be able to control how it is
spent. They are making only $600 million available immediately; the
rest will come later this year, if Indonesia meets a number of the
economic commitments it has made since Suharto's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this loan as a critical component in the overall
package of assistance provided by the international community,''
James Wolfensohn, the World Bank's president, said in a statement.
``Its objective is to rebuild confidence and help Indonesia make a
new start.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion is for reform of the financial and banking
systems, and to pay for imports of food and other commodities.
Rampant inflation, expected to reach 80 percent this year, has set
off much of the social unrest in Indonesia, including attacks on
the ethnic Chinese minority, which dominates much of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago the International Monetary Fund announced it had
reached a new accord with Indonesia _ its fourth since October _
that would enable the fund to resume its aid this month, too. Its
disbursements were halted in May, as the rioting worsened.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord allows for more social spending, and permits
Indonesia to run a significant budget deficit, something the
earlier agreements prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF said last week that the total aid package to Indonesia,
about $43 billion, would not be sufficient. It appealed to other
countries to come up with another $6 billion to help Indonesia
subsidize critical commodities, including food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident that that package will come,'' Dennis de
Tray, the bank's director for Indonesia, said Thursday. He added
that the additional aid would take ``weeks, but not many,'' to put
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a time to hold back and wait and see,'' de Tray
said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the United States, which has the largest
vote in the World Bank, supported Thursday's decision. It was the
first official vote of confidence in the new government of
President B.J. Habibie, a longtime friend of Suharto's.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans who have dealt with Habibie and his new Cabinet
have come away with mixed impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Several encounters with the president have apparently gone in
surprising directions, with Habibie expounding on unusual economic
theories or regaling visitors with accounts of his efforts to build
a national airplane for Indonesia, a program that the fund halted.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand the finance minister, Ginandjar Kartasmita, is
gaining increasing respect in Washington. He appears serious about
wide-ranging economic reforms, officials say, and he is coming to
Washington next week to seek more aid.

11 FIREFIGHTERS ARE FINED FOR FRACAS AT PARK CAFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A month after accounts of a drunken brawl among
firefighters at a midtown restaurant, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von
Essen penalized 11 firemen Thursday with a loss of pay for their
involvement, and closed an investigation into what he called ``a
very sad day in the history of our department.''
</P>
<P>
   While witnesses had initially told of scores of firefighters
battling one another, urinating publicly and harassing patrons in
scenes of chaos that went on for hours at the Bryant Park Grill on
the night of June 3, Von Essen said that his investigators had
found only two who ``were involved in physical altercations'' and
eight who had ``contributed to an embarrassing display.''
</P>
<P>
   The two said to have been involved in fighting, Francis Morrisey
of Engine Company 319 in Queens, and Richard Savarese of Engine 310
in Brooklyn, were fined 30 days' pay each, while the eight others,
who had ``tarnished the good reputation'' of firefighters, were
fined five days' pay each, Von Essen said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also said that a rookie firefighter, James
Bruno, who was dismissed last month, had been reinstated because
``it became evident'' that he ``had no involvement in the serious
allegations of misbehavior.'' But he was fined 30 days' pay and his
probationary period was extended by six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges leveled against those responsible are often
referred to as conduct unbecoming the uniform,'' Von Essen said.
``I hope that this department has sent a strong message about our
uniform and the traditions that members of the New York City Fire
Department are compelled to uphold.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lynch, the Manhattan trustee of the Uniformed Firefighters
Association, called the penalties ``severe'' and said that his
union believed that the fracas had been ``highly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The penalties appeared to close the books on the most serious
breach of conduct by firefighters in years, an evening of drinking
and fighting that left faces bloody and city officials deeply
embarrassed. It seemed all the worse because it followed Medal Day
ceremonies in which heroic firefighters were honored at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the episode, investigators quoted witnesses as
saying that 50 to 100 firefighters had attended the celebration at
the awning-draped open air cafe, and that scores had joined in the
raucous conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigators also said it was unlikely that any of the
participants would face criminal charges unless the brawlers filed
complaints against one another, although some might face
departmental sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Von Essen, who had vowed to quickly investigate the incident and
punish those responsible, insisted Thursday that the department's
investigation, led by Assistant Commissioner Lai Sun Yee, head of
the Bureau of Investigations and Trials, had been ``exhaustive and
comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, he said, set up a ``war room'' with charts
and pictures of the cafe to place witnesses and suspects. Thousands
of pages of testimony were amassed from 70 witnesses, including 37
firefighters, he said. Credit card receipts were used to identify
some of those present.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from applauding the inquiry and imposing the penalties,
Von Essen did not detail the findings. But one investigator said
that no firefighter made a specific allegation against any other
firefighter, and that the investigation had been handicapped by a
dearth of evidence. No one testified to having seen firefighters
urinating in the bushes or running through the women's toilet, as
some witnesses had described, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the investigator said, a picture emerged, and he
characterized it as far less serious than originally depicted by
witnesses, including Donna Simms, the cafe manager. Instead of
hours of sporadic fisticuffs between men of rival fire companies,
he said, the fighting began about 10:15 p.m. with an exchange of
insults, lasted only 10 to 15 minutes and involved two principal
combatants and five to 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator described a scrumlike skirmish, in which most
participants were on the periphery, some digging to get in and
others holding comrades back. ``We're not saying they were
choirboys,'' the investigator said, ``but they were not all
throwing punches.''
</P>
<P>
   When the police arrived, all but a few firefighters had left,
and the only person arrested was a cafe bouncer, Ethan Kemp, who
was charged with assault and resisting arrest. He was said to have
thrown a police officer over a flower planter, mistaking him for a
firefighter he was trying to subdue. The charges were still
pending, but an official said he was not likely to be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas De Souza, another manager at the cafe, had no comment
Thursday night. He said Ms. Simms was out of town and unavailable
for comment.

CATHOLIC SCHOOL REHIRES TEACHER FIRED FOR MARRYING DIVORCED MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ A Roman Catholic school in Cortlandt Manor
agreed Thursday to rehire a teacher who was dismissed from her job
because she had married a divorced Episcopalian who had never had
his previous marriage annulled.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement to the confrontation between the teacher, Jeanne
Hearty, and Msgr. Patrick Keenan, the director of St. Columbanus
School outside Peekskill, came after it was determined that the
teacher's husband never needed a formal annulment _ which requires
a time-consuming investigation and hearings _ but a lesser
certificate simply confirming that his previous marriage had not
been valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Ms. Hearty and her husband, Terry
Barber, who obtained the certificate, were remarried Wednesday by a
Catholic priest in St. Columba Church in Hopewell Junction, N.Y. in
Dutchess County. Their earlier marriage had taken place in an
Episcopal church.
</P>
<P>
   In a stiff but cordial ceremony Thursday at the school, Ms.
Hearty, 36, and Keenan, 62, signed a new employment contract
allowing Ms. Hearty to resume her duties as a fifth-grade teacher
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very thankful that she got her contract,'' said Norine
Beaumont, Ms. Hearty's sister, speaking on behalf of Ms. Hearty.
``She did everything that was requested of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan declined to discuss the matter, but confirmed the
rehiring.
</P>
<P>
   Barber filed papers in April seeking an annulment. But the Roman
Catholic tribunal hearing the case in Poughkeepsie was not expected
to reach a conclusion before the start of the next school year, so
Keenan said he would not renew Ms. Hearty's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came when the tribunal discovered that Barber
did not need an annulment. Ms. Hearty's lawyer, Salvatore Lagonia,
and Ms. Beaumont said they were not certain of the intricate church
law involved, but Ms. Beaumont said that the key was that Barber
had previously married a Catholic convert to Judaism in an
Episcopalian ceremony. The tribunal found that the Catholic Church
does not recognize that ceremony, making an annulment unnecessary,
Ms. Beaumont said.
</P>
<P>
   Lagonia said that he understood that Cardinal John O'Connor had
intervened and ``made things happen.''

RICHARD ORANGE, 48; USED LOVE OF JAZZ AS MANAGEMENT AID

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard A. Orange Jr., a management consultant who
used his knowledge and love of jazz to help executives see the
strength of improvisation and teamwork, died June 4 at New York
University Hospital. He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a stroke, said his sister, Taur.
</P>
<P>
   Orange formed his own company, Richard A. Orange Jr. Associates,
in New York to help clients deal with such issues as diversity and
work better with middle managers.
</P>
<P>
   He drew on his experience of growing up in a working-class Bronx
community as a black child for insights on how to bring
African-Americans into executive positions.
</P>
<P>
   After participating in a diversity conference organized by
Orange, Charles Gifford, the chairman and chief executive of
BankBoston Corp., wrote in The Boston Globe: ``At the end of the
week, I had been enriched and stretched by seeing beneath the
surface of colleagues to their backgrounds and their stories, to
their burdens and their joys.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his clients were DuPont Co. and BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Queens College
and a master's degree in social psychology from the New School for
Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Portsmouth Consulting Group, a group of
senior consultants who met three times a year to share experiences.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a trainer of consultants at the NTL Institute for
Applied Behavioral Science.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, Orange is survived by his wife,
Trudy; his companion, Dr. E. Joyce Buchanan of New York; a
daughter, Courtney, of New York, and his father Richard, of New
York.

GROUP BUYS HELMSLEY STAKE IN TROUBLED BRONX CONDO COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A partnership led by the city's largest private
financier of multifamily housing has bought more than half of the
apartments in Parkchester, taking the first step in a $200 million
restoration of the huge condominium project in the eastern Bronx
that many thought was in danger of becoming a slum.
</P>
<P>
   CPC Resources Inc., an arm of the Community Preservation Corp.,
and two real-estate investors, Morton L. Olshan and Jeremiah W.
O'Connor Jr., paid just $4 million for the Parkchester holdings of
Leona Helmsley, whose late husband, Harry, had converted them into
condominiums in the 1970s. The Helmsley stake included 6,362
apartments, five parking garages and 88 retail stores, including
the only Macy's branch in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The new partners, who completed the acquisition on Wednesday,
intend to borrow $178 million to replace plumbing, wiring and more
than 65,000 windows throughout the 12,271-unit complex, which
sprawls across 130 acres between White Plains Road and Castle Hill
Avenue, just north of the Cross-Bronx Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, they must convince Parkchester's two condominium
boards to support the restoration plan, under which the $178
million loan would be paid off by owners through increases in their
monthly charges and residents would pay their own electricity bills
for the first time. If the plan wins the approval of the two
boards, said Michael Lappin, president of the Community
Preservation Corporation, condominium owners could vote on the plan
in early October.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has broad political support from politicians in the
city and state as well as community and religious leaders in the
area. But success is not a foregone conclusion. Lappin and his
partners do not control enough votes outright to win the October
election. And an outspoken group of opponents has emerged,
asserting that the proposed repairs are insufficient and that the
plan is too costly for residents, many of whom are elderly people
living on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Williams, a member of the group that opposes the plan,
the Parkchester Owners &AMP; Residents Association, said the renovation
scheme omits essential repairs like replacing leaky sewage pipes
and 60-year-old electrical wires, that would have to be made in
future years at additional cost. She vowed a bitter fight over the
summer. ``We're going to lay down in the streets,'' she said.
``We're going to stop traffic. We're going to jump up and down and
scream, `This is not a good deal for Parkchester.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lappin, however, said the plan had been designed to do what was
absolutely necessary while minimizing the cost to residents. Each
owner will have to pay about $95 a month toward the debt and a
reserve fund, he said. But because of an expected real estate tax
abatement, residents could save $53 a month in taxes. A $25 monthly
electricity charge will be eliminated, replaced by individual
electrical bills estimated at $44 a month. All told, barring a
spike in interest rates, the net increase in cost should not exceed
$74 a month on average, Lappin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lappin's Community Preservation Corp., a lending consortium of
New York's major banks, will also offer refinancing to Parkchester
residents, many who bought their apartments at high interest rates
and have been unable to obtain new mortgages because of the decline
in property values in the area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parkchester Preservation Corp. could earn substantial profits if
the renovation plan is successful and it is able to sell the
apartments it now owns, 800 of which are vacant and the rest
occupied by renters. Prices for two- and three-bedroom apartments
there ranged between $20,000 and $30,000 in recent years, and a
refurbished Parkchester could drive values higher, Lappin said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the restoration plan hailed the purchase as the
first step in the revival of a community that once was considered a
jewel of the Bronx. Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who lived in
Parkchester as a newlywed, said Parkchester's slide into decay was
apparent more than a decade ago and had begun to threaten
surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Parkchester went, so would that whole section of the East
Bronx,'' he said. ``In a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceived as a ``park-like suburb'' when much of the eastern
Bronx remained undeveloped, Parkchester was built on winding lanes
radiating from a sculptured fountain at the Metropolitan Oval
between 1938 and 1940 by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Helmsley
bought it in 1968 and, four years later, began converting it from
rental apartments to condominiums. After sales faltered in the late
1980s and early 1990s, Helmsley began leasing its unsold
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Parkchester had fallen into disrepair and the Helmsley
interests were losing money, when Lappin, encouraged by Ferrer and
other political and community leaders, began negotiating the
purchase and planning the rehabilitation.

U.S. PROSECUTORS WIDEN PROBE OF POLICE BRUTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors investigating whether a pattern
of brutality or misconduct exists in the New York City Police
Department are seeking access to a deposition in which a senior
police official discussed his inability to have Officer Francis
Livoti transferred in 1991 despite nine brutality complaints filed
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after high-ranking police officials rejected the
transfer of Livoti, he was accused in the choking death of Anthony
Baez during an arrest in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Livoti, who was
dismissed from the force in 1997, of violating Baez's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Zachary Carter, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn,
to seek a copy of the deposition of Deputy Chief William Casey
comes as part of a broad look by Carter's office at how the
department handles abuse complaints. Carter's office requested a
copy of the deposition earlier this week from a Bronx Supreme Court
justice who is presiding in a civil lawsuit the Baez family has
brought against the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Carter began his investigation into the department after police
officers in a Brooklyn station house were accused of attacking
Abner Louima last August. The civil investigation is being
conducted under a 1994 law that allows the government to
investigate misconduct by law enforcement agencies and, where it
finds a pattern of wrongdoing, to sue in an attempt to force
institutional change under court order.
</P>
<P>
   Carter declined any comment Thursday on his investigation, which
lawyers outside his office said they believed was looking at
hundreds of cases of officers who have been the subject of multiple
brutality complaints and how those cases were resolved by the
department.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, Casey, who was Livoti's commander in the 46th
Precinct at the time, testified that his recommendation that Livoti
be transferred in 1991 was rejected by Louis Anemone, now chief of
department, and by a second official.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that Anemone believed the brutality
complaints were not substantiated, and they also cited Livoti's
status as a police union delegate.
</P>
<P>
   The department's critics, including lawyers for the Baez family,
say that the chief's testimony raises questions about the
department's commitment to combating brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of depositions in civil suits varies from case
to case, but Carter's office apparently had to go to Justice
Douglas McKeon for a copy because parts of the 237-page document
that concern specific brutality complaints against Livoti remain
under seal.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, said that Livoti's 500 arrests
over his 15 years on the force placed him in the top echelon of
police officers, and the number of complaints against him was
extremely low by comparison. Most of the complaints were found to
be unsubstantiated, London said, adding that Livoti denies
wrongdoing in every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti, who was acquitted on state charges of criminally
negligent homicide in 1996 in the death of Baez, plans to appeal
last week's conviction in the civil rights case, London said.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent civil rights trial, federal prosecutors accused
three officers of lying to protect Livoti. Police Commissioner
Howard Safir elaborated Thursday on the decision to place the three
officers on modified leave until the Police Department completes
its investigation into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three _ Sgt. William Monahan and Officers Mario
Erotokritou and Anthony Farnan _ testified that he did not see
Livoti use a choke hold on Baez. Another officer, Daisy Boria,
testified that officers had planned to lie to absolve Livoti of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing an investigation to see whether or not they were
involved in misconduct,'' Safir said. ``It is my judgment that they
should not be on the street until this has been resolved one way or
the other.'' A separate criminal investigation is being conducted
by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department declined to allow the three officers to be
interviewed Thursday. London, who is also a lawyer for the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, criticized the department's
decision to put the officers on modified duty, saying that it would
have a ``chilling effect'' on ``the entire police force.'' He also
said the officers had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Safir, questioned about Anemone's decision to reject
Livoti's transfer in 1991, said: ``Let me be clear: we're looking
at all aspects of the case relative to these three individuals. I
am not investigating Chief Anemone.''  &QL;

health and community affairs in Westchester County, died on Monday
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 58 and lived in
Ossining, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was throat cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Galef, who was a senior partner in the firm of Wormser, Kiely,
Galef &AMP; Jacobs, was instrumental in turning the county-operated
Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., over to a public
benefit corporation last year. He also was a central figure in
developing the medical center's new Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    CLINTON SET TO MEET HONG KONG DEMOCRATIC LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    EDS: Updates with latest Clinton remarks at top. 
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Clinton's low-key meetings on Friday with
Hong Kong opposition legislators will be his only chance to hear
critics of the ruling Chinese communist party regime during his
nine-day trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing to fly home late Friday for a Fourth of July greeting
at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington at dawn on Saturday,
Clinton spoke about how Hong Kong's still limited democracy can
inspire the long-term future for the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fundamental interest in promoting stability and
prosperity in Asia,'' Clinton said in what was billed as a major
speech Friday morning to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future is tied to Asia's. A large and growing percentage
of our exports, our imports and our investments involve Asian
nations,'' Clinton said in a hoarse voice.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in a dinner toast a few hours after arriving here
Thursday night, Clinton said the future ``will be difficult, but
most of it will be very good'' if China is able to ``stay on the
right side of history.'' He referred to his remarks last fall when
he told President Jiang Zemin that defending China's 1989 crackdown
on democracy advocates put him on the wrong side of history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was exchanging toasts with Tung Chee-hwa, the
Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong who immediately
abolished the elected legislature last summer, when Britain turned
its one-time colony back to Chinese control after more than 150
years of British rule.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton was scheduled to meet privately with the
leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, Martin Lee, and other
democratic activists who are working for multi-party democracy in
the only bit of China where any high-level democratic elections are
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a fiery lawyer, told journalists: ``I was impressed by the
president's joint press conference with Jiang Zemin and believe the
fact that it was televised live in China was a significant
development for the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even here, only one third of the Legislative Council members are
elected now. The rest are appointed by pro-Beijing professional and
social groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's talks with members of what in Hong Kong is a tolerated
opposition fall short of qualifying as a meeting with dissidents.
The White House vacillated in the days before Clinton left on his
China tour about whether the president would have face-to-face
talks with any dissidents who face arrest or labor camp terms for
speaking out against Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Clinton met neither with political dissidents
nor with leaders of China's burgeoning underground churches.
</P>
<P>
   His ostensible objective was to insulate dissidents living in
China from being harassed in the future. However, clearly another
part of the calculation was trying to spare his Chinese official
hosts from the negative publicity that would attend such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The White House even tried to downplay the meetings with Lee and
others in Hong Kong's elected opposition, refusing to allow
American or Chinese television to film any part of the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in Hong Kong, Clinton could have met some of the most
effective human rights monitors keeping track of what is happening
to dissidents on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Lu Si Qing, for example, runs a shoestring operation called
International Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movements in
China, which reports frequently to journalists by fax or cellphone
about Chinese dissidents who are arrested or simply disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lu's organization that put out news of several dissidents
detained in the days before Clinton arrived in China, detentions
which prompted angry White House reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Lu escaped from detention on the mainland and gained asylum in
Hong Kong while Britain still was in control. His organization is
considered subversive by Chinese authorities, but the observance of
free speech and free press here in Hong Kong has kept him from
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people not very famous, the police can do many things,''
he said in a recent interview. ``For the very famous, the Western
countries help them. For the thousands who nobody knows their
names, how can the Western nations care about them?''
</P>
<P>
   A high profile meeting with Clinton would provide at least some
shield of protection for activists like Lu.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival in Hong Kong came one day after the special
autonomous region celebrated the first anniversary of the handover
back to China.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials opened the new Chek Lap Kok International
Airport in conjunction with the anniversary on Wednesday, and Air
Force One was the first plane with passengers to land at the
airport Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential party was greeted with lion-costumed dancers,
drums and gongs.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Clinton's arrival, a group of about 20
anti-American demonstrators staged a protest in front of the U.S.
consulate to denounce Washington's security pact with Japan, which
allows U.S. forces to use Japanese logistical support in case of
regional crises.
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator held up a cartoon caricature of Clinton in the
shape of a turtle, something considered an obnoxious insult in
China.

GRAND CANYON VILLAGE PLAN IS CHOSEN: NO ONE PLEASED
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of wrangling over how to develop a tourist gateway
to the Grand Canyon, the federal government has chosen a plan, but
the solution pleases no one.
</P>
<P>
   Of eight possible plans, the U.S. Forest Service on Thursday
selected the most scaled-down version for Canyon Forest Village,
eliminating most of what the Scottsdale-based developers hoped
would preserve the Canyon's delicate ecosystems and turn their
project into an international model.
</P>
<P>
   And in an unusual twist, nine national environmental groups an
nounced they will campaign to allow Canyon Forest Village to build
a larger project. They want the developers to be able to pay for
environmental improvements, espe cially those to prevent the
Canyon's springs and the world-famous Hava supai waterfalls from
going dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needs to be a model for the entire national park system,
and for parks internationally,'' said Charles Clusen, senior policy
ana lyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington,
D.C. Arizona's geologic formation is the nation's second most
popular national park (following Great Smokey Mountains), and two
of every five Canyon visitors are from another nation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by business and property owners in the nearby
town of Tusayan _ seven miles south of the Canyon rim _ also
condemned the Forest Service selection because it would mean more
competition without making any environmental improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the proposals the Forest Service could have selected,
this is absolutely the worst one,'' said Rick Lopez, a Flagstaff
city councilman and chairman of No On Canyon Forest Village.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the Forest Service selection will be the easiest to
defeat because no one likes it. He hopes plans for Canyon Forest
Village will dissolve, and Arizona can begin a campaign to regain
business from Las Vegas. The casino capital in recent years has
become the leading jump-off point for Canyon visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tom De Paolo, managing general partner of Canyon Forest Village,
said he was disappointed by the Forest Service pick, but he vowed,
with the help of the environmental groups, to push for a larger
develop ment that would enable environmen tal improvements.
</P>
<P>
   De Paolo said his partnership would make the same amount of
money from either plan, but that his group is committed to pursue
an environmentally sensitive design.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the Forest Service's preferred alternative triggers a
45-day public comment period that runs from July 17 through Septem
ber 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service review was prompted by park officials' predic
tions that annual visitation at the Canyon will increase to as many
as 6.8 million visitors by 2010, a 36 percent increase from the 5
mil lion visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision about what to do is expected early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service spokeswoman Cathie Schmidlin said the alterna
tive suggested Thursday was a compromise. She said it took ac count
of the need for park-employee housing, community services in
Tusayan, the concerns of other tourism-dependent communities and
the Forest Service's desire to acquire 12 private parcels scattered
across the Kaibab National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village, which owns the inholdings, proposes to
trade 2,184 acres of private prop erty, mostly old ranches, to the
Forest Service in exchange for about 270 acres of Forest Service
land along Arizona 64 at the main entrance to the park.
</P>
<P>
   The larger development requested by Canyon Forest Village would
require two acres more than the smaller development recommended by
the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of environmental groups said there needs to be one
place away from the Canyon wilder ness for visitors to sleep, eat
and buy things. It should be linked to the park by mass transit,
minimize its impact on the environment and permit it to serve large
numbers of visitors far into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the environmen tal improvements offered by Canyon
Forest Village is a plan to haul water from the Colorado River _
not as it runs through the Canyon _ but 220 miles away at Topock,
along the Arizona-California line. The water would be hauled by
rail to near Williams and then piped from there to the edge of the
park.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of that water, and other environmental improvements _
so lar energy, water and energy conser vation, recycled materials,
wastewater reclamation without chemicals, lighting that doesn't
wash out the stars _ would require a larger development to pay for
them, environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   The water plan for Canyon Forest Village also could provide
water for existing development inside the park at Grand Canyon
Village, environ mentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   Park facilities along the South Rim currently rely on a pipeline
that carries water from Roaring Springs, below the North Rim of the
canyon. The pipeline generally follows the North Kaibab and Bright
Angel trails, and crosses the river near Phantom Ranch.
Environmentalists say the pipeline often is broken by landslides,
requiring constant main tenance and robbing the canyon of water for
wildlife and hikers.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists admit they are in an awkward role backing
a developer. But by allowing Canyon Forest Village to build a large
development, they said, the partner ship will have the money needed
to protect the Canyon environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In attempting to pare down the original proposal, they (Forest
Serv ice) lost all the things that made the proposal attractive in
the first place,'' said Brad Ack, director of conservation programs
for the Flag staff-based Grand Canyon Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists say some new development is going to
happen near the Grand Canyon in the future, and _ despite recent im
provements _ they do not trust the developers in the nearby tourist
town of Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   Tusayan developers maintain that they already have paved
sidewalks, installed street lighting, adopted landscape, color and
design schemes aimed at matching the historic character of the
West, and devel oped energy- and water-saving tech niques.
</P>
<P>
   They say their town, and sur rounding communities like Flagstaff
and Williams, are ready to provide the needs of growing numbers of
park visitors without establishing a ``new city.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said that with out the land trade that would
accompany the Canyon Forest Vil lage plan, they fear the scattered
private lands will be developed in a haphazard fashion, using more
un derground water and reducing the ability of a planned
mass-transit system to serve park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Canyon Forest Vil lage contend the land trade is
unfair to taxpayers, that the Forest Service has refused to make
public its appraisals of the land values, that Canyon Forest
Village would swamp the tourism market, leaving estab lished
northern Arizona communi ties in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have lined up in support of Canyon Forest
Village behind the Grand Canyon Trust, the National Resource De
fense Council and the National Parks and Conservation Association.
They are: the Wilderness Society, American Rivers, the National
Trust for Historic Preservation, Scenic America, Global
Environmental Op tions and the Environmental De fense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, the nation's largest environmental group, is
holding out for limits on the number of visitors, and opposes any
new development near the Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club maintains that all the proposals to serve the
antici pated increases in park visitors focus too much on economic
con siderations, instead of environmental needs, especially water,
waste dis posal and impacts on wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of ``ecological considerations'' are critical to
main taining a quality outdoor recreation experience for people,
according to Rick Isetts, editor of Canyon Echo, the newsletter of
the Sierra Club's Arizona members.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (ecological) values,'' Is etts said, ``are incompatible
with materialistic interests that are best managed by a shopping
mall located appropriately in a larger city, cer tainly not on the
border of our greatest national park.'' &QL;

METS PLUCK BLUE JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The experiment is only two days old. But so far, Mets
Manager Bobby Valentine's juxtapositioning of John Olerud and Mike
Piazza in the heart of his struggling lineup has been nothing short
of promising. And it won't be long now before Todd Hundley arrives
to take a little heat off Piazza, too.
</P>
<P>
   To which, Piazza might respond, it's about time. Ever since the
Mets acquired Piazza from the Florida Marlins on May 22, Valentine
had been reluctant to bat the All-Star catcher anywhere other than
third, where Piazza has batted for most of his career. But after an
initial offensive explosion with the addition of Piazza to the
lineup, the Mets had reverted to their meek-hitting ways until
Wednesday, when Valentine had the slumping Olerud move from cleanup
to third and Piazza take his place batting fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets responded by scoring 10 runs in a loss to Toronto on
Wednesday, and Thursday evening they enjoyed a 9-1 thrashing of the
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by eight strong innings of five-hit ball from Bobby
Jones (7-5), the Mets (44-36) won for just the second time in their
last six games, averting a three-game sweep at the Skydome. Only a
two-out seventh-inning home run by Carlos Delgado foiled a shutout
by Jones, who had retired 16 straight Blue Jays in a row.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco pitched the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud and Piazza gave Jones, who won for the first time since
June 11, all the runs he needed in the third. Olerud doubled home
Edgardo Alfonzo from second base just before Piazza drilled his
14th home run of the season to give the Mets a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored eight runs off former American League Cy Young
award winner Pat Hentgen in just five innings. And other than
Delgado's homer, all the 27,325 fans had to cheer about was
40-year-old Dave Stieb's return home in his first appearance at the
Skydome since July 29, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Stieb came on in the seventh to pitch three
perfect innings, the Mets were already up by 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo and Olerud appear to be the two main beneficiaries of
the subtle lineup switch. Alfonzo homered twice and drove in three
runs in Wednesday's loss, before going 3-for-4 with a double and
three runs scored tonight. Olerud was 3-for-4 with a triple and a
three-run homer Wednesday and then 2-for-4 with a run-scoring
double Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Piazza has had some runners on base to drive
in. Coming in to the game, the slugging catcher had just 27 at-bats
with runners in scoring position in 31 games with the Mets. He was
batting just .185 with five hits and no homers in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been anxious, which is why I've been swinging at bad
pitches,'' Piazza said before the game. ``I've been trying to do
too much with a runner on third and a runner on second with two
out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Piazza hasn't seen many chances to drive people in with less
than two out. Imagine, then, how he must have felt in the top of
the first when Shawn Green robbed him of extra bases with a diving
catch in center field with Alfonzo on second and Olerud on first.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza made sure no one could catch his third-inning shot, a
homer to right. And once Hundley arrives from his minor-league
injury rehabilitation period, which could be next week, Piazza will
have an offensive force behind him to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   During the voluble chewing out he took in the visiting clubhouse
after Wednesday's eighth-inning fiasco, Mel Rojas said Manager
Bobby Valentine told him, ``It didn't look like I want to pitch.''
Rojas, whose earned run average over his last six appearances is
25.07, sounded as confused as anyone by his struggles. It is
obvious that he doesn't trust his fastball anymore. And he admitted
that it would not be good for the team to put him in a set-up role
until he can pitch his way out of his current funk. Rojas said,
however, that the minor-leagues were not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter remained optimistic that he would be able to pitch
shortly after he is eligible to come off the disabled list July 12.
``I think I'll miss just one start after the All-Star break,'' said
Leiter, who has a 15 percent tear of the patella tendon in his left
knee. Jim Leyland, who will manage the National League All-Star
team, said on Thursday that he would have named Leiter to his staff
had he not been injured. ... Hideo Nomo (lower back strain) said he
felt a little better and that the Mets would decide after the
All-Star break as to when he would next pitch.

ITALIAN STAR LEARNED FROM HIS DAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ He's a loner, unpopular with teammates, or
so it is whispered. He's less than cordial with those who sign his
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   He's a night owl, preferring to dance the night away at discos
than get the rest his coaches and trainers think he needs.
</P>
<P>
   And he's less than a perfect practice player, accused of not
trying hard enough in training, of not being in the sort of shape
one expects of world-class soccer players.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian Vieri's excesses have been indulged because of his
ability to put the ball in the net, a skill that has made him _ and
not the far more celebrated Alessandro Del Piero or Roberto Baggio
_ the most dangerous striker at this World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Vieri will be looking for his sixth goal of the
tournament this afternoon when he leads Italy against France in a
hugely anticipated quarterfinal showdown at the Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero, the reigning superstar of Italian soccer, was
supposed to be the Azzurri's primary striker and Baggio their
deadly old hand. Instead, it's been Vieri with a stirring goal
against Chile, two more goals against Cameroon, another against
Austria, and another in the second-round triumph over Norway. Vieri
has been the difference between a decent Italian side and one that
might capture the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true, at the moment I'm going through a very good
period,'' Vieri acknowledged. ``Five goals is great, and of course
I am very happy. I want to do better, I want to score more goals.
But above all, I want to go as far as possible in the competition
with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieri, who shares the World Cup scoring lead with Argentina's
Gabriel Batistuta, led the Spanish League in scoring last season
for Atletico de Madrid, which spent $20 million to acquire him from
Juventus. His coach, Raddy Antic, accused him of ``shutting the
door at the local disco,'' but he is considered untouchable
because, no matter the situation, he puts the ball in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a striker,'' he says matter-of-factly, ``and scoring goals
is my job.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a burly forward, a direct player who learned the game and
gained his skills from his father, Roberto, a standout with
Juventus, Sampdoria, Torino and AS Roma before heading to Australia
to coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My father) always tells me what I'm doing wrong; there's no
point in him telling me what I'm doing right,'' Christian said.
``And after all, he's got the right to do so. He was a great
footballer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only seen bits of matches he played, recorded on old
tapes, but when I was little we played together in our garden in
Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off after the family returned to Italy when Christian
was 15. He soon signed his first contract, apprenticed in Italy's
lower divisions, then helped Italy win the European under-21
championships in 1992 and 1994 before earning his big break with
Atalanta. He scored nine times in 17 games and was sent to
Juventus, Italy's biggest club.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Del Piero, whose silkier skills complement the
more muscular Vieri's in coach Cesare Maldini's big-little attack,
has received far more of the acclaim, but Vieri's nose for the goal
has been more beneficial in France. His goal against Norway, in a
1-0 victory, was prototypical: He ran onto a throughball from Luigi
di Biagio, outran and outbattled defender Dan Eggen to the box,
then blasted past goalkeeper Frode Grodas.
</P>
<P>
   He had little to say about the goal or any of his goals, but
that's nothing new. ``I'm the silent type,'' he said. ``I don't
talk much and I like it that way. The only time I really enjoy
myself is when I'm on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not seem that way. He doesn't celebrate his goals with
the exuberance of his teammates, but he considers himself more
misunderstood than unapproachable. And scoring goals, he says, is
of secondary importance. Unlike Batistuta, Vieri doesn't care
whether or not he wins the Golden Boot as the World Cup's top
scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years to come,'' he said, ``I shall be happy to say I was
at the most important tournament in football. That's enough.''

COMMENTARY: PRIDE IN COFFEE IS ELEVATED TO A NEW ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Francisco Rivera Rosa likes his coffee jet black and
jet-fuel strong. He's particularly partial to a bitter blend that's
thick as paste. ``No milk, no sugar,'' he insists. ``No anything.''
Except for the occasional splash of watercolor. Or acrylic. Or mud.
</P>
<P>
   This is no java jive. Rivera Rosa is a Puerto Rican artist who
has been painting and sculpting with coffee for the last three
years. He called the technique Arfe, combining the Spanish words
for art and coffee. Embracing a self-referential realism, he uses
the sepia medium to render lush landscapes of his native island's
plantations and haciendas. His harvest _ as he calls his collection
_ celebrates one of Puerto Rico's most treasured exports, a brew
savored by everyone from popes to peasants.
</P>
<P>
   A number of those pieces are on exhibit at the Union Square
branch of Touro College, held over for an extended run after
finding an audience that has been eager to support a new cultural
endeavor. While the ``Seinfeld'' crowd milked cheap laughs by
burning the Puerto Rican flag in a recent episode, the people who
have discovered Rivera Rosa's paintings know that their community
appreciates the fine arts. Even the fine-grind kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to use the process of our education to talk about our
roots,'' said Felipe Morales Millan, the college's director. ``Many
of our students are Puerto Rican, and sometimes they know about
their culture, sometimes they do not. I wanted to use this exhibit
to reaffirm this new craft and give them something about their
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of you whose talent is limited to making brown rings on
your desktop or amoebalike splotches on shirts, take heart. Rivera
Rosa also discovered his new medium by accident a few years ago
while doing watercolors in his studio in Humacao, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drinking coffee, and I noticed this drop on a scrap of
paper,'' he said. ``It looked like when it fell, it made certain
tones and contours. I had to look into the alternatives with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Milagros Martinez Schettini, researched the
history of coffee on the island and experimented with different
beans and roasts. They learned that they could coax yellows,
purples and greens with some tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get different tones, you have to consider how much the bean
has been roasted,'' he said. ``It's like when you prepare a gourmet
coffee, you look at how it has been roasted to achieve different
tastes and colors. It's also important how much water you evaporate
after it has been brewed.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses the resulting paste alone or with other paints. He has
also mixed it with mud for some surrealistic sculptures _ no mugs
yet. His beans come from a local roaster who saves the burned
batches that would have been tossed, although once Rivera Rosa
rushed to a fast-food joint for a cup of really strong espresso
when he ran out of his special brew in mid-painting. Unlike the
stuff he drinks, bitter is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because coffee is somewhat acidic, that is good,'' he said.
``That way no little animals can eat away at it. Also, when the sun
hits watercolors, they fade from the ultraviolet rays. When we mix
our coffee pigment with it, it's like adding a solar filter.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of last month, Rivera Rosa and his wife were in town to
promote their new technique among galleries and artists. And yes,
he has noticed what some people call coffee, though he has yet to
work with the local stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they make it, you can almost see through it,'' he
said. ``It's very yellow. It's so clear. They're diluting it too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Latin from Manhattan could have told him that. A few did
this week, when a group from the Lower East Side trooped through
the college's corridor gallery to see scenes of weather-beaten
shacks, pre-Columbian stone carvings and lots of coffee beans
ripening on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to eat those,'' said Rafael Ruiz, recalling with a
nostalgic smile how he used to help his mother grind coffee. ``This
is historic stuff about real life. When you're a kid, you don't
realize its importance, but when you're an adult, you do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, someone asked Rivera Rosa if he ever tried any
of the flavored coffees sold in gourmet shops and espresso bars. He
winced. The man who mixes on his palette prefers purity for his
palate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never mix coffee with banana or strawberry syrups,''
he said. ``Coffee is coffee and banana is banana. To mix it is to
have a strange combination. That makes no sense.''

COURT SETS GUIDELINES ON JUROR-BIAS INQUIRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ The Connecticut Supreme Court established new,
rigorous guidelines Thursday for how a trial court should
investigate allegations of racial bias by jurors, after finding in
a decision released Thursday that a judge should have done more to
look into such claims in a murder trial here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 3-2, that a trial judge must pursue questions
of a juror's racial bias more thoroughly than other types of jury
misconduct because it is so critical to the public's confidence in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also means that the case of Adrian Santiago, who
was convicted of murder in February 1996, must be reopened so that
the trial judge can apply the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after Santiago was convicted, a juror, June
Briere, said that she had heard another juror use a racial slur
against Santiago in the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Ms. Briere became so convinced of Santiago's
innocence that she has paid for his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision requires that when a claim is made that a juror has
racial or ethnic bias, the trial judge should, at a minimum,
interview the person making the claim, any possible witnesses to
demonstrations of racial bias and the accused juror.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Parrent, a lawyer with the Connecticut Civil Liberties
Union, praised the decision. ``These are the most rigorous set of
guidelines I've seen issued by any court for dealing with claims of
racially biased jurors,'' Ms. Parrent said, adding that the rules
should provide a model for other states.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the court said that the trial judge, Samuel
Sferrazza, correctly followed the existing guidelines for
investigating possible jury misconduct. The judge had interviewed
both Ms. Briere and the jury foreman before finding Ms. Briere's
account not credible.
</P>
<P>
   But in Thursday's decision, Associate Justice Flemming Norcott
Jr. wrote: ``A trial court must be especially vigilant in
investigating the specter of racial prejudice in the judicial
process. Failure to scrupulously explore such allegations would
seem to enhance the risk of a conviction based on race. Such a risk
cannot be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Chief Justice Robert Callahan said such an
extensive inquiry into even meritless allegations was ``unnecessary
and ill advised.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Longstreth, the senior assistant state's attorney, said
she was disappointed with the decision, but said she was confident
the conviction would stand.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Briere, 62, who continues to drive several hours six times a
month to visit Santiago in prison, said: ``I want it all out in the
open. I don't know what the outcome will be. But I'm in here to
fight till it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, a reputed member of the Nietas gang, was convicted of
killing Fernando Ilarraza, 17, a reputed gang member and drug
dealer in Willimantic, in 1993, after two friends said he told them
about the murder.

TEXAS YOUTH, 13, IN CUSTODY OVER BURNING OF BOY ON 8TH BIRTHDAY 

</HEADLINE>

By PAUL McKAY 
and STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPLENDORA, Texas _ A 13-year-old boy, who police say has
admitted being present when 8-year-old Robert Middleton was set
ablaze, was taken into custody Thursday and later escorted to the
scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-set teen-ager, who has not been formally charged for
the gruesome attack on the boy but will be held in juvenile
detention at least until Monday, may have been angry at the boy for
having tattled about his witnessing the teen molesting a younger
child in the woods, sources close to the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have information that Robert told people he saw (the
teen) molesting a child in the woods some time ago,'' said a
Montgomery County sheriff's investigator.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that authorities have not confirmed that that
was the motive for the Sunday afternoon attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not been formally charged, but he has admitted being
there when the 8-year-old was set on fire,'' Sheriff Guy Williams
said. ``We're making progress, but we're now going to have to
question some other people and keep investigating.``
</P>
<P>
   Williams said other arrests are possible.
</P>
<P>
   The teen was accompanied by sheriff's deputies Thursday night as
they headed down the heavily wooded trail northwest of Splendora
where Robert was doused with gasoline and set on fire near his home
on his 8th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Splendora is about 30 miles north of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Robert, who is being treated at Shriners Burns
Hospital-Galveston for third-degree burns over 99 percent of his
body, was unable to speak but was able to communicate to hospital
officials Thursday morning that the juvenile now in custody was
present when he was burned.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's detective said the boy's communication was enough
for officers to pick up the teen-ager for questioning. The youth
was riding in a pickup with his half-sister's father shortly before
noon when officers took the juvenile into custody at gunpoint.
Deputies promptly released the man.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile's 23-year-old half-sister, who said Thursday night
that she is his legal guardian, said the boy was leaving for a
fishing trip with her father when the police made the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have to harass my father the way they did, and I
can't believe they handcuffed a 13-year-old boy,'' the sister said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and the boy are related maternally and that their
mother died three years ago. Her brother's biological father, she
said, ``is nowhere around.``
</P>
<P>
   The sister and other relatives of the boy were nearby when he
emerged from the woods with the investigators Thursday night on the
street where Robert Middleton lives with his parents and two
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come and get me,'' the boy mouthed repeatedly to his tearful
sister.
</P>
<P>
   The opening in the woods is the same location where Robert,
known around the neighborhood as ``Robby,'' emerged 40 yards from
his house around 5:45 p.m. Sunday. Investigators say Robert was
heading down the trail to a friend's house in another section of
the rural subdivision but was doused with gasoline and set on fire
a short distance down the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The charred boy managed to walk back to the street in an obvious
attempt to get back to his house when a neighbor came to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors have told investigators that Robert named another
13-year-old boy as the one who had burned him. They said Robert
told them that the boy was upset at him and had thrown gasoline on
him.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators confirmed Thursday that that boy, who lives
with his mother near the Middletons' home, was away from the
neighborhood Sunday around the time of the burning and has been
cleared of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why that youth's name had surfaced, Williams
would say only that ``that was a goose chase.``
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they are exploring the possibility that
Robert may have uttered the youth's name shortly after he was
burned because he was scared of further retaliation by the
teen-ager who is in custody. But investigators cautioned that
information they have from Robert himself remains so sketchy that
they can't be certain of many details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been almost like investigating a homicide,'' Williams
said. ``The boy wasn't able to tell us anything until today.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the youth whom Robert first named said she and her
son are relieved that he has been cleared. She noted that he is an
A-student and athlete at his Splendora school. One of his teachers
confirmed Thursday that the boy ``is a good kid and excellent
student.``
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they have confirmed that that boy was with a
group of youths and adults at a swimming hole Sunday evening around
the time that Robert was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Shriners hospital said that Robert underwent four
hours of skin-graft surgery Monday and faces as many as 14 more
surgeries in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Herndon noted that the most critical time for the
boy's survival probably has passed, although the threat of
infection and pneumonia remain.
</P>
<P>
   Robert is under pain and anti-anxiety medications and is wrapped
in heavy dressings that are changed once a day, Herndon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a very long road to travel,'' Herndon said. ``One
never fully recovers from this kind of burn.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He noted that many such child patients go on to thrive as
students by ``overcompensating with their minds. They do better in
school than their peer groups. They're heroes of the greatest
order.``
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents, Bobby Ray and Colleen Middleton, both 35, and
their other two siblings have been ``sustained by the prayers of
well-wishers and the donations of money and blood,'' said Craig
Middleton, Robert's paternal uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned that an arrest was made in the case, he noted
that ``I had my faith in the sheriff's department all along.``

HOW HOME SALE LED TO DISCOVERY OF 2 MURDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 14 years, the bodies of two murder victims, a young
man and a teen-age girl, were hidden in a crude and shallow grave
beneath the crawl space of a tiny Cape Cod house near Atlantic
City, N.J. The homicides might not have been discovered, the
authorities said Thursday, but for the sale of the house and the
new owner's plans to remodel it.
</P>
<P>
   After detectives had spent two days digging and sifting dirt
from the crawl space and backyard at the house, Atlantic County
Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz said Thursday that two skeletons, shreds
of clothing, three bullets, a baseball bat and a wallet were found
in the three-foot grave beneath 402 Ireland Ave. in Northfield,
N.J. Blitz said his investigators were satisfied that there were no
other bodies buried on the property.
</P>
<P>
   The former owner of the house, Ernest Ireland, 51, an unemployed
bachelor who has been living in a trailer park in Pleasantville,
N.J., has been charged with murder and is being held in $350,000
bail at the Atlantic County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged late Monday, only a few hours after the new owner
of the house, Bruce Trielo, began excavations in the crawl space
and turned up a thigh bone. Trielo, who had bought the house as an
investment in late May, was planning to enlarge it, first by
putting in a full basement, Blitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The house at 402 Ireland Ave. was the first of six built on the
tiny dead-end street. It was named after Ireland's forebears who
were its first settlers, said a woman who has lived on a nearby
street for 33 years. The woman, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said Ireland had lived alone since his mother died in
the mid-1970s. ``You saw him alone all the time, walking or riding
a bike,'' she said. ``He never talked to anybody, and I passed him
almost every day on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland Avenue was an odd mix of images Thursday. Bricks and
cinder blocks brought in for the remodeling were piled outside
Trielo's house, next to mounds of freshly dug dirt. Across the
street, deliverymen came with supplies for a Fourth of July weekend
picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Several neighbors declined to talk about Ireland or the murders.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor refused to say Thursday whether Ireland had made
a statement. But, he said, his staff believed that the murders
occurred in Ireland's kitchen in late January 1985 and that Ireland
dragged the bodies outside and hid them in the freshly dug grave in
the crawl space.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims has been identified as Barry Dallman, of
Pleasantville, which is adjacent to Northfield. He died of a
gunshot to the spine at age 21, Blitz said. Dallman was identified
through papers found in the wallet discovered in the grave. Blitz
described Dallman only as an acquaintance of Ireland's. He declined
to discuss a possible motive for the murders.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age girl has not been identified. She died of blows to
the head, Blitz said. The county medical examiner has determined,
through examination of a pelvic bone, that she was in her early
teens, the prosecutor said. He said detectives believed that the
remains might be those of a 14-year-old girl reported missing by
her foster parents shortly after they dropped her off at
Pleasantville High School on Jan. 24, 1985. She is thought to have
been Dallman's girlfriend, Blitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives are now searching the Atlantic City area for dentists
who may have treated the girl and kept dental records.
</P>
<P>
   Blitz said the chances of finding a dentist with such records
were slim. ``After all,'' he said, ``it's been 14 years.''

RANGERS SIGN FRASER, A WING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While they continued negotiations for several
high-profile free agents Thursday, the New York Rangers announced
the signing of one who is lesser known. Agreeing to terms was Scott
Fraser, a 26-year-old who calls himself ``an up and down right
winger.''
</P>
<P>
   In 29 games with Edmonton last season, Fraser _ whose
traditional style blends offense and defense _ cored 12 goals and
had 11 assists. He was an unrestricted, Group 6 free agent because
his contract had expired, he is more than 25 years old and he had
been a professional for three seasons while playing fewer than 80
professional games. The Rangers owe Edmonton no compensation for
his signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a late bloomer,'' said Fraser, who will earn about $4
million over a three-year contract. His base salary last season was
$310,000.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, there was no announcement regarding the
Rangers' goalie question. The Rangers have been negotiating with
Mike Richter, the incumbent, and Curtis Joseph, who last played
with Edmonton. Both are unrestricted free agents.

   NEW YORK _ Drew Nieporent, who as an owner of the TriBeCa Grill
and Nobu has had experience in the care and feeding of food
critics, played one in a film. And no, it is not a film by one of
the other partners in the restaurants, Robert De Niro.

   The film, ``Vanilla Fog,'' is a comedy starring the heroine of
television's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' Sarah Michelle Gellar,
and Sean Patrick Flanery. In a scene that was almost certain to
send foodies into popcorn-dropping shock, Nieporent was supposed to
play a food critic for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But Nieporent, who is also an owner of Montrachet, had to go to
Aspen, Colo., and Australia, so the scene was shot while he was
away. ``I was replaced by an English actor, Andrew Seear, who
weighs about a third of what I weigh,'' Nieporent said. ``It was
originally Falstaffian or Orson Wellesean. It became English.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nieporent managed to stay in the film. He became a critic
for a fictional food magazine that sounds a lot like Gourmet,
holding court on a set that looks a lot like the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't flub my lines at all,'' he said, ``which I found
amazing.'' How hard was it to go from being a restaurateur to
playing a restaurant critic? ``I had to have this sort of, what's
the word, huge confidence about what I was saying,'' he said. ``I
had to feel very big.''
</P>
<P>
   The bubble burst when he returned to the TriBeCa Grill. ``Harvey
Weinstein was holding court with Quentin Tarantino,'' Nieporent
said. ``I thought this was my lucky break, that I'd get cast in the
next one.'' But no.
</P>
<P>
   Good-Will Gospel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Queen Esther Marrow and her Harlem Gospel Singers are
scheduled to leave this weekend to appear at the Montreal Jazz
Fest. They will be the first gospel group to be featured performers
at the Montreal festival.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of reception does Ms. Marrow, who performed with
Duke Ellington and appeared in ``The Wiz'' on Broadway, expect in
Canada, which just convened a 19-nation conference on how the world
is being overrun by American culture?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know; you can't know,'' she said. ``This is
Afro-American culture, but it's spiritual, it's happiness, it's
good news, it's all the things that are good. It doesn't matter
whether you are American or Japanese or whatever, if it makes you
feel good, I would think they would want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics Intrudes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ East met West the other night at a show of Indian
fashions in an unlikely setting, the staid Metropolitan Club, at
Fifth Avenue and 60th Street. The hosts, who included Ismail
Merchant, Georgette Mosbacher and Mary McFadden, had brought
together designers from the subcontinent, who had put together a
collection of outfits that mixed the silks and cottons of the East
with the Audrey Hepburn-in-Paris look of the West.
</P>
<P>
   But nuclear politics hovered over the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things weigh on your mind, even at a beautiful event
like this,'' said the Indian Ambassador to the United States,
Naresh Chandra. Merchant said that designing and exporting clothes
were ``much better than a bomb'' and called the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan in May ``such a backward step.''
</P>
<P>
   A Familiar Scene
</P>
<P>
   There is talk in London that Madonna, who has earned millions
from songs, videos or books that shock as much as they entertain,
is making a video that has something to do with the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales. The Daily Mirror in London said that Madonna was
filmed wading into what appeared to be a pack of paparazzi the
other day. But The Mirror said that the crowd was made up of extras
who had been outfitted with cameras for a scene similar to one
captured by security cameras at the Ritz in Paris, where Diana and
Dodi Fayed stopped before their final, fatal ride together.
Madonna's spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, did not return calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Between Poses
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is how two models with more or less the same
first name spent the same evening: Christy Turlington took her
84-year-old grandmother, Maria, to ``Cabaret'' and had a long
dressing-room chat with one of the stars, Alan Cumming. Christie
Brinkley had a baby girl Thursday. Her spokeswoman would not say
where the girl, Sailor Lee Brinkley Cook, was born, only that she
weighed 7 pounds, 12 ounces. The father, Ms. Brinkley's husband, is
Peter Cook, an architect.

DUCHESNE RETURNS TO KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the St. Louis Blues' 1997-98 media guide,
defenseman Steve Duchesne's biography includes the entry:
</P>
<P>
   ``Favorite NHL city: Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that explains why it didn't take the Los Angeles Kings a
lot of arm twisting to get the 33-year-old free-agent back with the
franchise with which he spent five very productive seasons in the
late 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two days after free agents were allowed to talk to
other teams, the Kings announced Thursday a three-year deal with
Duchesne that also gives him the option of returning for a fourth
season.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed, but it will likely be about
a half-million more than the $2 million that Duchesne made last
season, which tied him for 18th among NHL defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a difficult decision at all,'' said Duchesne, the
NHL's fourth-best scoring defenseman last season with 56 points (14
goals, 42 assists). ``The Kings were definitely a team that wanted
me, and I was excited they were interested. They made a good offer
right off the bat. I wanted to come back to L.A. It's as simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne, a three-time NHL All-Star (twice with the Kings) who
says he now wants to end his career in L.A., led Kings defensemen
in scoring five straight seasons and was on the NHL ALL-Rookie team
in '86-87. The 6-foot, 198-pounder set the Kings' record for goals
by a defensemen with 25 during the '88-'89 season.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 21-goal season in '90-'91, but after the Kings were
eliminated from the playoffs in the second round, then-general
manager Rogie Vachon traded him to Philadelphia in a deal that
eventually brought Jari Kurri to the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Current GM Dave Taylor and coach Larry Robinson, both of whom
played with Duchesne in L.A., made this acquisition a priority
after the team finished 15th in the power play a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding Steve makes our defense as good as any in the NHL,''
said Taylor, ``and on the power play, Steve and (Rob) Blake
together on the point should improve us tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Robinson: ``If you take the 29 points he had on the power
play last season and put them on our club, we end up first in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have loved to have him last year. I think it bodes
well for this team that he says he wants to play here. We've worked
hard to get to where we are. I think he's fortunate to come in at
this time to be part of a great thing that's going to happen for a
long time.''

JUDGE BARS PATAKI'S PLAN FOR EQUAL REFUNDS TO LILCO CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ A federal judge Thursday struck down as
unconstitutional a crucial part of Gov. George Pataki's formula for
refund checks he wants to send to the 1 million customers of the
defunct Long Island Lighting Co.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, Pataki administration officials said they
intended to make the refunds anyway, using their own calculation.
The checks are expected to be mailed in September.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed refunds stem from the state's takeover of LILCO's
electricity service on May 28. Customers immediately saw an average
20 percent cut in bills. The governor's plan also calls for issuing
refunds totaling $101 per customer in Suffolk County and $232 in
Nassau County and the Rockaways in Queens. To help finance those
refunds, $82 of each check was supposed to come from the remaining
money LILCO owed customers to settle a 1987 racketeering lawsuit
that accused LILCO of fraud in its handling of the abandoned
nuclear power plant at Shoreham.
</P>
<P>
   But in a decision in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on
Thursday, Judge Jack Weinstein ruled that payment of the settlement
money must continue under the original formula, which is based on
electricity use. That would funnel more of the refund money to
businesses and institutions that are big consumers of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's plan of fixed refunds regardless of use was intended to
maximize checks to residential customers. Critics have accused him
of manipulating the racketeering-suit money, which was already owed
to customers, in a political scheme to sway Long Island voters just
weeks before he stands for re-election in November. He has denied
such a political motive, saying his plan helps people more.
</P>
<P>
   To show the drastic difference between the two methods,
Weinstein noted that various federal agencies in the LILCO
territory would qualify for only $17,000 in refunds under Pataki's
method, but under the use-based method they would get $441,000. How
much the judge's ruling might reduce the typical resident's refund
check was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki's top aide on the LILCO issue said that the state
would go ahead and issue the checks at the promised amounts.
``Regardless of what the judge has decided,'' said Richard Kessel,
the governor's appointee as chairman of the Long Island Power
Authority, the agency that took over the LILCO system, ``we have
delivered on the 20 percent rate cuts, and we will issue the
rebates of $101 and $232, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel declined to say whether the state would appeal the court
decision. He also declined to specify how the checks would be
financed in the face of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The suit originated in 1987 when Suffolk County officials sued
LILCO over the Shoreham plant under the Racketeer Influenced and
Court Organizations Act. To settle the suit, LILCO agreed to refund
$390 million to customers through bill reductions stretching to the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The power authority had asked the court to modify how the
remaining $110 million would be paid by speeding the timing to this
fall, reducing the amount by 6 percent and allocating it equally to
each customer. The judge rejected the reduction and the equal
payments, saying that the plan would violate the Constitution's
equal protection, contract and due process clauses.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki plan would mean that customers ``who are to receive
the greatest compensation under the settlement would be relegated
to collecting only a fraction of what is due to them,'' Weinstein
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The applicants' proposed radical and major restructuring,'' he
wrote, ``would violate the 14th Amendment's protection against
uncompensated takings of private property by a government entity _
here LIPA.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``LIPA may not now reallocate some class members'
shares of the judgment to others simply because it prefers that
someone else receive the money. The framers of the Constitution
considered such methods of expropriation without compensation
beyond the legitimate scope of government action.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the power authority's ``arbitrary assessment that
residential ratepayers are more worthy of its generosity than are
large commercial and governmental ratepayers cannot pass
constitutional muster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Advisory Panel, a LILCO watchdog group created by
the court as an outgrowth of the racketeering suit, opposed the
power authority's plans. The group's director, Gordian Raacke,
said, ``The court clearly found that LIPA and LILCO were jointly
attempting to rob ratepayers of monies that are due to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Raacke also criticized the state's plans to issue the refund
checks as planned. ``This is a slap in the face of the judge,'' he
said. ``It's a blatant attempt to bribe ratepayers _ with their own
money _ into believing that the bailout of LILCO is in their best
interest and to re-elect Governor Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office deferred comment to Kessel, who said that
the Citizens Advisory Panel was ``working against the citizens.''

CNN RETRACTS REPORT THAT U.S. USED NERVE GAS IN LAOS IN 1970 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 10th graf for additional details on Peter Arnett's
background, quote by Floyd Abrams)  (ps) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN AND FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable News Network executives Thursday retracted the network's
report that the U.S. military had used lethal sarin nerve gas in a
secret 1970 mission in Laos aimed at killing American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The retraction, broadcast Thursday afternoon and accompanied by
an apology, was based on an independent investigation, performed at
CNN's request, that showed the report's conclusions were not
supported by the evidence. The original broadcast, which was
accompanied by the fanfare of advance publicity common in the
growing community of broadcast news magazines, was shown June 7 as
the feature presentation on the first installment of the news
magazine show ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP;Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast, a joint venture with Time magazine that was being
hailed within the Time-Warner empire as the fruit of productive
synergy between the company's disparate news-gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The apology amounted to a devastating admission that the report
had falsely cast the U.S. government, and in particular its
military and intelligence arms, as brazenly using and concealing
the use of one of the most forbidden weapons in the modern arsenal,
a nerve gas banned by numerous international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the piece was broadcast, a slightly modified version
of the account of a mission that was code-named Operation Tailwind
was published in Time, which also made a retraction and an apology
Thursday. Journalists at Time and CNN said Thursday that the story
was broadcast and published despite reservations raised by
journalists within both organizations who received a last-minute
chance to examine the report.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive with the network confirmed Thursday that
Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and perhaps the
network's most prominent correspondent, had been reprimanded for
his work on the story.
</P>
<P>
   April Oliver and her colleague Jack Smith, the producers who had
led the eight-month reporting effort, refused to resign and were
fired. Pamela Hill, the executive producer, and who made the basic
decision to broadcast the report, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that CNN alone was responsible for the erroneous report,
CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson issued a statement Thursday
saying, ``We acknowledge serious faults in the use of sources who
provided NewsStand with the original reports and therefore retract
the Tailwind story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at Time for
this mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Time's article appeared under the bylines of Ms. Oliver and
Arnett, whose career has taken him from Vietnam in the early 1960s
to Bagh- dad in the Persian Gulf war. A Time editor reviewed the
article and ac- cepted its basic thrust. The investigation of the
broadcast, conducted by the noted constitutional lawyer Floyd
Abrams, offered a microscopic examination of how journalism can go
awry. ``The CNN broadcast was not fair,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It showed no fabrication or illegality, but a more subtle
process of distortion that began when conclusions outstripped the
evidence, continued when sources were encouraged to believe that
unseen evidence proved their own suspicions to be true and was
compounded by interviews laced with hypothetical questions and
ambiguous answers. Ultimately, the report concluded, the
journalists refused to give more than a glancing nod to a series of
eyewitnesses' denials that sarin gas was have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CNN journalists involved in this project believed in every
word they wrote,'' according to the Abrams report. ``If anything,
the serious flaws in the broadcast that we identify in this report
may stem from the depths of those beliefs and the degree to which
the journalists discounted contrary information they received
precisely because they were so firmly persuaded that what they were
broadcasting was true.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as her work was being repudiated, Ms. Oliver, the
producer, refused to back away from her conclusions. ``I feel that
this report was solid,'' said Ms. Oliver, 36, ``that I made every
step any journalist would take to ensure its accuracy and that I
had the full backing of management all the way up to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Abrams said he had
enlisted former intelligence officers from the investigative firm
of Jules Kroll to try to independently confirm the account through
their own military, intelligence and diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
   The account of the Abrams investigation, which was posted on
CNN's site on the World Wide Web (www.cnn.com), included numerous
instances of overreaching in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, his report examines the five underpinnings of
the broadcast _ including interviews with participants, information
from nerve gas experts, confidential sources with knowledge of U.S.
intelligence operations, a retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff _ and finds flaws in every one.
</P>
<P>
   The most-cited source, Admiral Thomas Moorer, who was chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from mid-1970 to mid-1974, is 87,
lives in an assisted-care retirement home in Maryland, and is no
longer relied on by CNN's military correspondents. And many of the
answers he gave were to hypothetical questions.

</P>
<P>
   The accounts of those on the scene, where a special forces
commando unit had attacked a base camp and then called for support
from backup airborne units, are dramatic. Particularly dramatic are
accounts that the backup fixed-wing planes dropped gas to help the
U.S. unit escape.
</P>
<P>
   But, as one of the pilots of the aircraft said Thursday, when
the CNN journalists interviewed him, ``I mostly got nerve-gas
questions and I gave tear-gas answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Art Bishop, now a retired satellite engineer, made a
brief journal entry the day after the 1970 engagement saying his
craft had been armed with cluster bomb units that carried r tear
gas and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   In his conference call, Abrams said that a separate document the
journalists relied on was ``a bad Xerox.'' It contained a virtually
illegible reference to a substance used in cluster bombs coded as
``25'' (the code for explosives). The journalist read the illegible
number as ``15,'' the code for nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the Abrams report pointed out, one member of a
reconnaissance unit on the ground near the action, Jay Graves,
``was an important on-the-ground source of information for both the
use of sarin gas and the presence of American defectors.'' The
broadcast quoted Graves as saying ``We saw some round-eyed people.
We didn't know if they were prisoners or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graves' qualifying statement _ ``I didn't see any of them''
_ was not used in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Oliver, the show's senior producer, Smith, said
Thursday that he stood by the story.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Reuters, Arnett said ``Looking at it in
retrospect, maybe I could have asked more questions about the story
than I did. But I came into it very late, after I had spent several
months covering the latest crisis in Baghdad, and by the time I got
there the direction of the story was already set.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last days before the broadcast, people in Time magazine's
New York and Washington bureaus were raising concerns about the
piece, according to several Time journalists. In particular, Mark
Thompson, the magazine's Pentagon correspondent, said he doubted
the truth of the article's allegations. ``He thought it was
unsupportable,'' said one correspondent who insisted on anonymity.
``The entire bureau was worried about it.'' Thompson was on
vacation Thursday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people at Time, Thompson and the Washington
bureau's deputy bureau chief, J.F.O. McAllister, made their
reservations known to editors in New York on June 5, the Friday
before the magazine's Monday release.
</P>
<P>
   According to one editor who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Time responded to these reservations by toning down the piece
somewhat _ putting a question mark in the headline, for example;
writing in the subhead: ``A CNN investigation charges that...''.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson, Time's managing editor, declined to elaborate on a
statement he issued Thursday, which said, ``Based on our own
investigation and that conducted by CNN, we have concluded that the
facts simply do not support the allegations that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Time article was edited by John F. Stacks, an executive
editor, and Johanna McGeary, Time's senior foreign correspondent _
both of whom did not return calls seeking comment. It was also
overseen by Joelle Attinger, an executive editor at Time Inc. who
serves as Time magazine's liaison with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' Ms. Attinger said Thursday. ``I think we
all take responsibility for it _ anybody involved in any aspect of
it must.''
</P>
<P>
   People at Time say the magazine relied on the 156-page summary
that Ms. Oliver had prepared that detailed her sources, a summary
that Abrams criticized in his report as selective and slanted.
</P>
<P>
   At no time, several people at Time said, did anyone question Ms.
Oliver's material as insufficient or suspect, nor did anyone argue
that the article should not run. Moreover, people at Time said
there was no overt pressure from CNN to publish the article.
</P>
<P>
   But one correspondent said the timing of CNN's broadcast of the
gas story _which ran that Sunday _ was such that Time felt
compelled to publish the article. ``Normally, on a Friday, if there
are serious questions about a story, you can always hold it,'' said
one Time correspondent who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time has been working with CNN on polls and on the news
magazine program ``Impact,'' the gas story was the magazine's first
collaboration in the magazine. Despite its potentially damaging
results, Isaacson said in his statement that Time looks forward
``to continuing to collaborate'' with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc.
said the company stood by its alliance with CNN. ``It doesn't cause
me to rethink the teamwork with TV,'' he said. ``All of us
obviously learned some things here and I'm sure as the weeks go on
we'll have discussions about what are the appropriate procedures in
any kind of joint venture.''

WARNING SIGNS OF CHILD ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four youngsters in Brooklyn who the police say
were raped and sodomized by relatives did not appear at a medical
clinic with symptoms of venereal disease. Nor did the children, who
were under the supervision of the city's child welfare agency,
immediately tell their caseworker of their long ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   So how are social workers, foster parents, neighbors,
schoolteachers or medical professionals to know that a child is a
victim of sexual abuse _ the rarest form of abuse endured by youths
in the United States and one that children generally cannot narrate
clearly and believably?
</P>
<P>
   Pinpointing sexual abuse is rarely a simple matter, except in
the odd cases when a child is found to have injured genitals or a
sexually transmitted disease. But advocates for children have tried
to codify the telltale signs of sexual abuse in a 12-page pamphlet
distributed to city social workers, Board of Education employees,
foster parents and others.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Child Abuse Alert: A Desk Reference,'' it is intended
to guide adults in the dicey matter of deciding whether to make an
abuse complaint to the state emergency phone line. It is also meant
to help those mandated by law to report any suspicion of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The checklist is divided into physical and behavioral signs in
the child and behavioral and biographical signs in the adult
caregiver. What follows are some of the most obvious indicators in
children:
</P>
<P>
   _ A child who has difficulty walking, sitting or going to the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ A child with bruises or bleeding in the genital or anal area
or with venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ A child with extreme interest in sexual organs: his or her
own, other children's or parents'.
</P>
<P>
   _ A child who behaves seductively or promiscuously.
</P>
<P>
   _ A child who is overly suspicious or watchful and who either
avoids or inappropriately invites physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Linda Cahill, the medical director of the child
protection center at Montefiore Medical Center, the best of these
gauges are the ones that indicate sexual knowledge beyond a child's
age.
</P>
<P>
   When interviewing the adult, Dr. Cahill said, the most revealing
information is historical: whether the adult was abused as a child
or has a prior record of sexual offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines on adults mention those factors and also the
following behaviors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hypervigilance or repressive attitudes about sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking a child to many medical centers rather than remaining
with one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acting as if the child is much older or much younger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Isolating the child from social contact.
</P>
<P>
   There are other symptoms listed in the guidebook, but they are
also common to a variety of problems. Among them, in the child, are
regressive behavior, withdrawing into fantasy or performing poorly
in school. In the parent, professionals are urged to be wary of
substance abuse, divorce, a family history of mental illness, or
social isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these are a direct correlation,'' said Nanete
Schrandt, head of the juvenile social work division of the Legal
Aid Society. ``It's not like if there are five of these, you know.
But it gives you a better picture. These are the red flags.''

FRISK ME NOW AMONG NINE SET TO MEET IN THE SUBURBAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Racing here will fire its customary Fourth of
July flare Saturday when Belmont Park runs the final race in its
``handicap triple,'' the $350,000 Suburban at a mile and
one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Suburban will not involve world-class stars
like Skip Away or Gentlemen, it will feature the best of the next
rank of senior horses, notably the first four finishers in the
Brooklyn Handicap three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nine horses were entered in the Suburban on Thursday, with the
high weight a surprisingly low 118 pounds assigned to Frisk Me Now,
who ran fourth when the handicap series was started May 25 with the
Metropolitan Mile.
</P>
<P>
   He skipped the Brooklyn on June 13, but will be facing the first
four from that race: Subordination, Sir Bear, Mr. Sinatra and
Accelerator. And Subordination, who led all the way to win the Fort
Marcy in May and the Brooklyn in June, figures to go to the post as
the favorite in the Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concerns for the Suburban,'' said Gary Sciacca, who
trains Subordination, ``are that we are going to be on the lead and
we'll be going an extra eighth of a mile. But my horse has speed
and, because he has speed, that always makes him dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suburban will be joined on the holiday program by two other
stakes: the $75,000 Poker Handicap at one mile on the turf and the
$75,000 Tremont for 2-year-olds at five and a half furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   But Belmont Park will be staging six stakes during the three-day
weekend, beginning today with the $100,000 Prioress for 3-year-old
fillies at six furlongs and the $75,000 Astoria for 2-year-old
fillies at five and a half furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend closes Sunday with the $150,000 Tom Fool Handicap at
seven furlongs.  &QL;

JURY REACHES MIXED VERDICT ON FRAUD TRIAL OF FREEMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to make it 40-count indictment, not 41) (sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILLINGS, Mont. _ A federal jury on Thursday convicted the
leadership of the anti-government Freemen movement of a series of
charges, largely financial fraud, but was unable to reach verdicts
on several other counts including the conspiracy charge that is at
the core of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Coughenour of U.S. District Court here refused to
declare a mistrial on the 11 deadlocked counts of the 40-count
indictment and ordered the jury to return to the courthouse on
Tuesday to resume deliberation of the undecided counts. The jury
also found three of the defendants not guilty on two charges each.
</P>
<P>
   Capping four days of deliberations, the jury also convicted
LeRoy Schweitzer, portrayed by prosecutors as the mastermind of the
group, Daniel Peterson, the group's treasurer, and Richard Clark of
two counts of threatening to kill Montana's chief federal judge,
Jack Shanstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer was convicted on 21 counts involving phony financial
instruments. The jury found Peterson guilty on four fraud-related
counts, Russell Landers on three, Dale Jacobi and Rodney Skurdal on
two each, and Clark on one.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charge that the Freemen wrote 3,432 ``checks,'' with
a total face value of $15.5 billion, using the number of a Norwest
Bank account that never contained more than $116.
</P>
<P>
   With 92 witnesses and five weeks of testimony, the trial offered
glimpses into the Freemen's secretive world of financial fraud and
violence. A radical anti-government group with racist elements, the
Freemen caught the nation's attention in the spring of 1996 during
an 81-day FBI siege of their ranch compound in Jordan, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed after two years in jail, nine of the defendants
boycotted the trial, refusing even to talk to their lawyers, and
seven of them have spent the last two weeks in a prison hospital in
Springfield, Mo., following two hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   John McGuire, the only defendant to testify at the trial, argued
that the federal court had no jurisdiction over him and that he had
not committed any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for other defendants argued that their clients sincerely
believed that the phony checks printed by Freemen on home computers
were genuine. They charged that the FBI falsely encouraged the
Freemen when an undercover agent told them he cashed their checks
and used the money to buy a copier, computer and radio system for
the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The two women defendants, Agnes Stanton and Cherlyn Petersen,
attended the trial. Their lawyers used what one lawyer called the
``gofer defense,'' alleging that they were merely following their
husbands' instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the prosecution testimony tried to prove that the
Freemen's central activity in Jordan was to try to pass bogus
financial instruments as real.
</P>
<P>
   Printed from a home computer, these ``checks'' carried
impressive sounding names: ``documentary draft,'' ``lien draft,''
``comptroller warrant, ``certified money order,'' and ``certified
banker's check.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``checks'' went out to 1,004 recipients in about half the
states of the nation, investigators said. The problem was so severe
that the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency issued four worldwide
alerts to the financial community from October 1994 until the FBI
placed the Freemen compound under siege in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worthless junk'' was how Judge Coughenour described the
checks. He warned defense lawyers not to portray the checks as
genuine, adding they could say only that the defendants believed
them to be genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Even though less than 1 percent of their checks were honored,
the Freemen managed to accumulate a small fortune; $144,000 in
cash, plus a small hoard of money orders and gold and silver coins.
</P>
<P>
   Stored in a small wooden box, the cash and coins were smuggled
out of the compound in the early days of the siege, testified Ebert
Stanton, a former Freeman, whose parents, Agnes and William, were
on trial here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that the trial would draw crowds of right-wingers,
fewer than a dozen supporters appeared here during the trial. In
late May, several men came here from the Pacific Northwest in
response to an Internet appeal for militia members to ``intercede''
in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   One Freeman supporter, Jacob Miller of Florida, was expelled
from the courtroom for studying the jury with binoculars, and one
death threat against the judge was reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An FBI firearms examiner testified that the Freemen's arsenal in
Jordan held 23 handguns, 67 rifles, 10 shotguns and more than
40,000 rounds of ammunition, including 182 rounds of armor-piercing
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   A series of witnesses testified that they threatened to kidnap,
put on trial and execute a host of local officials. Witnesses said
the Freemen also offered $1 million bounties for the capture or
death of the lead FBI investigator and a federal judge who had
issued a foreclosure order against a farm owned by two of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Canady, the lead FBI agent in the case, testified that
fear of provoking bloodshed prevented the bureau from arresting the
Freemen when they shifted operations from Roundup, Mont., to Jordan
in September 1995. In addition, the FBI seems to have used the
Freemen as bait to amass intelligence information on the militia
movement during a yearlong surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The delay not only caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in
fraud losses to businesses victimized by Freemen checks but also
caused deep resentment among the Freemen's rural neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the June 2 Republican primaries, voters in Garfield and
Musselshell Counties rejected their sheriffs, men who had become
associated with the go-slow policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hands were tied to working with the FBI,'' said Charles
Phipps, the Garfield County sheriff who plans to run as a write-in
candidate in November. ``We could have gone out, got in a gun
fight, shot somebody, then be in lawsuits for the rest of our
lives. People didn't understand that.'' &QL;

HERBERT HAUFRECHT, 88, PIANIST, COMPOSER, FOLKLORIST

<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbert Haufrecht, a composer, pianist, folklorist and music
editor, died June 23 at the Albany Medical Center. He was 88 and
lived in Shady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Haufrecht was born in New York City and studied at the Cleveland
Institute of Music, where his teachers included the composers
Herbert Elwell and Quincy Porter, and at the Juilliard School,
where he studied composition with Rubin Goldmark. He also studied
piano with Severin Eisenberger and chamber music with Arthur
Loesser.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he completed his studies, he was hired as a field
representative in West Virginia for the Resettlement Administration
of the U.S. Agriculture Department. During his four years there, he
collected folk songs and stories, organized square dances and began
an oral history project that occupied him for nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   He developed educational materials based on folk music and wrote
several publications, including ``Folk Songs in Settings by Master
Composers'' (1970) and ``Folk Songs of the Catskills'' (1982), a
three-volume work on which he collaborated with Norman Cazden and
Norman Studer.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to New York in 1939, Haufrecht became a staff
composer and arranger for the Federal Theater and composed
incidental scores for several plays. He also organized an annual
Folk Festival of the Catskills, in Phoenicia, N.Y., in 1940 and
composed several stage works for it, including a musical theater
work, ``We've Come From the City,'' and a folk opera, ``Boney
Quillen.'' He worked with several folk singers, including Pete
Seeger, Burl Ives, the Weavers and, in the 1960s, Judy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Haufrecht's symphonic music reflected his folk interests, as
well as an interest in jazz. Among his works are a set of
``Fantastic Marches,'' which were given their premiere by Leopold
Stokowski on an NBC Symphony broadcast in 1939; a Symphony for
Brass and Timpani; ``Blues and Fugue'' for viola; two string
quartets, and several children's works. His final work was a
setting of Mark Twain's ``War Prayer,'' which had its premiere in
Kingston, N.Y., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Betty; two daughters, Marsha
Haufrecht and Joy Lugo; a son, William Robert Haufrecht, and two
grandchildren.

KNICKS PURSUE UPFRONT PAYMENT FOR SEASON SEATS DESPITE LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Malmud, a New York lawyer, said he was shocked
when he received the renewal notice for his three New York Knicks
season tickets. He was angry that, despite a lockout of the players
by the club owners, threatening the start of the season, the Knicks
have raised ticket prices for their 43 home games in Madison Square
Garden and want full payment upfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to retain your seats,'' he said, ``you don't have
a choice. They have you by the seat. I have season seats for the
Mets and Yankees, and when they had labor trouble in 1994, they
took token deposits for 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks have ample opportunity for people who haven't sent
in their money to delay the process. I would have no objection to
sending in a nominal amount. And the Knicks keep the interest on
your deposit no matter when the season starts. You don't go broke
from small profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weiller, a Knicks spokesman, said the renewal bills were
mailed over the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last year full payment was required by Aug. 13. This year's
bills told season-ticket buyers they could pay the full amount by
July 13, or half by then and the other half by Aug. 17. The bills
also warned, ``If payment is not received by the due date, your
account will be canceled with no further reminders from MSG.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiller said the due dates would not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working under the assumption that we will have a season
as planned,'' he said. ``If games are lost due to the lockout,
appropriate refunds will be provided. If the lockout is going to
change our plans, the determination hasn't been made.''
</P>
<P>
   About 16,000 of the 19,763 seats available for Knicks home games
are bought by season subscribers. The bills to season ticketholders
were accompanied by a letter from Dave Checketts, the president of
the Garden, who said ticket prices were being raised because of the
increased cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The increases range from 8 to 13 percent. The best seats in the
house, the courtside row where Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, John
McEnroe and other celebrities sit, have the highest increase in
dollars ($1,250 a seat last season, $1,350 this season), but the
lowest in percentage.

   Schweitzer was convicted on 21 counts involving phony financial
instruments. The jury found Peterson guilty on four fraud-related
counts, Russell Landers on three, Dale Jacobi and Rodney Skurdal on
two each, and Clark on one.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charge that the Freemen wrote 3,432 ``checks,'' with
a total face value of $15.5 billion, using the number of a Norwest
Bank account that never contained more than $116.
</P>
<P>
   With 92 witnesses and five weeks of testimony, the trial offered
glimpses into the Freemen's secretive world of financial fraud and
violence. A radical anti-government group with racist elements, the
Freemen caught the nation's attention in the spring of 1996 during
an 81-day FBI siege of their ranch compound in Jordan, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed after two years in jail, nine of the defendants
boycotted the trial, refusing even to talk to their lawyers, and
seven of them have spent the last two weeks in a prison hospital in
Springfield, Mo., following two hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   John McGuire, the only defendant to testify at the trial, argued
that the federal court had no jurisdiction over him and that he had
not committed any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for other defendants argued that their clients sincerely
believed that the phony checks printed by Freemen on home computers
were genuine.

BATBOY PAID A PRICE DURING ORIOLES-YANKEES BRAWL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 2-inch fish hook cut across Joe Rocchio's
forehead is six weeks old. The pink gash might fade, but a plastic
surgeon told the batboy that it would not disappear. Guess what?
Tino Martinez was not the only casualty in the brawl between the
Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends told me I got a story for life,'' Rocchio said.
``When I'm a grandfather, I can use this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was definitely an unforgettable night, one that Rocchio will
be thinking of when the Orioles return Friday night to the visiting
clubhouse at Yankee Stadium for the first time since that series.
Rocchio, 19, said that May evening was almost as unforgettable as
being the ball boy in left field when third baseman Charlie Hayes
caught a popup for the final out of the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Rocchio is conscientious, so when he saw Baltimore reliever
Armando Benitez nail Martinez with a pitch between the shoulder
blades and saw the players fill the field, he left his duties in
the Oriole clubhouse for the Baltimore dugout. Get the bats, get
the helmets and get out of the way, Rocchio told himself.
</P>
<P>
   As Rocchio flung pieces of equipment up the runway so the
players would not trip, a tangle of arms and legs moved closer and
closer to him. Rocchio saw Alan Mills punch Darryl Strawberry and
saw Strawberry lunge at Mills. He was worried. Rocchio reached for
some more bats and helmets, but a security guard who was trying to
clear the dugout tossed him aside. Rocchio landed on the concrete
steps, face first.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Hershon, the Yankees' physician, told Rocchio he
needed stitches. Hershon gave Rocchio the choice of closing the
wound at the Stadium or going to a hospital for it.
</P>
<P>
   After Rocchio received five stitches, he turned into the
Invisible Man. He dodged the eyes of the Orioles and reporters, not
wanting to answer queries about being injured.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's Suspension Upheld
</P>
<P>
   Gene Budig, the American League president, declined Thursday to
reduce the five-game suspension he imposed on Mike Stanton for
hitting the Orioles' Eric Davis with a pitch on June 16. Budig's
decision irked Stanton and Manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's suspension will begin with Friday night's game with
the Orioles. Stanton had appealed the suspension during a hearing
in Budig's Manhattan office on June 26.

 DAVID BRUCE CRATSLEY, PHOTOGRAPHER OF STILL lIFES AND GAY LIFE, (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Bruce Cratsley, a photographer whose subjects
ranged from light-soaked still lifes and portraits of friends to
celebratory documents of gay and lesbian life in New York City,
died June 29 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from AIDS, according to Sarah
Morthland, an art dealer who is an executor of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   Cratsley, who was born in Canton, Pa., and graduated from
Swarthmore College, studied with the photographer Lisette Model at
the New School for Social Research in the early 1970s. Working
under the name Bruce Cratsley, he had shows at numerous New York
galleries, Howard Greenberg, Laurence Miller Gallery and Witkin
among them, and was represented at the time of his death by Yancey
Richardson Gallery in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   A retrospective of Cratsley's photographs (which he referred to
as ``snapshots, really, though carefully made'') was mounted by the
Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1996 to critical acclaim. A monograph on
the artist, titled ``White Light, Silent Shadows,'' was published
by Arena Editions earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   For many years Cratsley documented the annual Gay Pride Parade
in New York, as well as the fashion extravaganza known as Wigstock.
More than a thousand of his pictures of those events are in the
permanent collection of the New York Public Library. His work is
also in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Fogg
Art Museum, Harvard University, and the Bibliotheque National,
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Cratsley is survived by his companion, William Leight of New
York City; his mother, Jane Cratsley, and a brother John, both of
Concord, Mass.

JUMP TO LOSING CLUB HASN'T FAZED MCCRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ohio)  (lh) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until this summer, Washington Mystics guard Nikki
McCray never knew what it was like to play on a losing team.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1995, McCray was 122-11 under Coach Pat Summitt at
Tennessee, a stretch that included a Final Four appearance in the
women's national basketball tournament. After graduating with a
degree in sports marketing, she spent her first year out of college
on the U.S. national team in preparation for the 1996 Olympics.
That team steamrolled to a 60-0 record and a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as a member of the Columbus Quest of the American
Basketball League, McCray led her team to the league's inaugural
championship, in 1997, by averaging 19.9 points per game. Her
slashing, high-scoring style also made her the ABL's most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   But McCray realizes basketball is a business, and in January she
became the first ABL player to jump to the rival Women's National
Basketball Association after its well-publicized first season, in
the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a great position,'' said McCray of her decision to
switch leagues. ``I only had a one-year contract, so it made me
like a free agent. The WNBA had the marketing, the money and the
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   In March the Quest clinched its second consecutive ABL title,
proving there was life after McCray. Four months later McCray, 25,
is still putting up very impressive numbers. She is averaging 19.2
points per game for the Mystics, and is listed among the top 10 in
the WNBA in assists and steals. Instead of being part of a
championship-caliber squad, though, she is a member of an expansion
team with the league's worst record (1-8).
</P>
<P>
   But there is no sign of regrets from McCray. ``I was very happy
for Columbus because nobody expected them to win it again because I
wasn't there,'' McCray said. ``They had very balanced scoring every
game, and when I was there I always led the team in scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   And although McCray is far from content with the way
Washington's season has unfolded, she remains upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the team is very frustrated,'' McCray said. ``We
didn't expect to be 1-8, but at some point it's got to turn around.
But the positive is, we know it and we have the talent to address
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the Mystics are the league's worst team at
taking care of the ball, averaging 23 turnovers per contest. More
unsettling, only three of their eight losses have been by fewer
than 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most painfully obvious sign of the Mystics'
struggles came Monday night against the Houston Comets (8-1).
Against the top team in the WNBA, Washington was held to a
league-record-low 48 points in a 25-point defeat. The Mystics also
set records for turnovers (33) and steals allowed (21).
</P>
<P>
   Being an expansion team is not necessarily an excuse. Detroit,
the WNBA's other first-year franchise, is on a six-game winning
streak and is only a game and a half behind Charlotte in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics will venture into Madison Square Garden Friday night
for a 7:30 p.m. matchup with the Liberty (5-5). Washington does not
have a victory on the road, and New York is looking to bounce back
from an 82-65 loss to Detroit on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams seem to be going in different directions. The
Liberty is starting to come together as it nears next Wednesday's
showdown against Houston while the Mystics are grasping for any
sort of victory to build on in a lost first season.
</P>
<P>
   As the frustration mounts, McCray continues to heed the advice
of Summitt, who is known for keeping in touch with her former
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's told me to stay positive and continue to believe,''
McCray said.

JULIA PERLES, 84, GROUNDBREAKER IN DIVORCE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julia Perles, a longtime Manhattan lawyer who played an
important part in bringing about a significant change in New York
state's divorce law, died July 1 at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in
Sarasota, Fla. She was 84 and had lived in Sarasota for about four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was not immediately clear, but she had had a fall at
her home, said Janet Post, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perles is widely considered to have played the leading role
in bringing about the passage of what is popularly known as New
York state's equitable distribution law, which went into effect in
1980. The law brought about what its admirers have called a
revolutionary change in the practice of matrimonial law and in the
rights of marital partners.
</P>
<P>
   At her death, Ms. Perles was still affiliated with the law firm
of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim &AMP; Ballon, based in Manhattan,
where she became a partner in 1970, having been invited by Louis
Nizer to head the firm's matrimonial practice.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to become a senior partner until about eight years
ago, and remained head of her department until she moved to
Florida. After that, she continued to be affiliated with the firm
and its matrimonial department.
</P>
<P>
   While she was practicing matrimonial law, she became chairwoman
of a special committee of the New York County Lawyers Association.
The panel's members were respected specialists in marital law who
favored getting the equitable-distribution change made in the state
law. Committee members communicated with the state Legislature in
Albany repeatedly, former colleagues of Ms. Perles recalled, and it
took much attention and perseverance to persuade the Legislature to
make the change.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law as it was passed in 1980, both spouses, in the
event of a divorce, are enabled to share equitably in the assets
that either or both of them have accumulated during the marriage,
even if title to the property _ a house for instance, or a business
_ is in the name of only one spouse. Parties to a marriage did not
have that legal right in New York state before the law was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying assumption behind the law is that both parties to
a marriage contribute to the acquisition, maintenance and growth of
the marital assets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perles' clients over the years included Woody Allen; Nancy
Allen, the actress-wife of Brian De Palma, the movie director; the
former Eve Ella Sherpick Green, the first wife of Harry Helmsley,
the New York real estate titan; David Merrick, the producer; and
Ethel Scull, who once was called the doyenne of the pop art world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perles was a former president of the New York Women's Bar
Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial
Lawyers and a member of the Dirty Thirty, an organization of
American lawyers prominent in the field of matrimonial law.
</P>
<P>
   She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and she wanted to be a
lawyer from the time she was 12 years old. Rona Shays, a close
friend, recalled that Ms. Perles used to say that her own mother
had not wanted her to go to law school and had said to her, ``No
one will want to marry you if they think you're smarter than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Perles went on to attend Brooklyn College, and
she received her law degree in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School.
</P>
<P>
   She was an associate in the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz &AMP;
Frohlich from 1942 to 1952 and then a partner at the Manhattan law
firm of Greenbaum Wolff &AMP; Ernst before going to Phillips, Nizer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951 she married Howard Singer. He died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Her survivors include a brother, David Perles, who lives in Boca
Raton, Fla.
