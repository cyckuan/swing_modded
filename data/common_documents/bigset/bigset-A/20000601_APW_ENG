List Targets Top Drug Traffickers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is trying to put the financial
squeeze on the world's biggest drug kingpins, but there are fears innocent
people and businesses could get caught in the wringer. The administration is
required, under legislation approved last year, to provide Congress by Thursday
with a list of what it considers to be the top foreign drug traffickers. Those
on the list -- and their foreign business associates -- would have their U.S.
assets frozen in most cases. Americans would be barred from doing business with
them.

Clinton Asked To Name More Monuments
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt Wednesday asked President
Clinton to declare four new national monuments, including one at the Hanford
nuclear reservation in Washington state that would protect 200,000 acres. The
other three would protect nearly 351,000 acres of federal land in Oregon,
Colorado and Arizona. If Clinton approves the request, as expected, he will have
used the Antiquities Act to protect nearly 3.7 million acres -- the second most
by a U.S. president.

Philly School Takeover Averted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mayor John F. Street announced a plan Wednesday to bail
out the Philadelphia schools, averting a state takeover of the financially
strapped school district -- at least through next year. The state will put up
nearly $70 million through deferred taxes and the city will add $20 million
under the plan, though Street said it was unclear how the city would come up
with its share of the money. The school board approved also about $30 million in
cuts Wednesday, primarily in administrative offices, teacher training programs
and staffing in a comprehensive day-care program.

U.N. Reports on Women's Progress

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an assessment of women's progress toward equality,
the United Nations reported Wednesday that more girls are attending school --
but that all females still confront ''a global epidemic'' of violence. The mixed
snapshot for women five years after a major international women's conference in
Beijing shows they comprise an increasing share of the world's labor force but
are making no headway in cracking the top echelons of business and government.

Official: No Jerusalem Deal Soon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Palestinian official said Wednesday that Israel has
offered to withdraw from more than 90 percent of the West Bank as part of a
peace treaty, but an Israeli official said that deal would not resolve the
status of contested Jerusalem. The two spoke on the eve of a summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Clinton designed to push forward
negotiations over the treaty. The meeting Thursday is in Lisbon, Portugal.

FCC Change Will Lower Phone Bills
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All telephone customers are expected to see savings
beginning with their July long-distance bills under a dramatic overhaul devised
by the industry and adopted by the Federal Communications Commission Wednesday.
People who make few or no long-distance calls could see their bills drop by as
much as 50 percent. The commission cut by $3.2 billion the ''access fees'' that
local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect calls -- costs
that are typically assessed to consumers.

Witnesses Offered Against Microsoft Breakup

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft, filing a last brief before the federal judge

software giant. In an additional ''offer of proof,'' Microsoft's lawyers said
Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks and Michael Kapellas of Compaq, among others,
would testify to the negative effects that a government-backed Microsoft breakup

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Herbert Perry hit a tiebreaking double in the ninth inning
Wednesday, leading the Chicago White Sox over the Seattle Mariners 4-3. Carlos
Lee reached second with one out in the ninth when third baseman John Mabry
allowed the ball to go under his glove for a two-base error. Perry followed with
a ground-rule double to right off Kazuhiro Sazaki. Bob Howry (1-1) pitched 1 2-3
hitless innings and Keith Foulke, Chicago's fifth pitcher, got three outs for
his 10th save. Seattle's Aaron Sele allowed three runs and three hits in 6 1-3
innings.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 13, Tigers 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro homered and drove in four runs as
the Texas Rangers tied the club record for wins in May with a 13-5
victory over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer also had four RBIs as Texas pounded five pitchers
for 16 hits, seven for extra bases, as the Rangers finished May
with an 18-10 record to tie the 1991 and '96 clubs for most wins in
the month.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers star Juan Gonzalez sat out again with a strained
left foot and missed the entire three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers lost two of three in the series, and have won only
two of their last seven.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit a two-run homer in the first and added a two-run
single in the fourth. He was 6-for-13 with two home runs and five
RBIs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Greer hit an RBI fielder's choice in the second, a two-run
single in the fifth and a sacrifice fly in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea hit two doubles, a two-run triple and scored four
times.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver (2-3) struggled through 5 2-3 innings to win for
the second time in three starts. He allowed five runs on eight hits
but was able to strand 10 runners, battling through bases-load
situations in the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki (2-6), who had won his previous two decisions and
had just a 1.71 ERA in his last three starts, lasted only 3 2-3
innings and gave up six runs -- five earned -- on nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit a two-run homer in the first, a high drive that
stayed just fair down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers got one back in their half of the inning when Jose
Macias scored after three straight walks with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki had seemingly escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the
second when Greer hit a grounder to second. But after forcing Royce
Clayton on a toss from Macias at second, shortstop Deivi Cruz's
relay sailed over first base as two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit a two-run single that finished Mlicki in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Greer hit a two-run single and Ivan Rodriguez a two-run double
off Brandon Villafuerte in the fifth to make it 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers got run-scoring singles from Wendell Magee and Robert
Fick in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   After Macias walked and Bobby Higginson hit a double to knock
out Oliver in the sixth, Brad Ausmus greeted Tim Crabtree with a
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rain delayed the start for 45 minutes. ... Palmeiro's home
run was the 376th of his career, moving him into a tie with Carlton
Fisk for 44th on the career list. Palmeiro's 34 career homers
against Detroit are his most against any opponent. ... Higginson
batted .375 (12-for-32) during the Tigers' nine-game homestand. ...
The Tigers have been outhomered 25-15 in 25 games at Comerica Park.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Limit Use of Pesticide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency says one
of the most commonly used pesticides may be more dangerous to
people than previously thought, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   The pesticide chlorpyrifos, sold under the trade names Dursban
and Lorsban, is found in more than 800 products. The EPA's
conclusion, expected to be announced June 8, will effectively
remove the pesticide from all over-the-counter products, the Post
said on its Web site late Wednesday, quoting unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's decision would make the acceptable exposure level of
the pesticide one-tenth of what's currently allowed, the Post said.
Farmers will still be allowed to spray the pesticide on crops, but
its agricultural use will be reduced to a degree not yet decided.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the EPA seeking comment were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The newly estimated hazards of chlorpyrifos are based on
experiments showing the substance can cause brain damage in fetal
rats, not on human studies, the Post said. The EPA concluded that
the compound poses no immediate threat to public health and won't
order a recall of products containing it.
</P>
<P>
   In October a preliminary risk assessment of the pesticide found
it to be so pervasive it potentially could pose health risks to
people, especially children.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorpyrifos is one of the most widely used pesticides, with
between 20 million and 24 million tons applied annually, according
to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Dow AgroSciences of Indianapolis, the pesticide can
be found in everything from pet collars to insecticides applied to
food crops, lawns and gardens. The chemical also is used to kill
termites and indoors as a bug killer in hospitals, homes and
daycare centers.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Test TWA 800 Theory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government investigators fired Stinger
missiles into the air from a Florida beach last month to help
determine if the 1996 explosion and crash of Trans World Airlines
Flight 800 was caused by a missile, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it will take several weeks to analyze data
from the unannounced tests, but initial observations turned up
nothing to challenge the National Transportation Safety Board's
preliminary conclusion that no missile hit the plane, the Post said
on their Web site late Wednesday, quoting unidentified sources
familiar with the tests.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said he could not confirm the
report.
</P>
<P>
   On July 17, 1996 the Boeing 747 exploded and fell into the
Atlantic Ocean off Long Island shortly after its departure from New
York's JFK Airport, killing all 230 people on board. While numerous
witnesses saw streaks of light in the sky, investigators have said
they have no physical evidence of a bomb or missile.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the crash, the board determined that the plane's
nearly empty center fuel tank exploded, but they so far have not
determined a source of ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Board investigators wanted to cover all possibilities by making
a scientific comparison between what witnesses said they saw and
the appearance of a missile in the same atmospheric conditions and
lighting as the evening of the crash, the Post said.

<HEADLINE> Three inmates, four guards injured in prison fire  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERS, Conn. (AP) -- Three inmates, including a man accused of
killing an East Hartford police officer, were injured Wednesday
night in a fire at the Northern Correctional Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The fire occurred at about 7:45 p.m. in a unit of the
maximum-security prison that houses about 50 inmates, including the
six on Connecticut's death row, said Christina Polce, a Correction
Department spokeswoman. No death row inmates were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire had not been determined Wednesday, though
state police said it was reported as a mattress fire.
</P>
<P>
   The injured included Alex Sostre, who is awaiting trial on
capital felony charges in the Jan. 23, 1999 shooting of East
Hartford Police officer Brian Aselton. Sostre suffered smoke
inhalation, but was expected to be returned to the prison, said
Capt. Heather Ziemba, a spokeswoman for the Department of
Correction.
</P>
<P>
   Sostre's cellmate, identified as Pedro Poupart, suffered minor
burns and was expected to remain hospitalized overnight, Ziemba
said. A third inmate, identified as Julio Gomez, suffered minor
smoke inhalation as was being returned to Northern, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Johnson Memorial Hospital in Stafford said four
guards also were treated for smoke inhalation. But prison officials
said the guards were not injured, and went to the hospital only to
accompany the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The housing unit, known as One East, is reserved for inmates
with behavioral problems. Inmates in the unit are locked in their
cells 23 hours a day, Ziemba said. The residents were evacuated to
another section of the prison after the fire, but were being
returned to their cells late Wednesday night, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time was public safety, or the security of the facility
jeopardized,'' Polce said.
</P>
<P>
   The prison houses over 430 of Connecticut's worst offenders.
Polce said the facility's perimeter was ''secured and reinforced''
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The community was notified through a beeper system that
activates in times of emergency, Polce said.

<HEADLINE> Hostages Taken at Luxembourg School  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASSERBILLIG, Luxembourg (AP) -- A man armed with a grenade,
pistol and knife held 29 children and three teachers at a preschool
early Thursday. He had released eight children earlier and demanded
a plane to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven children, none older than 7, were taken hostage in
mid-afternoon Wednesday by the 40-year-old man in Wasserbillig,
near the Germany border.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators eventually persuaded him to release eight of the
children, said Victor Schlentz of the Luxembourg police.
</P>
<P>
   As the standoff entered its second day Thursday, more than 130
police had taken positions around the school, and a dozen German
police were ready to help nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is stable; we are still in contact with the
hostage taker,'' regional police director Joseph Schmit said early
Thursday. ''We are quite confident that the situation will not
escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident has shocked this normally quiet corner of Europe,
where violent crimes are rare. Anxious onlookers gathered near the
barricades around the building, which was surrounded by ambulances,
fire trucks and a growing number of media trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Police have refused to give any details on the hostages'
condition, police tactics or on the kidnapper's motive.
</P>
<P>
   But local residents said the man, a resident of a neighboring
village, apparently blamed the school when he lost custody of his
two children in a separation battle with his wife. His children had
at one time attended the preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the father of two of the child hostages indicated
that they weren't being harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us the kids were sleeping and that they had been
fed,'' said Seraphine Freitas, 40.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his wife were extremely worried. ''We have to get
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight released children were returned to their parents ''in
good condition,'' Schlentz said.
</P>
<P>
   As the incident began, a teacher managed to smuggle six or seven
other children out of the school, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Luxembourg's Interior Minister Michel Wolter
said he would like to see a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to have a plane to leave for Libya. I have given
instructions to use all means necessary to resolve this matter
without the use of violence,'' said Wolter.
</P>
<P>
   Wolter said that the man has had family problems and had a
history of mental illness. Police said he spoke with a psychiatrist
on the scene. Police also said that the hostage-taker is a
Luxembourg citizen but a native of Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Luxembourg, wedged between Belgium, Germany and France, is one
of Europe's smallest countries. Wasserbillig, with a population of
2,300, is located on the Mosselle River, on the German border in
eastern Luxembourg.

<HEADLINE> Annan OK With UN Decision on Israel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Israel's inclusion in a U.N. regional
group will rectify a decades-old anomaly and give Israel ''equal
footing'' in the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision is particularly welcome at a time when all
people of goodwill are hoping for early and decisive progress in
the Middle East peace process,'' Annan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the U.N. regional group of European, North American
and other countries invited Israel to become a temporary member,
with some strings, ending nearly 50 years of Israeli isolation at
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. rules, regional groups decide who fills the 10
rotating seats on the Security Council and other key U.N. committee
assignments. But Arab nations repeatedly blocked Israel's admission
to the regional group where it belonged geographically, making it
the lone country prevented from bidding for committee seats.
</P>
<P>
   The United States lobbied for years to get Israel accepted into
the Western European group, saying it was unfair that Israel had
been banned from participating fully in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Annan said he was pleased that Israel had been
invited to join the European group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should pave the way for Israel to participate on an equal
footing with other nations in the main organs of the United
Nations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys, Ex-Lead Detective Clash  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The parents of slain beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey
have offered to travel to Boulder along with their private
investigators to lay out their theory that a pedophile killed their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey made their offer on ''Larry King Live''
Wednesday during an argument that escalated to shouting and
finger-pointing with Steve Thomas, a former Boulder police
detective who helped lead the investigation into their daughter's
death.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in
the basement of the Ramseys' former home in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's what we've laid on the table,'' John Ramsey said. ''We
have told Chief (Mark) Beckner that we need them to help find this
killer. ... We've had investigators, seasoned investigators,
collectively with over 500 homicides under their belt, who have
been working on this case day in and day out. They have questions,
they have information.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckner sent the Ramseys a letter May 10 asking them to meet
with detectives to discuss new evidence. The couple told Beckner
they were not willing to submit to an ''interrogation.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckner could not be immediately reached by phone for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey lawyer L. Lin Wood said from his Atlanta-area home the
Ramseys' offer has not been formally submitted to Beckner.
</P>
<P>
   John Ramsey also said he plans to sue Thomas over his book,
''JonBenet: Inside the JonBenet Ramsey Murder Investigation,'' in
which Thomas theorizes that Patsy Ramsey killed her daughter. ''A
dead child, your child, was found in your basement and you could
not come up with a satisfactory explanation,'' Thomas told the
Ramseys while defending his book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I had been (arrested) and we would have had a free and
fair trial,'' Patsy Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who now works as a carpenter, resigned in August 1998
and accused the Boulder district attorney of being compromised,
refusing to issue search warrants and refusing to cooperate with
police.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder authorities have said they Ramseys are under ''an
umbrella of suspicion.'' A 13-month grand jury investigation
convened in October without an indictment.

<HEADLINE> Accused Killer Wrote Psychotic Note  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A white supremacist who allegedly killed a
postal worker and shot five people at a Jewish community center
wrote ''a psychotic note'' to himself repeating 129 times that he
should kill another prison inmate, his lawyers said in a legal
document filed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Buford Furrow's attorneys, who are attempting to block the
government from seeking the death penalty in the postman's slaying,
discounted the idea that the note uncovered by jailers was a true
threat on the life of the Latino inmate it named.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the note, defendant had written 129 times, 'You must kill
(Raul) Lopez and all of his protecting angels,''' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, the number 129 was arrived at by ascribing a
numerical value, one through 26, to each letter of the alphabet ...
and adding up the values of the words, 'Lopez' and ''Satan,''' the
document said.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is charged with killing letter carrier Joseph Ileto on
Aug 10, just hours after he allegedly wounded three boys, a
teen-age girl and a woman at the North Valley Jewish Community
Center in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The public defenders representing Furrow said it is unclear from
government filings whether the note was delivered to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow has pleaded innocent, and his team of public defenders
has launched an effort to save him from the death penalty. They
have argued that the federal death penalty statute is
unconstitutional and that the factors presented to justify it in
Furrow's case are too vague.

<HEADLINE> Prison Scraps Telemarketing Program  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT GEHRKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURRAY, Utah (AP) -- The Utah prison system is dropping its
inmate telemarketing center program after an inmate sent three
flirtatious letters, two of them to teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections Executive Director Pete Haun said
Wednesday the prison can't provide enough supervision to guarantee
that inmates don't make inappropriate comments during the phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that no one's safety was compromised in these
matters, but we cannot tolerate situations where the community
feels at risk due to this kind of inappropriate conduct,'' Haun
said.
</P>
<P>
   Disbanding the call center will mean the loss of about 130
inmate jobs, Haun said.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Correctional Industries is a $14 million program designed
to teach inmates job skills by putting them to work doing tasks
such as building furniture, printing state documents and entering
data in computers.
</P>
<P>
   Haun said prison officials have been taking a careful look at
security at the call center for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns were highlighted by three letters sent by inmate
David Hunsaker, one to a 15-year-old girl in Texas, one to a
14-year-old Logan girl, and one to a Logan woman. The letters
offered personal information, then tried to arrange a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The call center will remain open for 90 days so the prison
system can fulfill its contracts with the four entities it handles
calls for. The system has contracts with SandStar Family
Entertainment, Inmark and the Utah Travel Council and Utah
Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates in the program get paid between $5.50 and $7 an hour for
the private contracts, but just 60 to 80 cents per hour on the
state programs.

<HEADLINE> No New Trial for Death-Row Inmate  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A man spared from execution by the
last-minute confession of a traveling companion should not get a
new trial in the killing of a South Carolina Highway Patrol
trooper, a judge said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Charles Johnson, 37, of Morehead City, N.C., avoided
execution in October when his one-time traveling companion Connie
Sue Hess said she was the one who pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Connie Sue Hess will say almost anything, knowing it
to be untrue, for reasons satisfactory to her, but a mystery to the
rest of us,'' Circuit Judge William Keesley wrote. ''Her
understanding of the consequences of her lies is below being
described as childlike.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before Johnson was to die, Hess signed a sworn statement
confessing to the 1985 killing of Trooper Bruce K. Smalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court granted Johnson a stay of execution and
assigned Keesley to review the case and determine the credibility
of Hess, who suffers from a borderline personality disorder and
lives in a supervised apartment complex for the mentally ill in
Norfolk, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers will have a chance to respond to Keesley's
recommendation before the justices determine the next step.
Attorney General Charlie Condon said he would have to wait 15 days
before he could seek to have Johnson's execution rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Richard Charles Johnson has had every benefit of every
doubt,'' Condon said. ''It is now time for justice to be served.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's lawyer, John Blume, did not immediately return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hess' lawyer, Mark Johnson, said he did not anticipate any
criminal charges against his client.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper was shot after pulling over a motor home on I-95
near Hardeeville, near the Georgia line. The .38-caliber revolver
used to kill Smalls was found in a nearby ditch.

<HEADLINE> Jeep Crashes Into Pool Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A sport utility vehicle crashed into a
crowded pool hall near the UCLA campus Wednesday night, killing one
person and injuring at least eight others.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the driver was slumped over the wheel as the
vehicle rear-ended another car at a nearby intersection, then
accelerated rapidly, shoving the car aside, hitting a tree and
roaring over the curb and into the front of Q's Billiard Club.
</P>
<P>
   When the vehicle finally stopped, it was entirely inside the
pool hall's front bar and restaurant area, and the floor was
covered with shattered glass and splintered wood.
</P>
<P>
   A man on the sidewalk outside the pool hall died after the
vehicle hit him, Sgt. Steve Foster said. At least two other men
inside the pool hall were critically injured.
</P>
<P>
   The driver was taken to UCLA Medical Center, where police were
waiting to speak with him, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unknown at this point if he was intoxicated or if there
was a medical condition,'' Foster said. ''It could have been almost
anything. It's hard to say.''

<HEADLINE> Three inmates, injured in prison fire </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERS, Conn. (AP) -- Three inmates, including a man accused of
killing an East Hartford police officer, were injured Wednesday
night in a fire at the Northern Correctional Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The fire occurred at about 7:45 p.m. in a unit of the
maximum-security prison that houses about 50 inmates, including the
six on Connecticut's death row, said Christina Polce, a Correction
Department spokeswoman. No death row inmates were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire had not been determined Wednesday, though
state police said it was reported as a mattress fire.
</P>
<P>
   The injured included Alex Sostre, who is awaiting trial on
capital felony and murder charges in the Jan. 23, 1999 shooting of
East Hartford Police officer Brian Aselton. Sostre suffered smoke
inhalation, but was expected to be returned to the prison
overnight, said Capt. Heather Ziemba, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   Sostre's cellmate, identified as Pedro Poupart, suffered minor
burns and was expected to remain hospitalized overnight, Ziemba
said.
</P>
<P>
   A third inmate, identified as Julio Gomez, suffered minor smoke
inhalation as was being returned to Northern, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Johnson Memorial Hospital in Stafford said four
guards also were treated for smoke inhalation. But prison officials
said the guards were not injured, and went to the hospital only to
accompany the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The housing unit, known as One East, is reserved for inmates
with behavioral problems. Inmates in the unit are locked in their
cells 23 hours a day, Ziemba said. The residents were evacuated to
another section of the prison after the fire, but were being
returned to their cells late Wednesday night, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time was public safety, or the security of the facility
jeopardized,'' Polce said.
</P>
<P>
   The prison houses over 430 of Connecticut's worst offenders.
Polce said the facility's perimeter was ''secured and reinforced''
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The community was notified through a beeper system that
activates in times of emergency, Polce said.

<HEADLINE> Hiding Suspect Crushed in Compacter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A woman suspected of shoplifting was crushed to
death Wednesday when she tried to hide in a garbage compactor after
fleeing security, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Guards at a Value Village store had detained her after
suspecting her of shoplifting, but the woman ran, Officer Glen
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the first place she ran to hide was the compactor,''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said the woman, identified as Gloria Terrell, 43, was
crushed to death after workers who were putting items into the
compactor started the machine. They had been on a break when the
woman apparently went inside the machine and didn't notice she was
there until they restarted it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police told me she stole a pair of shoes,'' Terrell's
mother, Shirley Terrell, told the Detroit Free Press. ''For her to
lose her life for a pair of shoes ... I don't know what to say.''

<HEADLINE> Tripp Wiretapping Case Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's wiretapping case against
Linda Tripp came to an official end Wednesday as a Howard County
judge dismissed the indictment of the central figure in the
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors said last week they would ask Circuit Court
Judge Diane Leasure to dismiss the case because of insufficient
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was indicted last July for illegally taping phone
conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The
tapes were used in the investigation that led to the impeachment of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled in December that only one tape could be used in
the case because of immunity granted to Tripp by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. Then, in May, the judge ruled that most of
Lewinsky's testimony was tainted and inadmissible. That left
prosecutors unable to prove that the call took place before Tripp's
immunity took effect.

<HEADLINE> Bosox Manager Ejected in From Game  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams admitted he
continued to make moves from his office even after he was ejected
from Wednesday night's game against Kansas City -- an apparent
violation of baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was thrown out by first-base umpire Jerry Crawford
during a lengthy argument about fan interference down the
right-field line. After the game, which Boston lost 9-7, Williams
said he had coaches come up the runway into his clubhouse office to
get instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a runway down there and the coaches can walk up
here,'' he said. ''I wasn't down there at all. I'm up here, away
from the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball Rule 4.07 is clear that a manager cannot be in the
dugout, bullpen or field -- or even the stands near the prohibited
areas. But it also says that he must ''take no further part in that
game.''
</P>
<P>
   After Williams was ejected, bench coach Buddy Bailey took over
duties such as pitching changes. But Williams said it was his
decision to take Nomar Garciaparra and Carl Everett out after seven
innings of a 9-2 game to rest them.
</P>
<P>
   The move came back to haunt the team when their spots came up in
the order after Boston cut the deficit to 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I've made a lot of mistakes. I know I'm not perfect.
And maybe I made some after that in the game,'' he said, apparently
unaware that he was admitting to a rule violation.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began when Johnny Damon lined one into the corner
with two outs and runners on first and third. The ball came to a
quick stop as if a fan had touched it, but Crawford ruled that
there was no interference.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez scored from first base; if it had been called a
ground-rule double, he would have had to go back to third. Williams
came out to argue with Crawford and plate umpire Mike Everett,
getting uncharacteristically animated before Crawford threw him
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''He definitely was angry. He had a right to be,'' Garciaparra
said. ''We all were. We all saw the play. I was going over there
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew even angrier, bumping chests and going
nose-to-nose with Crawford before leaving the field to a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was he bumping me? Yeah. But if I bump him back I'm
suspended,'' Williams said. ''Was he baiting me to bump him back?
Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was ejected from Game 4 of last year's AL Championship
Series against the Yankees for arguing with umpire Tim Tschida, who
later admitted blowing the call. That ejection brought out a
hailstorm of garbage onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' last ejection was April 30, when he was automatically
tossed after Pedro Martinez hit a batter in retaliation for an
earlier beanball. He has been thrown out of eight games since
coming to the Red Sox in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ramirez Headed for DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- All-Star right fielder Manny Ramirez, sidelined
with a strained left hamstring muscle became the latest Cleveland
Indians player to go on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also said Wednesday night that left-hander Ricardo
Rincon will have surgery to remove bone spurs in his elbow and
could be out the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland didn't announce the planned move of Ramirez or
Rincon's surgery until after its 7-3 victory over the Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who leads the Indians with 47 RBIs, got hurt while
running out a ground ball during Monday's game against the Chicago
White Sox. He was unavailable the past two games, and will be
officially added to Cleveland's crowded DL on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have eight players -- six pitchers -- on the DL and
have made 23 player transactions since May 18.
</P>
<P>
   To take Ramirez's spot, the Indians will recall right-hander
Jamie Brewington from Triple-A Buffalo. The 28-year-old was 1-0
with a 3.18 ERA in 22 2-3 innings for the Bisons.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon, placed on the DL on May 18, still felt pain in his elbow
while throwing a 60-pitch simulated game on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Charlie it still hurts when I throw my slider,'' Rincon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said Rincon, who received a cortisone shot last week,
said the surgery will be performed by Dr. James Andrews in
Birmingham, Ala. No date has been set for the procedure.

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jeffrey Hammonds hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in
the eighth inning and Todd Helton raised his average to .421 as the
Colorado Rockies beat the Houston Astros 8-6 Wednesday night for a
three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who leads the major leagues in hitting, went 1-for-2 and
walked three times for the second straight game, helping Colorado
overcome a 4-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo, who went 3-for-5 with a homer and three RBIs,
singled off Joe Slusarski (0-3) with one out in the eighth. Helton
grounded into a fielder's choice and Hammonds connected on an 0-2
pitch, sending Colorado on to its fifth consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first three-game sweep of the Astros since Sept.
11-13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White (6-0) pitched a perfect eighth, and Jose Jimenez
finished for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which outhit Colorado 14-12, lost its ninth straight
road game.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Jose Lima, winless since April 5, allowed six
runs and nine hits in six innings. He gave up two more homers,
raising his season total to 22 in 62 innings, yet lowered his ERA
from 8.19 to 8.03.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman went 3-for-4 with a homer and drove in four runs
for the second straight night.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies starter Masato Yoshii, 0-5 with three no decisions since
winning his only game on April 17 at Arizona, allowed five runs and
12 hits in 6 1-3 innings, leaving with a 6-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lima hit an RBI groundout in the second, and Houston made it 4-0
in the third on Berkman's two-run single and Julio Lugo's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado tied it in the bottom half on Cirillo's two-run homer
and Darren Bragg's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo's RBI double put the Rockies ahead 5-4 in the fourth,
and Lansing hit a solo homer in the sixth. Berkman tied it with a
two-run homer in the seventh off Stan Belinda.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston 3B Ken Caminiti rested his left hamstring, strained
running out a sixth inning single on Tuesday. ... The Rockies got a
scare during batting practice when OF Larry Walker was hit on the
right elbow by a liner off the bat of Yoshii. Walker, on the DL
since May 11 with an injured right elbow, collapsed in pain, but
was reported OK moments later after trainers tended to him. .. The
Rockies, who are averaging 40,854 fans at home, reached the million
mark in attendance, with 1,019,742 in 25 home dates.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Latasha Byears had 17 points and eight
rebounds as the Sacramento Monarchs spoiled the Seattle Storm's
WNBA debut with a 76-60 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Byears, playing a reserve role after starting in her first three
seasons in the league, helped Sacramento's backups outscore
Seattle's subs 37-8. Reserves Katy Steding and Stacy Clinesmith
each had 10 points for the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs All-Star guard Ruthie Bolton-Holifield was in uniform,
but did not play because of a strained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Edna Campbell, the No. 2 pick in the expansion draft
who led the league in scoring during the preseason, had 22 points.
Kamila Vodichkova added 20 points and nine rebounds for the Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith, last year's MVP, had 10 points and five
rebounds for Sacramento. Kedra Holland-Corn scored 10 points and
Ticha Penicheiro added nine points and 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   With Vodichkova hitting from the perimeter, the Storm rallied
from a seven-point halftime deficit, tying the game at 46 on an
outside shot by Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento answered right back, with Steding hitting a 3-pointer
and Clinesmith making another to give the Monarchs a 52-46
advantage with 9:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Holland-Corn made three 3-pointers and had 10 points as the
Monarchs overcame an early deficit to take a 36-29 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Fire in Prison Cell Injures Seven  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERS, Conn. (AP) -- A fire in a cell at the state's highest
security prison injured three inmates and four guards Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was in a unit of the Northern Correctional Institution
that houses about 50 inmates, including the six on Connecticut's
death row, said Christina Polce, a Correction Department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   One inmate suffered burns; his roomate, awaiting trial on
capital felony and murder charges in the January shooting of East
Hartford Police officer, suffered smoke inhalation; and a third
inmate suffered smoke inhalation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The four guards were in good condition after being treated for
smoke inhalation, said Lee-Anne Sprague, a spokeswoman for Johnson
Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was quickly extinguished and state police were called
to investigate. The cause of the fire had not been determined
Wednesday, though state police said it was reported as a mattress
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates in the housing unit, known as One East, were moved

<HEADLINE> Helton Lifts Colo. Into Contention  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Terrorizing opposing pitching with a .421 average,
Todd Helton has lifted the Colorado Rockies onto his muscular
shoulders, assuming a leadership role the club has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Since Larry Walker has been sidelined with an injured throwing
elbow, Helton has gone 25-for-51 (.490).
</P>
<P>
   In his last 19 games, he is 32-for-67 (.478) with seven doubles,
seven home runs and 19 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   His .421 average leads the majors by a wide margin, and he also
has 17 homers and 51 RBIs. His .825 slugging percentage trails only
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Helton hit two homers and drove in four runs,
including a walkoff homer in the bottom of the ninth in a 7-6
victory over Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Houston pitchers ignored manager Larry Dierker's
instructions to pitch around Helton, and the first baseman hit two
homers, including the game-winner in the eighth inning in an 8-7
win.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, they listened -- but Helton still hurt them. With
the bases loaded in the eighth, Yorkis Perez pitched carefully to
Helton, walking him on a 3-2 pitch and forcing in the go-ahead run
in Colorado's 10-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Helton walked three times in the game, hitting a double and a
sacrifice fly in his other two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather have walked him all five times,'' Dierker said. ''I
didn't want to walk him with the bases loaded, but one run is less
than we would have done if we threw him one down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Helton walked three more times, going 1-for-2 in
Colorado's 8-6 win.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of respect usually is reserved for established stars
like Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey Jr., but Helton shrugs off any
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they weren't pitching around me on that last
at-bat,'' Helton said Tuesday. ''He threw some pretty tough
pitches, but I've been seeing the ball good, and I was lucky enough
to lay off them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing Walker -- the 1997 NL MVP and two-time defending
NL batting champion -- the Rockies have won 12 of their last 16 to
move within four games of NL West-leading Arizona, reviving hopes
that the Rockies might again be a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other player, Helton is responsible for that
surge.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, 26, doesn't like talking about himself, but others can't
say enough about him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kid is the real deal,'' Rockies manager Buddy Bell said
Wednesday. ''He cares. He gets after it every day. I never doubted
his ability to lead. After meeting him in spring training, I was
impressed. He's a very important guy in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody always knew he could hit. He has the makeup and work
ethic to be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies' first-round selection in the 1995 amateur draft,
Helton was projected to be a line-drive hitter who would ''wear out
the gaps in Coors Field,'' according to then-general manager Bob
Gebhard. He has far exceeded those expectations, especially in
terms of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a special person, a special athlete,'' Rockies hitting
coach Clint Hurdle said. ''And he's a quick learner.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first full season in the majors in 1998, he hit .315 with
25 homers and 97 RBIs. Last year he hit .320 with 35 homers and 113
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, he is on pace to hit 56 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs manager Don Baylor managed the Rockies when Helton
broke into the majors in 1997 and when he finished runnerup in NL
Rookie of the Year voting in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I envisioned him being a .300 hitter, but never one to hit
.400,'' Baylor said during a recent Cubs visit to Coors Field.
''Right now, he reminds me of Don Mattingly. He uses the whole
field.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first got him, I advised our minor-league instructors
not to mess with his swing. I didn't want them to turn him into a
pull hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, a former quarterback at the University of Tennessee,
doesn't go into prolonged slumps. He started the current homestand
0-for-13, then promptly went 13-for-17.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, the left-handed-hitting Helton has
proved he could hit left-handed pitching as well as hit on the
road. This season, he is hitting .392 against lefties. While
hitting .500 at home, he is hitting a respectable .333 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any holes in Helton's game, Dierker smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not very fast,'' he said. ''He is a special hitter right
now. He may not hit as well all year, but the way he is hitting
right now, if you don't have a really sharp pitcher on the mound,
you are better off walking him.''

<HEADLINE> Sparks 69, Starzz 62  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Mwadi Mabika scored a career-high 21
points and Lisa Leslie achieved two milestones as the Los Angeles
Sparks beat the Utah Starzz 69-62 in their WNBA season opener
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie grabbed 11 rebounds, making her the WNBA's career leader
with 810. She scored eight points before fouling out in the final
minute to join Houston's Cynthia Cooper and Phoenix's Jennifer
Gillom as the only players to score more than 1,500 career points.
</P>
<P>
   The game drew 6,112 to the Forum -- the lowest opening-night
attendance in the Sparks' four-year history. The Starzz were
without starting point guard Jennifer Azzi, who fractured her right
hand in a preseason game and will be out for at least another
month.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cooper, an assistant with the Sparks last season who
helped the Los Angeles Lakers win five NBA titles during his
playing career, won his head coaching debut.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 11 points, Utah scored eight straight to close to
64-61 with 3:20 remaining. Natalie Williams, who led the Starzz
with 21 points and 14 rebounds, had five points and Korie Hlede hit
a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   DeLisha Milton answered with a jumper over 7-foot-2 Utah center
Margo Dydek to keep the Sparks ahead 66-61 with two minutes left.
The Sparks hit three free throws in the final minute when the only
basket the Starzz made was a free throw by Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Poor shooting plagued both teams, with neither hitting better
than 34 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Goodson added 14 points for the Starzz, increasing her
Utah record of 27 consecutive games in double figures dating to
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks opened the second half with a 15-2 run to take a
47-36 lead. Mabika and Tamecka Dixon each had six.
</P>
<P>
   Nicky McCrimmon hit two 3-pointers in the next two minutes as
the Sparks increased their lead to 55-41 with 12:23 remaining.

<HEADLINE> Best Scores Playoff Career-High  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Travis Best never stood taller.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers backup point guard, who stands just
5-foot-11, made up for his lack of size with speed. Then once he
got open, hitting shots was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just had to fight and give it everything we had,'' said
Best, who repeatedly sliced through or shot over the New York
defense for a playoff career-high 24 points in an 88-79 victory
Wednesday night in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were fighting hard all year and we didn't want to give it
up this way,'' Best said. ''We didn't want to go down 3-2 and have
to go to New York. So we just came out and fought and we got the
lead and that's all that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers trailed by 18 points early in the second quarter.
First Jalen Rose and then Mark Jackson brought Indiana back.
Finally Best, who had 15 points in the final quarter, put the
Knicks away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tried to be aggressive. I didn't think they could check
me,'' Best said. ''I felt good. In a game that's so important, I
wanted to be aggressive and put up some shots and things went well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great feeling to be one game away from going to the
championship. We're in a good position right now and we want to
take advantage of it. We want to close the series out.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 will be in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, in the conference finals for the fifth time in seven
years, have never been to the NBA Finals. After New York took a
32-17 lead, even the home fans were booing the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's biggest lead was 37-19 before a basket by Rose
started a 23-3 run, and two free throws by Best with six seconds to
go put Indiana ahead 42-40 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers never trailed after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to panic. They jumped on us real good and we
had to respond,'' said Rose, who backed Best with 18 points.
''That's why you've got to stay in there. You can't worry about the
emotions of going up and down. Especially the last two quarters, we
really wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, who had 16 points, gave the bulk of the credit to
Best.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the one that got us into the bonus in the fourth
quarter because of his penetrating,'' Miller said. ''He got into
the seams and was making point-blank layups.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Bird said he was a little worried in the first
quarter, although he never panicked because the effort was there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept telling them if they play the same way we'll come back.
Our defense was excellent,'' Bird said. ''We just played hard ...
then Travis came in and gave us a lift. He can't see the floor as
well because of his size when he has big players coming at him, so
he just has to use his quickness to break down the defense and make
something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Best was 7-for-11 from the field -- 2-for-3 on 3-pointers -- and
was 8-of-10 from the free throw line as the Knicks repeatedly
fouled him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very good one-on-one player, and he's a very good
pick-and-roll player,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''We
didn't handle him in either situation as we needed to in order to
keep him under control.''

<HEADLINE> Panel reviews EPA on PCB risk in Hudson  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- An independent panel of experts
agreed with federal researchers who warned of health risks from
eating upper Hudson River fish, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The peer review concluded Wednesday was among the many steps the
federal EPA must take before deciding whether to order a dredging
of the upper Hudson. The agency is scheduled to make its proposal
in December.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member peer panel reviewed findings released by the EPA
last summer that claimed risks to people eating PCB-contaminated
fish from the upper Hudson River are many times higher than
acceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
   The panel unanimously agreed that cancer risks and non-cancer
health hazards from eating the contaminated fish in that area are
above ''levels of concern,'' said EPA Hudson River project manager
Alison Hess.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased with the outcome of the peer review,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members said the EPA's data and conclusions appeared
sound, but called for some revisions. For instance, they suggested
the inclusion of guidelines for evaluating the effects of PCBs on
pregnant and lactating women. And panel members said more detailed
data needed to be provided on the range of risks to human health.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the six panel members called for major revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said the recommended revisions would require additional
analysis of data the EPA already has. She said the EPA would
consider all the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Hess did not expect the EPA's December proposal deadline to be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for General Electric, which opposes dredging, said
the peer reviewers uncovered the same flaws in the EPA's health
analysis that GE had found earlier. Mark Behan said that without
''substantial changes'' in the report, the EPA's health risk
assessment would not be scientifically defensible.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are obliged to implement the recommendations,'' Behan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution from GE factories on the Hudson is largely blamed for
the PCB -- or polychlorinated biphenyl -- content in the river. The
substance, used as insulating material in transformers and other
electrical equipment, was banned by the federal government in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   If a dredging is ordered, General Electric could be forced to
spend billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The company released it own study last year showing the river is
cleaning up naturally. More recently it launched an advertising
campaign noting that more than 50 local governments have passed
resolutions opposing dredging and landfilling.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokeswoman Ann Rychlenski said the panel's findings are
significant in light of GE's ''disinformation campaign.'' Behan
said the comment was ''outrageous'' and dismissive of public
opinion in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A final peer review panel looking over the EPA's ecological risk
assessment of the river is set to work today and Friday.

<HEADLINE> Cornell astronomers say Eros is relic of solar system's birth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) --An unexpected ''snapshot'' produced by a
powerful solar flare has given scientists evidence that the
asteroid Eros is a primitive relic from the dawn of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   The findings from NASA's NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft revealed to
scientists for the first time the chemical composition of an
asteroid, said Steven Squyres, a Cornell astronomy professor and
one of the scientists who analyzed the ''snapshot.''
</P>
<P>
   Orbiting 100 million miles from Earth, the 21-mile-long Eros
appears to have escaped heating and melting and remained largely
unchanged since the initial formation of the solar system from a
cloud of gas and dust, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By looking at an asteroid like Eros, we are looking at one of
the solar system's basic building blocks,'' Squyres said.
</P>
<P>
   Squyres' team announced its discovery Tuesday at a meeting of
the American Geophysical Union in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The event that led to the surprise findings was a powerful solar
flare on May 4. For 30 minutes, X-rays produced by the solar
explosion washed over the asteroid, producing a ''glow'' called
X-ray fluorescence, Squyres said.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed scientists to record the different elements on the
asteroid's surface ''glowing'' at different wavelengths, he said.
The snapshot covered an area about 3.7 miles across. Scientists
found elements of magnesium, silicon and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Eros, we are seeing the ratios of silicon, magnesium and
aluminum ... all basically preserved as they were in the solar
nebula, and nothing much has happened since ... so we are seeing
into the very distant past,'' Squyres said.
</P>
<P>
   Eros is classified as an S-type asteroid, the most common
classification. Squyres said the latest evidence provides ''a key
piece of information suggesting that many other S asteroids also
might show this primitive characteristic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he cautioned, that the findings are just the first and
from only a small area of Eros and that asteroids remained
''puzzling and bizarre'' objects.
</P>
<P>
   Over the coming months, NEAR -- Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous --
will provide scientists with X-ray readings from the entire body of
Eros as part of its exploration mission. Presently, NEAR is
orbiting about 31 miles above Eros. On July 7, the spacecraft will
begin a gradual descent to an orbit just 22 miles above the
asteroid's surface.

<HEADLINE> Oz museum quest a muddled mess  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHITTENANGO, N.Y. (AP) -- The yellow brick road has turned into a
brick wall for a local group trying to build a museum to honor Oz
author and native son L. Frank Baum.
</P>
<P>
   The Chittenango Foundation has fallen at least six months behind
in its mortgage payment on a four-acre site where the Baum family
once lived. It is selling the land for half of what it paid for it
to help pay off debts. After two decades, the dream of a permanent
museum is fading.
</P>
<P>
   The local foundation has been plagued by other problems, too,
including a failure to file annual reports required by state and
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see anything that's happened that we should be ashamed
of,'' said Curt Tobin, who was the organization's president from
1992 until 1997. ''We're not as far along as we'd like, I
suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, the all-volunteer group has organized OzFest to
try to raise money for a museum. A 450-square-foot temporary museum
is set up in the rear of the local Masonic Temple.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which started out as a ''birthday'' party at the
village library, now draws about 25,000 people -- about five times
the village's population. This year's OzFest runs from Thursday
through Sunday and includes food, music, a parade and visits by a
handful of the original ''munchkins'' from the classic 1939 movie
''The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   While attendance has grown, profits have not. Chittenango
Foundation officials said OzFest costs about $40,000 to stage and
the foundation barely brings in enough each year to meet expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the foundation spent $74,000 for the Baum family site,
intending to erect a museum there. It borrowed $61,000 from two
local businessman, a loan it has yet to repay. The foundation has
spent more than $98,000 in down payments, principal, interest and
taxes on the land, said Foundation President Charles Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing poorly because we put so much money into the
land,'' Goldsmith said. ''The previous leadership bought the land
and we're stuck with it. We were foolish the way some of the money
was spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, there is some evidence that the Baum site
may actually have been on the other side of the road from the
foundation's property.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's financial failings also have cost it in other
ways.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators set aside $25,000 for the museum in the past
three budgets but the foundation never submitted the proper
paperwork to collect the money. The money will soon be lost if the
foundation doesn't come forward, said Allen James, a spokesman for
the state Parks Department.
</P>
<P>
   Current foundation officials characterize their problems as the
legacy of the previous leadership. They said they are turning the
corner and are not quite ready to give up their dream of a
permanent museum. Last year, OzFest cleared about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers also are working out details to donate the Masonic
Temple to the foundation as a permanent museum. If that fails,
foundation members said they will look for another site.
</P>
<P>
   Should it happen, the L. Frank Baum-Oz Museum would feature the
writings of Baum, who was born in Chittenango in 1856 and moved to
Syracuse when he was 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The first of Baum's 14 Oz books was published in 1900 and
quickly became a best seller. In 1939, Hollywood turned the first
book, ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' into one of the most popular
movies of all time.

<HEADLINE> Appellate Court reverses lower court decision, effectively ousting Essenberg </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY -- The Independence Party State Committee was within its
power to oust party Chairman Jack Essenberg and five members of his
executive committee in February, an appellate court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision, a reversal of an earlier decision by a
lower court, places Frank MacKay of Suffolk County in the
leadership position for Monday's state convention in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the party is expected to nominate its choice for the
nationally watched U.S. Senate race pitting first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton against U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio. There is also a
possibility that Independence Party convention delegates could
authorize a Sept. 12 primary featuring both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In April, State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Malone ruled that
since Essenberg did not set the agenda for the Feb. 4 meeting
resulting in his ouster, that removal was null and void.
</P>
<P>
   After Essenberg walked out of that meeting, committee members
voted to remove Essenberg and replace him with MacKay of North
Babylon, Long Island. Essenberg attorney Thomas Spargo appealed to
Malone, who stayed the action of the committee and ordered
Essenberg be restored as chair.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was fueled by a rivalry between factions of the
Independence Party, which is New York state's version of the
national Reform Party. One faction was led by Essenberg and the
other by leftist activist Lenora Fulani.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani's unconventional backing of conservative Pat Buchanan for
the party's presidential nomination brought her in opposition to
Essenberg, who at the time favored Donald Trump for the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Laureen Oliver of Rochester, party secretary and founder, touted
the latest ruling, saying it would allow the party to remove
leaders who believe the party should be an ''appendix'' of larger
state parties.
</P>
<P>
   She said Essenberg ''wanted to be another Mike Long or another
Raymond Harding,'' referring respectively to leaders of the state
Conservative and Liberal parties. ''It won't work. We're too
demographically spread,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Essenberg, reached Wednesday night, said he was ''obviously
disappointed'' with the ruling and that he would bring the matter
to the state Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll deal with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Fulani spokeswoman could not be reached for comment Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of third-party nominations is strong in New York.
Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to also
run on third-party ballot lines and combine their vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Republican George Pataki beat Democratic incumbent
Mario Cuomo in the governor's race on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the line brought more than 109,000 extra votes to
Democrat Charles Schumer as he beat Republican incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Independence Party became New York's third
largest political party. As of March 1, it had more than 172,471
members. The Conservative Party fell into fourth place with 171,496
members. Both are dwarfed by the Democratic (4.96 million members)
and the Republican (3.09 million members) parties.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers interested in Maine's approach to drug costs  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Pharmaceutical industry representatives
argued with state senators Wednesday who said people in New York
and other states pay unnecessarily high prices compared to those in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, has introduced a
bill requiring that drugs not be sold in New York priced higher
than in any other part of the world. He's also suggesting that New
York form a compact with other states setting price requirements at
the lowest prices available in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our interest goes far beyond senior citizens,'' Marchi said
during a public hearing Wednesday. ''This would affect every single
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchi said prices in this country are more than 50 percent more
than in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Powell, assistant general counsel for Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, and a colleague had a few
testy exchanges with Marchi's colleagues during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coverage rather than price controls,'' she said, adding that
insurers have ''frankly been quite successful'' in negotiating drug
prices for patients and that the system should continue without
state involvement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the industry's arguments is that research, development
and availability of new drugs could suffer if manufacturers are
forced to reduce prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Maziarz, R-Niagara Falls, called that
''disingenuous'' considering all the money drug makers spend on
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers were visibly more interested in remarks by a
legislator from Maine, which is the first state to agree to use its
bargaining power to negotiate prices of prescription medicine for
people without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's legislation had bipartisan support, Maine Sen. Chellie
Pingree said.
</P>
<P>
   While she said she would support federal price controls,
''Unfortunately they have yet to do that and we continue to pay the
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Pingree, majority leader of the Maine state Senate, said the
industry's 17 percent profit margin is higher than any other
business and that drug makers spend $24 billion on research and
development while making $26 billion in profits annually.
</P>
<P>
   Pingree said she's been asked to testify in other states, an
indication of a national concern over drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, which only invited speakers attended, Alan
Sagar, a Boston University professor of health services, testified
that if prescriptions were more affordable, drug companies would
still make money because more drugs would be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   He said Marchi's bill would help more people get the drugs they
need.
</P>
<P>
   Sagar presented a study saying that, not including the U.S.
total, New York state is fifth in the world in health care spending
-- after Japan, Germany, California and France. It spends $553
million on drugs. An estimated 4.7 million residents -- 26 percent --
have no drug coverage through insurance, he said. If price controls
were used, people in the state would pay $4.9 billion, 35.8 percent
less than this year's estimated $7.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's office said he would ''take a look'' at
Marchi's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has said prescription prices
need to be acted on before the legislative session ends in June,
but has not committed to support Marchi's bill.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Catholic Conference supports the bill as does New
York's AFL-CIO chapter. The Seniors Coalition and the Pharmacists
Society of the State of New York oppose it. The Health Care
Association of New York prefers imports of cheaper drugs from other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Giants 10, Phillies 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his 465th career home run
and Ellis Burks homered in his 35th major league ballpark as the
San Francisco Giants completed a three-game sweep of the
Philadelphia Phillies with a 10-4 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, filling in at shortstop for the injured Rich
Aurilia, homered and drove in three runs as the Giants won their
eighth straight against the Phillies dating to last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' homer tied him with Dave Winfield for 20th on the career
list. Burks' first homer at Pac Bell Ballpark gave him home runs in
35 major league stadiums. Only Mark McGwire and Fred McGriff have
homered in more ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (4-2) allowed four runs and seven hits in six
innings. He struck out three and didn't walk a batter to win
consecutive starts for the first time since Aug. 14 and 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Byrd (1-5) gave up seven runs and 10 hits, walked one and
struck out three as he lost his third straight. It was also his
first career loss to the Giants in four decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant hit his second homer in as many days for the Phillies,
who have lost five of their last seven.
</P>
<P>
   Gant's eighth home run of the season on a 1-1 pitch from Gardner
gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit a 1-0 pitch from Byrd into the center-field bleachers
for his 20th of the season, and his first since May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Burks' homer, a two-run shot into the left-field bleachers, gave
the Giants a 3-1 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Kevin Jordan, playing in place of injured third
baseman Scott Rolen, hit his first homer of the season to cut the
Giants' lead to 5-4 in the sixth. Brian Hunter added an RBI single
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's homer came off Byrd, who faced one more batter before
being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard also drove in a run for the Giants in the fourth
and added a two-run single in the ninth off Jeff Brantley, who gave
up three runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Aurilia got the night off after straining his left
hamstring Tuesday. He's scheduled for further evaluation Thursday.
... Phillies LHP Scott Aldred will have his left shoulder examined
in Philadelphia on Thursday by team doctor Michael Ciccotti. He
missed his second game as a result of the injury suffered Monday.
... The Phillies have not won a series against the Giants in the
last 11. ... The Phillies were 11-7 in interleague play last year,
including a 2-1 record against the Boston Red Sox.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Cardinals 2  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Aided by the first triple play in Arizona
history, Randy Johnson stopped the Diamondbacks' three-game losing
streak, passing Cy Young in career strikeouts Wednesday night in a
6-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (9-1) struck out 10 to reach double digits for the 10th
time in 12 starts this season, raising his major league-leading
total to 131 and his career mark to 2,824, five more than Young.
</P>
<P>
   He also induced the Diamondbacks' first triple play -- from Mark
McGwire, who later hit his major league-leading 21st home run.
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona leading 3-1 in the fifth inning, the bases were
loaded when McGwire popped to Steve Finley in shallow center field.
</P>
<P>
   Finley threw out Placido Polanco, who tagged up at third and
tried to score. After making the tag at the plate, catcher Damian
Miller threw to third, where shortstop Tony Womack tagged out Edgar
Renteria trying to advance.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth triple play in the majors this year and the
second this week -- Oakland's Randy Velarde turned an unassisted
triple play Monday at New York.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who tied Toronto's David Wells for the major league
lead in wins, struck out McGwire twice. Johnson allowed two runs
and nine hits in 7 2-3 innings, leaving after McGwire's first homer
in 30 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen (4-5) allowed six hits and five runs in 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell scored in the first inning on Hentgen's wild pitch, and
Arizona made it 3-0 in the fourth on Greg Colbrunn's RBI single and
Turner Ward's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston had an RBI single in the fifth. Arizona made it
5-1 in the eighth on Tony Womack's RBI single off Mike Matthews,
who was making his major league debut, and Bell's sacrifice fly off
Mark Thompson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Byung Hyun Kim got four outs for his sixth save, striking
out three. ... Johnson, 0-2 against St. Louis last year, evened his
record against the Cardinals at 3-3. ... The attendance of 39,761
pushed Arizona's total in 28 home games to 1,001,801. ... Johnson
is 91-26 with 18 no-decisions when striking out 10 or more. ... The
road loss was the Cards' first in five games. ... Hentgen dropped
to 61-35 in decisions on the road, including 3-3 this year, and to
24-16 in May, his best month.

<HEADLINE> Swiss To Force Back Kosovo Refugees  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The air at the Cafe Prishtina is thick with smoke
and anxiety as Kosovo Albanian refugees struggle with a harsh
choice: return home or be kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline for departure having expired on Wednesday,
Swiss authorities are preparing in the coming months to deport
10,500 Kosovars -- 500 in June alone -- who have outstayed their
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland took in tens of thousands of Kosovo war refugees
last year. And now it is in a hurry for them to leave, despite
warnings by U.N. officials that the shattered Yugoslav province
can't cope.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't go home as I haven't got a home,'' insists Bislim
Hojzeaj, nervously pulling at a cigarette as he seeks legal advice
at Geneva's Popular Albanian University, a cheerless factory-like
building opposite the city's soccer stadium. ''I don't know what
I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hojzeaj says he arrived in Switzerland in 1979 and labored on
building sites until he suffered a leg injury in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He was expelled in 1996 because he had no valid work permit, but
returned in 1998 because of ethnic tensions in Kosovo and
increasing pains in his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Aged beyond his 47 years by work and worry, Hojzeaj hopes he
will be allowed to stay on medical grounds, arguing he and his wife
both need treatment they can't obtain in Kosovo. His children, aged
18, 14, 6 and 2, were all born in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors of police raids swirl through the university canteen --
named after Kosovo's regional capital -- the climate of suspicion is
such that Hojzeaj is one of the few willing to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But he is wary as he writes the spelling of his name for a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a signature. I'm not signing to anything,'' he
repeats, reflecting widespread comments by ethnic Albanians that
the Swiss pressured them into signing their return forms.
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of last year, more than 32,000 ethnic Albanians
have either returned home or registered to do so under a Swiss
government program that included cash handouts of up to $1,176 per
adult and building materials upon arrival in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The figures include people who fled both before and during the
fighting last year between Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels that led to NATO intervention and the deployment of
international peacekeepers in Kosovo, a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.N. official in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, praised
Switzerland on Wednesday as one of the ''rare'' countries that
opened its doors wide. But he pleaded for extra time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask you please to be reasonable,'' Kouchner said during a
brief visit here. ''It's a real burden for Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Ruth Metzler has refused to delay the
expulsions, under pressure from center-right parties and from the
widespread public perception of ethnic Albanians as petty criminals
and drug-traffickers. But she says the action will be gradual.
</P>
<P>
   ''There won't be police in front of the door of all Kosovars on
June 1,'' she said in a recent newspaper interview, stressing that
police will try to avoid using force.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, officials are vague on how they will persuade desperate
people to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities estimate that of the 10,500 due to be deported,
about one half will ''disappear'' to other countries or go
underground in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Mejreme Priakaj said she wouldn't dare risk expulsion and that
it was impossible for her whole family to hide from authorities. So
the family reluctantly signed up to go back to Kosovo even though
their house in a village near Pec has been destroyed and her
husband -- a miner -- has no chance of work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want the children to be forced out of the house for a
second time,'' she said shuddering at the memories of the flight
last year. Her 16-year-old daughter Domika and 12-year-old son
Defrim still wake with nightmares, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trauma, the children are flourishing. A report by
Domika's teacher describes the girl as ''a pupil who never ceases
to amaze us by her intelligence and maturity,'' and it pleads for
her to be allowed to continue her studies ''in the best possible
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Priakaj family are considered lucky. Because their children
are all still at school, they can stay in Switzerland until
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Their attic apartment is cramped and stuffy, Priakaj said, but
it's better than the nuclear bunker that was ''home'' for their
first six months as Swiss authorities struggled to find shelter for
the new arrivals. And the family manages to survive on Swiss
monthly handouts of $882.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Kosovo Albanians, the Priakaj family would like
to go back at some stage. But they believe the Swiss moves are
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree that our future is in Kosovo,'' Priakaj said. ''But
without a house or roof over our heads, it's difficult to see it
that way.''

<HEADLINE> Appeal for Rights Victims in China  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chen Gang's death sentence was commuted to life
imprisonment. His offense? Setting furniture afire.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Jie got 18 years for giving speeches and blocking traffic
during a protest.
</P>
<P>
   They are among 213 prisoners Amnesty International says remain
unjustly jailed in connection with the government's crackdown on
the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years after Chinese troops crushed the protests, killing
hundreds of unarmed demonstrators, human rights groups are still
campaigning for the crackdown's victims: people injured when
soldiers shot their way through Beijing, family members of those
killed, and prisoners it says were unfairly condemned to lengthy
jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   This year's anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown comes
less than two weeks after the U.S. House of Representatives voted
to permanently grant China low-tariff trade rights, ending 20 years
of annual China trade debates that, especially since Tiananmen,
focused attention on Beijing's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Without the debates, U.S. officials and rights advocates are
pondering how to continue pushing Beijing to improve its rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases cited by London-based Amnesty International in a
report released Wednesday was that of Peng Cheng, an engineer sent
to a labor camp in September for collecting signatures for a
petition demanding the government reassess its condemnation of the
1989 protests as ''counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen Gang, a manual worker, was sentenced to death for burning
furniture in the home of a security official at his factory in
Hunan province in 1989. His sentence was commuted to life
imprisonment, as was that of Wang Lianxi, after her defense argued
she was mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   They are among 65 people Amnesty says are known to be serving
life sentences in connection with the 1989 protests. Thousands more
were given lesser sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The report urged China to release all prisoners held for the
''peaceful exercise of fundamental human rights'' in the 1989
demonstrations and subsequent protests, to account for those killed
and injured, to compensate victims and to ''bring the perpetrators
to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appeal to China's top prosecutor's office, 108
injured survivors and victims' relatives demanded a response,
required by law, to a petition they submitted last year for an
investigation into the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like it might be even harder to get an answer this
year than last year. It gets harder and harder, but we will
continue to push for our demands,'' said signatory Ding Zilin, a
retired professor whose son was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also demanded punishment of the leader considered
most closely associated with ordering soldiers to fire: former
Premier Li Peng. Li, the ruling Communist Party's second-most
powerful leader, now heads China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The government has never allowed an investigation into the
crackdown or a full accounting of those killed. Authorities have
detained dissidents demanding redress and harassed family members
of victims seeking compensation, seizing foreign donations sent to
ease their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rights activists believe they have succeeded in drawing
attention to abuses that would go ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody has to keep beating the drums,'' says John Kamm, a
businessman who has long lobbied Chinese officials on behalf of
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm, who runs a private foundation based in San Francisco, says
a new commission to monitor Beijing's labor and human rights
practices could help, but only if more money and personnel are
invested in it. The commission was part of the China trade bill
passed May 24 by the House and now headed for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Many concerned with Beijing's rights record, including
dissidents both inside and outside China, as well as U.S.
officials, believe the annual trade reviews had ceased to exert
much pressure on China. Annual attempts to censure China's record
at the United Nations Human Rights Commission have failed nine
years straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''To do nothing about human rights in China is not really
sustainable,'' says Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science
at Columbia University. ''But the government has not found
instruments to work on this area that seem effective.''

Higher Gasoline Prices Predicted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. chairman Lee Raymond said Wednesday gasoline
supplies could tighten this summer because of a dispute over Unocal Corp.'s
patent on producing reformulated gasoline. Refiners who must use other blending
methods to make the cleaner-burning fuel won't be able to produce as much
gasoline, probably causing prices to rise, Raymond told reporters after a
shareholders meeting. He said he could not estimate the price increase at the
pump or how long the increase would last.

List Targets Top Drug Traffickers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is trying to put the financial
squeeze on the world's biggest drug kingpins, but there are fears innocent
people and businesses could get caught in the wringer. The administration is
required, under legislation approved last year, to provide Congress by Thursday
with a list of what it considers to be the top foreign drug traffickers. Those
on the list -- and their foreign business associates -- would have their U.S.
assets frozen in most cases. Americans would be barred from doing business with
them.

Clinton Asked To Name More Monuments
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt Wednesday asked President
Clinton to declare four new national monuments, including one at the Hanford
nuclear reservation in Washington state that would protect 200,000 acres. The
other three would protect nearly 351,000 acres of federal land in Oregon,
Colorado and Arizona. If Clinton approves the request, as expected, he will have
used the Antiquities Act to protect nearly 3.7 million acres -- the second most
by a U.S. president.

Philly School Takeover Averted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mayor John F. Street announced a plan Wednesday to bail
out the Philadelphia schools, averting a state takeover of the financially
strapped school district -- at least through next year. The state will put up
nearly $70 million through deferred taxes and the city will add $20 million
under the plan, though Street said it was unclear how the city would come up
with its share of the money. The school board approved also about $30 million in
cuts Wednesday, primarily in administrative offices, teacher training programs
and staffing in a comprehensive day-care program.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an assessment of women's progress toward equality,
the United Nations reported Wednesday that more girls are attending school --
but that all females still confront ''a global epidemic'' of violence. The mixed
snapshot for women five years after a major international women's conference in
Beijing shows they comprise an increasing share of the world's labor force but
are making no headway in cracking the top echelons of business and government.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Palestinian official said Wednesday that Israel has

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Clinton designed to push forward

FCC Change Will Lower Phone Bills

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All telephone customers are expected to see savings
beginning with their July long-distance bills under a dramatic overhaul devised
by the industry and adopted by the Federal Communications Commission Wednesday.
People who make few or no long-distance calls could see their bills drop by as
much as 50 percent. The commission cut by $3.2 billion the ''access fees'' that
local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect calls -- costs
that are typically assessed to consumers.

<HEADLINE> Eminem Album Sells 1.7M First Week  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Call him Slim Shady, call him Eminem or even by
his real name, Marshall Mathers. He's probably too happy right now
to care.
</P>
<P>
   The foul-mouthed rapper sold 1.7 million copies of his new album
last week, zipping up the charts past the sunny teen pop stars he
ridicules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' is second only to 'N Sync's ''No
Strings Attached'' as the fastest-selling album in the nine years
the industry-tracking company Soundscan has been keeping accurate
count. No other rap album has sold so many copies in its first
week.
</P>
<P>
   MTV built anticipation for the album with heavy airtime, letting
Eminem serve as host of a two-hour ''EmTV'' special the weekend
before the May 23 release date. He was a guest on the network's
popular ''Total Request Live'' the first afternoon the album was on
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The profane rapper, who has been sued by his own mother for
defamation of character, appeals primarily to rap and rock fans but
has crossed over into MTV's larger pop audience, said Tom
Calderone, MTV senior vice president for music programming.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as aggressive hip-hop or rock, there isn't anything new
out there,'' Calderone said. ''He's a welcome new sound that hit
the stores at a time people hadn't heard it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem pushes aside -- at least for a week -- the teen pop he has
mocked. He has rapped that the popular boy and girl groups ''make
me sick'' and joked in his music about Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera performing a sex act on him.
</P>
<P>
   His album came a week after Britney Spears sold 1.3 million
copies of her new CD, which temporarily put her second to 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   It means the three fastest-selling albums have come in the last
two months. Soundscan has measured music sales since 1991; precise
sales figures from before that are considered unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   As a white artist in a field popularized by blacks, Eminem
benefited from a key endorsement from rapper Dr. Dre. Eminem grew
up near Detroit and has played up his ''trailer park'' upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   His new song ''Kill You'' talks about killing women -- including
Mom -- with the lyrics, ''I'm ready to play, I got the machete from
O.J.''
</P>
<P>
   At the song's end, he laughs and says: ''I'm just playin',
ladies. You know I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   He says half the things he puts on disc are done just to annoy
people, but not everyone thinks it's a joke. The Gay &AMP; Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation criticized him Tuesday for anti-gay
lyrics, including the line: ''Hate fags? The answer's yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem has told MTV that he doesn't hate gays. But GLAAD said it
is irresponsible for him and UNI/Interscope Records to promote such
material.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is especially negligent when considering the market for
this music has been shown to be adolescent males, the very group
that statistically commits the most hate crimes,'' GLAAD said.
</P>
<P>
   Even his grandmother has joined his mother in publicly
criticizing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's changed for the worse,'' Betty Kresin said in December.
''He talks filthy to me and is angry and disrespectful. I don't
know what's gotten into him.''

<HEADLINE> Big Draw in Michael J. Fox Finale  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television viewers -- 32 million of them -- showed
their fondness for Michael J. Fox by tuning in to his farewell
episode of ''Spin City'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest rating ever for the 4-year-old ABC political
comedy, and the biggest audience for any comedy on the network
since the final ''Home Improvement'' last year, Nielsen Media
Research said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spin City'' is continuing next season with Charlie Sheen,
despite Fox's departure because of his Parkinson's disease. Last
week's episode was heavily promoted as a farewell, though ABC has
said Fox will appear in a handful of episodes next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spin City'' eclipsed three installments of ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' in the ratings, enabling ABC to maintain its
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a successful night for dramas: ABC's season finale
of ''NYPD Blue'' and CBS's competing ''Judging Amy'' both finished
in Nielsen's top 10.

<HEADLINE> Columbus, Indians Honored in Ala.  </HEADLINE>
By PHILLIP RAWLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Christopher Columbus, who's credited
with discovering America, will share his state holiday with
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama Legislature has voted to make the second Monday in
October do double duty as Columbus Day and American Indian Heritage
Day. The combination that will begin Oct. 9 is the first by any
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Columbus did not discover America. He found we were here
already. It's a recognition that has been long deserved,'' Nancy
Carnley, secretary of the Ma-Chis Lower Creek Indian Tribe, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of state holidays by the National Conference of State
Legislatures found several other states have days set aside to
honor American Indians -- often the fourth Friday in September -- but
they are not official holidays where state offices close.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, South Dakota has had an official holiday on the
second Monday in October for Native American Day. The state does
not recognize Columbus Day.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic legislators who serve on the Alabama Indian
Affairs Commission, Sen. Jimmy Holley and Rep. Jeff Dolbare,
sponsored the bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Don
Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   Holley said members of the commission felt Indians were long
overdue for recognition by a state whose name comes from a tribe in
central Alabama. He said that placing American Indian Heritage Day
on a day that was already a state holiday won't cost state
government more money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see this as where this state is headed. We are trying to
heal old wounds,'' said Wilford Taylor, chief of the Mowa Band of
Choctaw Indians.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans of European ancestry usually look on Columbus as
an important historical figure, many American Indians see him as
the first of the European explorers who exploited and murdered
their ancestors and introduced new diseases that killed many
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Wabun-Inini, national representative for the American Indian
Movement Grand Governing Council, said the organization considers
Columbus a colonial pirate who should not be glamorized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We commend the state of Alabama for their vision and reaching
out to the Indian people,'' he said Wednesday. ''We would hope
other states would follow the lead of Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the Alabama Legislature has created a
dual state holiday. In 1994, the Legislature decided to recognize
the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. on the third Monday in
January, which was already a state holiday honoring the birthday of
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Darla Graves, executive director of the state's Indian affairs
commission, said the Census Bureau estimated Alabama had 28,000
American Indians in 1998. But she expects they have been
undercounted and the real number exceeds 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't always been politically correct to acknowledge your
Indian ancestry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To help reverse that, she said the commission plans to work with
tribes across the state to have a big celebration each American
Indian Heritage Day.

<HEADLINE> Wonder Bread Worker Accuses Bias  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- George Lassiter worked at the Wonder Bread
plant for 28 years, and says he did such a good job he could run
the bakery by himself. He was never promoted beyond foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter says it's because he's black.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of 21 workers from a San Francisco plant who have
joined in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a subsidiary of the
nation's largest wholesale baker, claiming they were denied
promotions, subjected to racist comments and given the worst
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''People less qualified than me got promoted. People I trained
got promoted,'' said Lassiter, who retired early due to what he
termed as workplace stress. ''If I would have been white, I would
have been promoted long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurora LaGroan, a bread wrapper at the plant who has filed a
separate lawsuit against Interstate Brands Corp., said she was
repeatedly called stupid and a racial slur, and at one point a
group of white workers threw bread at her.
</P>
<P>
   Theodis Carroll, the lead plaintiff in the case, says he was
repeatedly called ''boy'' by one of his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Other employees said they were told not to congregate during
breaks at the plant in the city's South of Market district,
apparently because managers feared they would look like a street
gang.
</P>
<P>
   IBC denies all the charges. The company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Interstate Bakeries Corp., based in Kansas City, Mo.,
which has 63 regional bakeries and is known for such brands as
Wonder Bread and Hostess Cupcakes. The Fortune 500 company made
$126 million last year on sales of $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Alioto, who represents 18 of the employees, said the suit
does not specify a specific amount for compensatory and punitive
damages. One number Alioto has mentioned is $260 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trial opened last week in San Francisco Superior Court.
Attorneys said it could last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said the discrimination affected every black worker at
the plant as well as other IBC locations. IBC employs 1,100 people
in Northern California, and there is ''not one African American
employee in management,'' she claimed in opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Mullin, attorney for IBC, said none of the workers had
ever complained of discrimination, and if they had, the issue would
have been dealt with swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found out about it in the (San Francisco) Examiner the day
after they filed it,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   But LaGroan, whom Alioto is representing in a separate lawsuit,
said she went to her supervisor, the union and human resources
complaining of the abuse, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Her supervisor, she maintained, was a big part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me he was investigating it but I was probably the
problem,'' she testified through tears. ''He told me he was tired
of me coming to his office and complaining about it.''
</P>
<P>
   LaGroan was fired from her job after going on disability for a
year, and under cross-examination, said she had had a nervous
breakdown and was under a psychiatrist's care for work-related
stress.
</P>
<P>
   IBC executives would not comment on the suit's specifics, but
the company issued a statement saying it ''does not tolerate
discrimination in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a strong policy against discriminatory behavior. And
we have a track record of taking strong and immediate action
whenever a question of discrimination arises,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Chances For Woman VP Seem Slim  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cheering, foot-stamping and tears lasted
for eight minutes after Geraldine Ferraro accepted the Democratic
nomination for vice president, the first woman to be nominated by a
major party.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, both Republican George W. Bush and Democrat
Al Gore say they are considering women for the No. 2 spot. But
despite gains made by women elsewhere in politics, most observers
figure the chances for a female veep this year are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic that women voters are such a key target group and
yet there is so little talk about a woman for VP,'' said Celinda
Lake, a Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   For the GOP, there's Elizabeth Dole, who made a run at the top
job, and New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, a moderate from a swing
state.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole didn't make much of a showing in her presidential bid,
dropping out before the first votes were cast. Whitman is a strong
supporter of abortion rights, and religious conservatives have
warned Bush not to pick her.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Gore is expected to consider Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who hails from California, the biggest electoral prize.
But Feinstein is also running for re-election this year,
complicating her prospects. And if Gore is to win, California
should be in his column even without a local on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Other names are bandied about, but none are thought to be
serious prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential nominees are typically considered from two
groups -- people who have run for president themselves and
governors, Lake said. And despite women's advancement through the
ranks of politics, very few women fall into either group.
</P>
<P>
   Only three states have female governors, and Dole is the only
woman from either major party to have been regarded, however
briefly, as a serious contender for her party's presidential
nomination. ''That's the ultimate glass ceiling,'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Walter Mondale and Ferraro, then a New
York congresswoman, lost in 1984 as Republicans Ronald Reagan and
George Bush easily won re-election. And each of the three elections
since then has pitted one pair of men against another.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't work out the first time, so I think candidates were
wary of choosing a woman,'' said Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the
lieutenant governor of Maryland who is viewed as a rising star in
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   With the first-time excitement come and gone, observers say
women will not be picked simply for their gender but because they
bring the right personality, ideology or geographic balance to a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1984, it was 'Oh it will never happen, it will never
happen,''' said Ferraro, who was skeptical herself when, in 1983, a
group of women asked her to think about her own prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter who it was, it was a historic event. Now, it's not
going to be historic. It's just good politics,'' she said. ''We've
matured about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a woman to the vice presidency -- and eventually to the
Oval Office -- could depend on building a pipeline of women in
office -- senators, governors, Cabinet secretaries, the sort of
people a nominee looks to when making the pick.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pipeline is considerably fuller. Nine women serve in
the Senate, compared with just two in 1984, and women have more
than doubled their numbers in the House, to 58. A woman now serves
as secretary of state, one of eight women in President Clinton's
extended Cabinet. And this year, Dole mounted a full-scale, albeit
aborted, campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The key is having enough qualified women out there so that one
will mesh with the presidential nominee, said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first hurdle you have to cross is the credentials, the
experience, the credibility and the record. Now women have passed
that hurdle,'' Hutchison said. ''The next hurdle has to be the
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Take New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a well-respected
Democrat whose state is not key to the general election. ''If
Jeanne Shaheen was the governor of Ohio or Illinois we'd have a
different conversation,'' said Marie C. Wilson, president of The
White House Project, which is working to change the political
climate so that a woman might be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats mentioned include Sen. Mary Landrieu of
Louisiana and Townsend, who is expected to run for Maryland
governor, but both are generally seen as not quite ready for the
No. 2 job. Republican women in the pipeline include Rep. Jennifer
Dunn of Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   There's still that problem that some of the excitement of
choosing a woman is gone, said Joan McClean, part of a group of
feminists that built support for Mondale to pick a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you try to break a barrier, there's a momentum that
has a life of its own,'' said McClean, now a government professor
at Ohio University. ''The bar is much higher now.''

<HEADLINE> Disparities Still Exist For Women  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Five years after a major international
conference pledged to seek full equality of the sexes, more women
are working and more girls are going to school -- but women remain
underpaid, under-represented in governments and under threat of
physical and sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.N. reports released Wednesday painted a mixed picture of
progress since the 1995 U.N. conference in Beijing, concluding that
equality for women remains a distant goal on issues ranging from
the workplace to education, health, human rights and political
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''Available data show that women are making gains, but
persistent disparities exist between men and women,'' said U.N.
Undersecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Nitan Desai.
</P>
<P>
   A 180-page report on ''The World's Women 2000'' produced by the
U.N. Statistics Division and a 21-page report by the U.N.
Children's Fund on ''Domestic Violence Against Women and Girls''
were released before a five-day ministerial conference opening
Monday to review progress on implementing the ambitious platform
for action adopted in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It called on governments to revise laws to ensure women's equal
rights, to provide equal education for girls and ensure the right
of women to decide matters of sexual and reproductive health. It
also urged governments and businesses to put women in top
decision-making positions and called for the elimination of
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   But five years later, the UNICEF report said, ''violence against
women and girls continues to be a global epidemic that kills,
tortures, and maims -- physically, psychologically, sexually and
economically.''
</P>
<P>
   And it said too few nations have moved to stop violence against
women, ranging from infanticide to spousal abuse to honor killings.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF said most data on violence against women is believed to
be ''not only conservative, but unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it concluded that ''a growing body of research
studies confirms the prevalence of physical violence in all parts
of the globe, including the estimates of 20 to 50 percent of women
from country to country who have experienced domestic violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Statistics Division report also concluded that physical
and sexual abuse affects millions of girls and women worldwide --
and remains under-reported.
</P>
<P>
   In education, school enrollment figures show the gender gap
closing in primary and secondary schooling. But the report said the
gap is still wide in 22 African countries and nine Asian countries
where enrollment for girls is less than 80 percent of the
enrollment for boys.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unlikely this gap will be closed by the target date of
2005,'' Desai said.
</P>
<P>
   While the statistical report showed women generally marrying
later, having fewer children, and living longer, it also found that
they comprise two-thirds of the world's illiterates and almost half
the victims of HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to work, the study found that at least one-third
of women are part of the work force in all regions except northern
Africa and western Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But it also concluded that ''women remain at the lower end of a
segregated labor market and continue to be concentrated in a few
occupations, to hold positions of little or no authority and to
receive less pay than men.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since Beijing, the report said, ''women's
participation in the top levels of government and business has not
markedly increased.''

<HEADLINE> Spelling Bee Heads Into Finals  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The feelings were friendly, sometimes even
jovial among the 110 finalists who survived the opening rounds of
the 2000 Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   But today they get down to business.
</P>
<P>
   The first 138 children were eliminated from the 73rd bee
Wednesday after 10 hours of quizzing. By the end of the third
round, the youngsters, ages 9 to 15, had mastered -- or failed to
master -- 597 words, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Words spelled correctly included ''acquiesced,'' meaning
accepted or complied tacitly or passively; words that stumped the
young spelling aces included ''klinotaxis,'' defined as directional
orientation involving turning toward a stimulus; ''areology,'' the
scientific study of the planet Mars; or ''glottogonic,'' which
means of or relating to the origin of language.
</P>
<P>
   The championship rounds were continuing today, with the cable
sports network ESPN planning live coverage beginning at 1 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   As the survivors went back to their seats, they high-fived each
other and beamed out at proud parents. And even though many were
sweating under the bright lights and pressure of the hotel ballroom
of the Grand Hyatt, some youngsters found time for humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can I have a lifeline please? I'd like to call a friend,''
quipped Amy Bitely, using the now-familiar line from the television
game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to spelling ''halieutics,'' the art or practice
of fishing, the 13-year-old from Masontown, W.Va., was on her own.
Her answer: ''haleutax.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Thomas Brown of Wind Gap, Pa., had problems with his
French, struggling over the pronunciation of ''dansant,'' an
informal dance. The crowd and even Brown laughed at his attempts,
but he spelled the word correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's one person who knows how I feel,'' quipped Alex
Cameron, the bee's official pronouncer for 20 years. That wasn't
lost on the next contestant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why couldn't you have given me a French word?'' moaned Michael
Hartwell of Middletown, Pa., when he faced ''febrifugal,'' which
mean mitigating or removing fever. But he got it right anyway and
advanced to the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was eliminated in the second round on the word
''nepotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the contestants stumbled on difficult words such as
''duodenary,'' a term for anything containing 12 items, and
''trophallaxis,'' which refers to how social insects exchange food.
</P>
<P>
   First-round words were taken from a 3,500-word study booklet
designed by Scripps Howard and from the word lists most sponsors
use at their local bees. But for the final rounds, words are taken
from Webster's Third New International Dictionary and its addenda,
which contain more than 460,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants, most sponsored by their local newspapers, all
won regional bees to qualify. The top prize is $10,000, a choice of
encyclopedias and other awards. Scripps Howard, the newspaper group
based in Cincinnati, coordinates the national finals and produces
the word lists and study materials.

<HEADLINE> FCC Change Will Lower Phone Bills  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting in July, all U.S. households should
see savings on their phone bills, with reductions as high as 50
percent for those who don't make any long-distance calls. Moderate
to heavy long-distance users can expect to see more modest
decreases.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions will result from a dramatic overhaul of the phone
subsidy system that was devised by the industry and adopted by the
Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission cut by $3.2 billion the ''access fees'' that
local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect
calls -- costs that typically are paid by phone users. Long-distance
companies have pledged to pass on the savings, meaning their
customers should see lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Low-volume callers would see the most immediate benefits, with
their bills dropping $3 to $4 a month. Those who make a moderate or
large amount of calls may only see small reductions in the
short-run, but stand to gain from falling long-distance rates or
price wars that the new plan could trigger, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to affect everyone differently, but overall,
everyone is going to benefit from this plan,'' FCC Chairman William
Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should begin seeing the changes in their July
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also would see some reductions in their monthly
charges, although it is unclear just how much they would save.
Typically, businesses, which make a large volume of long-distance
calls, have benefited from access charge reductions with lower
per-minute fees as well.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have sliced access charges by several billion dollars
over the past few years to better reflect local phone companies'
connection costs. But Wednesday's reduction is the most dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's action implements an industry proposal offered by
long-distance carriers AT&AMP;T and Sprint and major local phone
companies Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the plan is a major step in moving the
long-distance business toward the trend of flat-rate pricing for a
package of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably the trend of the future,'' said John Nakahata,
spokesman for the industry coalition. ''This will allow those types
of plans to proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates warn that for Americans to realize the
full benefits of the FCC's action, long-distance companies must
drop their rates for middle-range callers, such as those who make
up to 60 minutes of calls a month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's success depends on whether ''long-distance companies
deliver on their promise to pass through the savings with rate
reductions,'' said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom, which did not sign onto the plan, said that based on
FCC data, it believes the plan ultimately will result in higher
rates for customers and additional revenue for the regional Bell
phone companies. U S West also did not join the industry coalition,
even though it must abide by the FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday's action, AT&AMP;T and Sprint pledged to
eliminate a minimum $3 monthly charge for residential customers on
their most basic calling plans, since some consumers make calls
totaling less than that amount.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T basic rate customer who makes 10 minutes of
long-distance calls a month would pay $6.87 a month under the new
system, down from $9.39 a month the customer was paying before, for
a savings of $2.52 a month. A person who makes no calls would pay
$4.68, compared with $9.39 before, for a savings of $4.71 each
month, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The person who makes no long-distance calls benefits both from
the elimination of the minimum monthly charge and from no longer
being assessed the so-called universal service fee by the
long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   More than 41 percent of long-distance users make 10 minutes or
less in calls each month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also folds together and reduces two flat-rate charges
now on monthly bills. One, known as the subscriber line charge,
covers the cost of the phone line from the local phone company into
the home and is capped at $3.50 a month. A second pays for
long-distance companies' use of the local phone network. It now
averages about $1.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
   These two costs will be consolidated and reduced to $4.35. It
rises to $5 next July.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, who have been indirectly paying to keep phone service
affordable for low-income people and those in high-cost areas, will
see these universal service charges spelled out separately in their
monthly bill. The fee, a percentage of their long-distance calls,
will go to a $650 million fund.
</P>
<P>
   A separate fee from their local phone company, averaging about
36 cents, will also be used to keep phone service affordable.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Reveal Croatian's Talks  </HEADLINE>
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Once private conversations of the late
president Franjo Tudjman are now filling the columns of Zagreb's
newspapers care of the man who succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   Stipe Mesic, elected president in February two months after
Tudjman's death from cancer, found tapes that his predecessor had
made of his private conversations over the course of his nine-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of keeping them confidential, Mesic delivered
transcripts to the press, saying he wanted the Croatian public ''to
see how decisions were made under Tudjman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is that those who violated the law end up behind
bars,'' Mesic told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations made public so far are from the final years of the
Tudjman era and do not include tapes from the 1991 war for
independence from Yugoslavia, nor from the period of the 1992-95
Bosnian conflict in which Croatia was deeply involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there has been nothing published to confirm the
widely held view that Tudjman and Yugoslavia's current president,
Slobodan Milosevic, conspired in 1991 to carve up
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   But the transcripts show that even in 1999 -- four years after he
signed the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia -- Tudjman still
dreamed of annexing part of that country.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should give no indication (to international officials)
that we wish ... the three-way division of Bosnia,'' the transcript
quotes Tudjman as telling a visiting Bosnian Croat leader in April,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, NATO was bombing Yugoslavia to force an end to
Milosevic's crackdown on Albanians in Kosovo. According to the
transcript, Tudjman reckoned that this could lead to the division
of Kosovo to Serb- and Albanian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman figured that such a division would set a precedent for
dividing Bosnia into Serb, Muslim and Croat sections, according to
the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   It also shows that Tudjman and his visitors discussed plans to
settle Croat refugees and build military barracks in parts of
Bosnia that they hoped to control under such a division.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts also show that despite Croatia's war with Serbs,
relations between Tudjman and Milosevic were not altogether
strained. One transcript shows that Tudjman last year apologized to
Milosevic for a book written by his aide, Hrvoje Sarinic, that
blasted the Yugoslav president for supporting the Serb rebellion
against Croatia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, I was not in favor of him publishing
that book and particularly being so sharp about,'' Milosevic,
Tudjman asked a caller who had ties to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcripts, Milosevic and Tudjman stayed in
contact through a businessman living in Switzerland. On another
occasion, the businessman told Tudjman that Milosevic sent him
''warm regards and best wishes'' for his recovery from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In another transcript, Tudjman and an aide allegedly plot to
secretly buy the largest Croatian newspaper, Vecernji list, for
their then ruling party while pretending it was bought by a foreign
media company.
</P>
<P>
   That transcript has prompted a police investigation into the
sale of the newspaper to an Austrian firm. The government has
suspended the sale pending the outcome of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Ivic Pasalic, claims the conversation was fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Although the transcripts so far contain no ''smoking guns'' of
criminal activity, they provide an insight into the Tudjman regime.
Political analyst Jelena Lovric said they confirm a pattern of
''paranoia, conspiracy, plots and frauds, unscrupulous despotism
and decisions which outwitted people and laws.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Croats, the transcripts confirm what they always
suspected of their government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did suspect all of what we're reading now,'' said Dora
Vlacic, 48, a painter. ''But it's still shocking because we now
know that everything we hoped was just mean gossip was actually
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Release of the tapes has also drawn mixed reactions about Mesic,
now dubbed ''Sherlock Mesic'' by the Zagreb press.
</P>
<P>
   Some see him as a fighter who only wants to reveal and punish
the wrongdoings of Tudjman and his clique. His opponents say the
transcripts seen so far offer little proof of actual crimes and
that it is up to police -- and not media -- to carry out
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's party, now in the opposition, insisted the
conversations should be classified. The ruling parties rejected the
idea.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Urge Cancer Patients' Rights  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. (AP) -- On the eve of a campaign address on cancer
patients' rights, Vice President Al Gore assured angry tobacco
workers that he does not want to ban cigarettes and would take
steps to protect their jobs -- as long as it doesn't undercut
efforts to keep kids from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy to do anything I can to help you preserve your
livelihood, but I am not going to say or do anything that in any
way undermines or weakens the toughest possible measures to prevent
children from ever getting into the habit of smoking. Now if that
costs me votes, I'm willing to pay that price,'' Gore said
Wednesday evening at an open meeting with Macon-area voters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he was scheduled to speak in Atlanta, expanding on
proposals to tighten privacy of medical records and ban businesses
and health plans from discriminating against workers who find
through genetic testing that they are likely to get cancer and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also was expected to call for legislation that could be
''fast tracked'' through Congress to speed Medicare coverage of
such testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential contender, who traveled to Georgia
with the widower of his sister Nancy, who died of lung cancer in
1984, was sharply questioned by employees of Brown &AMP; Williamson's
tobacco manufacturing plant here.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told Gore she would like to vote for him, but that she
and her co-workers think the government is trying to eliminate
their jobs with its anti-smoking campaign and litigation against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Harris, the local Machinists union president, showed Gore
photos of a vacant fabrication unit at B&AMP;W where, Harris said,
machinery has already been shipped overseas -- with Macon-area jobs
sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former smoker, told both that tobacco companies were
making their own economic decisions to relocate operations abroad
and that they had nothing to do with the federal crackdown on
cigarette sales and marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
   ''If, over time, the demand (for cigarettes) is decreased and
the jobs are lost as a result of that, then we have to accept that
fact,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen someone die from lung cancer and a lot of families
have been affected by it, and it's almost completely preventable
and I am just not going to compromise on it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted he does not intend to outlaw cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how deep my concern, I have never advocated making
the product illegal. There are tens of millions of adult smokers
and, in recognition of that reality, there's just a universal
acceptance on all sides of the debate that the product is going to
remain legal,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 4, Mets 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Elster homered in the ninth inning and
Chad Kreuter also connected as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the New
York Mets 4-3 Wednesday night in a game overshadowed by injuries to
Mike Piazza and Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (4-3) relieved to start the ninth and Elster
homered against his former team for the first time, lining the ball
into the left-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike Fetters (2-0) retired two batters in the top on
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was knocked out of the game in the sixth when Gary
Sheffield's bat hit him on the follow-through. The seven-time
All-Star catcher sustained a slight concussion and a gash on his
forehead that required one stitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets said Piazza should be back in the lineup Friday when
the team returns home to play Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was hit by a liner off the bat of Edgardo Alfonzo and left
after six innings because of a bruised right leg. The ball was hit
so hard that it ricocheted into foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   Brown chased the ball down just outside the first-base line,
grabbed it with his bare hand and in the same motion whipped an
accurate sidearm throw to first base for the out -- while flying
toward the dugout and stumbling to regain his balance.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed one run and three hits and struck out five. His
injury occurred just hours after the Dodgers placed catcher Todd
Hundley on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained abdominal
oblique muscle in his right rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter's homer and RBI singles by Shawn Green and Eric Karros
gave the Dodgers a 3-1 lead against Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets tied it with two in the eighth against Alan Mills.
Kurt Abbott led off with his first homer of the season and Alfonzo,
who homered and had two RBIs, drove in pinch-runner Jon Nunnelly
with a double off the short fence in the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton gave up two earned runs and five hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brown was on the 15-day disabled list earlier this season
after breaking his finger attempting to bunt at Shea Stadium. ...
Hundley became the fourth Dodgers' regular to hit the DL this
season, joining CF Devon White, SS Elster and 3B Adrian Beltre. ...
Hampton got his ninth hit of the season on a dribbler up the
third-base line in the fifth. ... Los Angeles manager Davey Johnson
said he will give closer Jeff Shaw a few days off. Shaw, who blew a
save for the fifth time Tuesday night, has been pitching for two
weeks with a knot behind his right shoulder. ... Alfonzo has five
homers in 11 games.

<HEADLINE> Comets 93, Fire 89, 2OT  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes scored eight of her 29
points in the second overtime as the defending champion Houston
Comets held off the expansion Portland Fire 93-89 on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes hit all four of Houston's baskets in the second overtime
and assisted on the other, feeding center Tiffani Johnson for an
easy layup that gave the Comets an 89-87 lead with 23.5 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Swoopes intercepted a pass from Portland
center Alisa Burras and ran downcourt for a layup and a 91-87 lead
with 12.6 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire's Stacey Thomas drove for a layup to cut the lead to
two, but Cynthia Cooper made both free throws with 3.4 seconds left
to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   Houston didn't exactly look like a three-time defending WNBA
champion most of the way against the inexperienced Fire. The Comets
were outshot 43 percent to 40 percent and outrebounded 49-36.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, who shot 12-for-27, also had six rebounds and five
assists. Cooper added 22 points but shot just 6-for-23. Janeth
Arcain had 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Burras and Sophia Witherspoon, acquired in the expansion draft
from New York, led the Fire with 19 points each. Vanessa Nygaard
had 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire blew a chance to win in the final seconds of
regulation, then needed a driving layup by Tully Bevilaqua with 2.1
seconds left to tie it at 73.
</P>
<P>
   Nygaard missed two free throws with 40.3 seconds left, but after
Thomas rebounded, Nygaard followed another miss with a rebound and
bank shot to tie it at 71. Nygaard was fouled but missed the free
throw.
</P>
<P>
   That set up a 17-foot jumper by Swoopes with 7.9 seconds left.
Portland then inbounded at halfcourt, and Bevilaqua drove the
baseline for the tying basket.
</P>
<P>
   In the first overtime, the Comets needed an easy layup by Cooper
off an inbounds pass from Thompson to tie it at 81 with 6.6 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, coming off a season-opening 84-68 victory over the New
York Liberty on Monday, jumped to an early lead but struggled with
its outside shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets appeared to give themselves a cushion when Cooper's
hook shot capped a 15-3 run and opened up a 57-48 lead with 9:37 to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Portland fought back and tied it at 64 on a layup by Burras, and
the teams matched each other shot for shot until overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Burras, a husky 6-foot-3 reserve center who played for the
Cleveland Rockers last season and was third in the league in
field-goal percentage, made seven of her 12 shots and had eight
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who has won the WNBA scoring title all three years and
shot a team-high 46.3 percent last season, has made just 11 of her
38 shots in the first two games.

<HEADLINE> Padres 9, Brewers 5  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Damian Jackson's tiebreaking double was one of
four extra-base hits in the seventh inning for the San Diego
Padres, who blew a five-run lead and then rallied to beat the
Milwaukee Brewers 9-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres won their third straight series to finish the
homestand 7-2. They went 2-1 against the Brewers and the New York
Mets, and swept Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   David Weathers (3-2) allowed doubles by Carlos Hernandez,
Jackson and pinch-hitter Dave Magadan opening the seventh, then was
chased by Rivera's two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres drew 12 walks, three intentional, to tie the club
record for a nine-inning game. It was the third time they've had
that many, first since Sept. 7, 1980, against San Francisco. The 12
walks were two short of the Brewers' record, set April 29 against
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez doubled to the left-center gap, Jackson followed
with a double to right that hit a divot and took an odd hop past
Jeromy Burnitz, allowing Hernandez to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Almanzar (1-1) faced one batter for the win, getting Jose
Hernandez to ground into a force play to end the seventh with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Geoff Jenkins went 4-for-4 -- all singles -- to tie
his career high, drove in a run and scored once.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Lopez was trying to become the second San Diego pitcher
in as many nights to get his first major league victory, but once
again was burned by his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Lopez was making his fourth big league start. In
his debut on April 29 against Atlanta, he left with a 4-1 lead
after seven innings, only to watch the bullpen blow the lead and
the game as the Padres lost 7-4 in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres scored four runs in the fifth to stake Lopez to a 5-0
lead. Milwaukee came back with four in the sixth, the first three
allowed by Lopez, and reliever Brian Boehringer then allowed a
tying homer by the first batter he faced, Raul Casanova, leading
off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Casanova, a former Padres farmhand, homered to right on a 3-2
fastball. It was his first homer since July 16, 1998, against the
New York Yankees while he was with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, San Diego's Adam Eaton beat Milwaukee 6-3 in
his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres led 1-0 going into the fifth inning, when they scored
four runs on three hits and three walks. After leadoff batter Eric
Owens lined out to second, six straight Padres reached base. Phil
Nevin had an RBI single and Ryan Klesko an RBI double before Bret
Boone walked to load the bases and chase Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Woodard came on and walked Hernandez on four straight
pitches to force in a run, and Damian Jackson hit a sacrifice fly
to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' RBI single in the sixth chased Lopez, and reliever Matt
Whiteside allowed Jose Hernandez's RBI fielder's choice and Marquis
Grissom's two-run double to pull the Brewers to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee starter John Snyder walked seven and allowed five runs
-- four earned -- on four hits. He struck out two.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Brewers activated RHP Curtis Leskanic from the 15-day
disabled list and sent RHP Hector Ramirez outright to Triple-A
Indianapolis. Leskanic had been on the DL since May 17 with a groin
injury. ... Duane Espy made his debut as Padres hitting coach
Wednesday night. He replaces Ben Oglivie, who was demoted on
Tuesday to the Padres' team in the Arizona Rookie League. ...
Padres RHP Carlton Loewer is scheduled to make his second rehab
assignment Thursday at Single-A Rancho Cucamonga against San
Bernardino. Loewer broke his left ankle when he fell out of a deer
blind in January. He's expected to join the rotation in mid-June.

<HEADLINE> Federal panel approves NU, ConEd merger  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Connecticut's negotiations with Northeast
Utilities and Consolidated Edison reached an impasse Wednesday --
the same day the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave its
blessing to the merger of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The federal panel approved the proposed merger without comment
after the utilities allayed concerns about the effect it would have
on competition.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the companies pointed out they have already spun
off most of their power-generation assets in order to comply with
electric deregulation laws.
</P>
<P>
   NU sold its fossil fuel plants in Connecticut and Massachusetts
well above book value and has put its Millstone nuclear power
plants up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are particularly pleased with the speed in which FERC made
the approval as well as the findings in which FERC clearly stated
that the merger with ConEd will not affect competition or energy
pricing,'' said NU spokesman Terrence McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   The $7.5 billion deal would create the country's largest
electric and gas distribution company, with more than 6.4 million
customers in New York and New England.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders from both companies have already approved the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have also made assurances that customers will not
pay more for electricity as a result of the merger, according to
the regulatory commission's order approving the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The merger still needs approval from regulators in Connecticut,
New York and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings in Connecticut had begun but were cut short in favor of
negotiations after citizens groups complained the state was getting
nothing from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month Connecticut's Department of Public Utility
Control has been negotiating with the utilities over rate cuts, job
protections, corporate donations, land preservation and other
benefits for customers and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the utilities' deadline to file a settlement, ask
for regulatory proceedings to resume or ask to continue talks. No
agreement was reached and NU will ask that the merger hearings
continue, McIntosh said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings should start up again in two to three weeks,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state
will continue to push for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''When hearings resume at the DPUC, we will continue to oppose
the merger until Connecticut receives substantial benefits and
savings, and Connecticut's economy and work force are protected,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission must also approve the deal.

<HEADLINE> Tentative agreement reached to end month long walkout  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WETHERSFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- The American Red Cross and its blood
collection workers in Connecticut have reached a tentative
three-year contract agreement that would end a monthlong walkout.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came Wednesday, the 31st day of a strike by 200 members
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
Local 3145. The workers were seeking better pay and less hectic
work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would release details of the deal, saying they
wanted workers to hear the proposal first.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an improvement over the previous last best offer of the
Red Cross that compelled the strike,'' said Jeffrey Jump, chief
negotiator for the union.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the agreement was scheduled for Saturday. No date has
been set for employees to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased, looking forward to having our employees
back at their jobs,'' said Lynn Townshend, Red Cross spokeswoman.
''We're relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood collections in Connecticut have dropped to about 100 pints
per day from the usual 600. The Red Cross has been holding only one
blood drive each day, instead of the six to 12 it held before the
strike. The agency hopes to have a full complement of blood drives
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jump predicted the members would ratify the deal. The union's
negotiating committee is unanimously recommending the agreement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good about it, to say the least,'' Jump said. ''Every
issue has been addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jump thanked state and federal mediators for their help in
reaching an agreement, which came after a full day of negotiations
at the state Department of Labor in Wethersfield. He praised the
striking workers for maintaining solidarity throughout the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''The membership has been remarkable,'' Jump said. ''They have
really stuck this out and persevered.''
</P>
<P>
   Jump attributed the settlement to both sides showing
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Although no hospital reported any problems with blood delivery
or service because of the strike, a controversy arose after the
Connecticut AFL-CIO urged the union's 265,000 members to boycott
blood drives until the contract dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The union had had also asked the American Red Cross ''to cease
the transfer to Connecticut of blood from national inventories or
other centers around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Hospital Association called that move
irresponsible, and a threat to the blood supply.

<HEADLINE> Three inmates, injured in prison fire  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERS, Conn. (AP) -- Three inmates, including a man accused of
killing an East Hartford police officer, were injured in a fire at
the Northern Correctional Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The fire occurred at about 7:45 p.m. Wednesday in a unit of the
maximum-security prison that houses about 50 inmates, including the
six on Connecticut's death row, said Christina Polce, a Correction
Department spokeswoman. No death row inmates were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said that mattresses, books and paperwork were on
fire in a cell, but that the blaze did not spread beyond that cell.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was quite a bit of smoke,'' said Lt. Duane Drouin of the
Somers Volunteer Fire Department. ''The correction officers knocked
it down with fire extinguishers. But there was a small amount of
flame. It was still smoldering.''
</P>
<P>
   The injured included Alex Sostre, 25, who is awaiting trial on
capital felony and murder charges in the Jan. 23, 1999 shooting of
East Hartford Police officer Brian Aselton. Sostre suffered smoke
inhalation, but was expected to be treated and released from
Johnson Memorial Hospital, said Capt. Heather Ziemba, another
spokeswoman for the Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   Sostre's cellmate, identified as Pedro Poupart, suffered minor
burns and was expected to be transferred to the prison ward of the
John Dempsey Hospital in Farmington, Ziemba said. A third inmate,
identified as Julio Gomez, suffered minor smoke inhalation as was
being returned to Northern, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Poupart, 18, of New Haven, is serving 17 months for assault on a
police or fire officers. Gomez, 29, of Meriden, is serving three
years for violation of probation. His record includes burglary,
larceny and drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Johnson Memorial said four guards also were treated
for smoke inhalation. But prison officials said the guards were not
injured, and went to the hospital only to accompany the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The housing unit, known as One East, is reserved for inmates
with behavioral problems. Inmates in the unit are locked in their
cells 23 hours a day, Ziemba said. The residents were evacuated to
another section of the prison after the fire, but were being
returned to their cells early this morning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time was public safety, or the security of the facility
jeopardized,'' Polce said.
</P>
<P>
   The prison houses over 430 of Connecticut's worst offenders.
Polce said the facility's perimeter was ''secured and reinforced''
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The community was notified through a beeper system that
activates in times of emergency, Polce said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution witness grilled by defense in Peeler trial  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Josephine Lee, who has testified she
was the lookout when a gunman killed an 8-year-old witness and the
boy's mother, denied knowing anything about the killings in letters
she wrote to her former landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the state's star witness against Russell Peeler, originally
testified she overheard Peeler and his brother, Adrian, plan the
murders of Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke.
Lee also said she helped Adrian Peeler get into the Clarke house
and watched as he shot the mother and son on Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Peeler's defense attorneys confronted her with
two letters she wrote to her former landlord, Norman Williams, in
which she said she lied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norman you know that I lied on the Peelers. But I was scared
when the police came to the house to get me so I told them that I
had something to do with the murder. But I do not know anything,''
she wrote in a letter to Williams in May, just after she testified
against Russell Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke and her son in a
house owned by Williams, last year pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit murder. She agreed to testify against the Peeler brothers in
exchange for a maximum prison sentence of seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is accused of masterminding the murders to
prevent the boy from testifying against him in the 1998 slaying of
Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr. His brother, Adrian, is
accused of being the actual triggerman who killed the mother and
son.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Peeler's attorneys Wednesday, Lee said
she lied in her letters to Williams because she was hoping to live
in his house again when she is released from prison. She later
contradicted herself, however, saying she did not want to go back
to Williams' house.
</P>
<P>
   She insisted that she was telling the truth when she said she
overheard Russell Peeler ask his brother, Adrian, to kill the
mother and son. She also repeated her original story that she got
Adrian inside the Clarke housing by knocking on the door and
identifying herself as the girl who lived across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''This right here is a lie,'' she said, holding up one of the
letters she wrote to Williams. ''I'm telling the truth now,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Lee has changed her story.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee first testified as a prosecution witness, Peeler's
attorneys grilled her about a letter she wrote to her own attorney
in Dec. 1999 in which she denied knowing anything about the
killings. At the same time, she sent three separate letters to
Bridgeport police officers in which she said she asked forgiveness
for having a role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also called Williams as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a 75-year-old nicknamed ''Pops,'' said he did not see
Russell Peeler at his house the day before the murder,
contradicting Lee's earlier testimony that she overheard Russell
and Adrian planning the murders as they sat in Williams' house that
day.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said he did not see Adrian Peeler at his house the
day of the murders. Lee testified earlier that Adrian Peeler walked
into Williams' house holding a gun and that she brought him across
the street to Clarke's house with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you see Adrian with Josephine Lee with a gun in his
hand?'' Peeler's attorney, William Koch, asked Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way,'' Williams replied.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination from Bridgeport State's Attorney
Jonathan Benedict, Williams acknowledged that he and others who
stayed in his house had smoked crack cocaine. Lee testified that
Russell Peeler used Williams' kitchen to cook the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the case are scheduled for Friday. The jury
is expected to begin deliberations Monday after receiving
instruction on the law from the judge.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet With Barak  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- President Clinton is going into talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak with a ''much greater sense
of urgency'' created by the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. ''All
the balls are up in the air,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of today's meeting, a Palestinian official said
Israel has offered to withdraw from more than 90 percent of the
West Bank as part of a peace treaty. But an Israeli official said
the treaty would not resolve one of the most contentious issues --
the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   That will take more time, said Jerusalem Affairs Minister Haim
Ramon. In the meantime, he said, traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
would remain under total Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at a lookout that was the site of 1948 battles over
Jerusalem, Barak declared, ''The state of Israel and Jerusalem are
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see in the coming months if there is a real desire on
the other side to make an agreement and end the conflict,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are trying to agree
on the framework for a peace agreement by September.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli's pullout from Lebanon, which triggered waves of
violence in the area, was a daring move that heightened both
anxieties and expectations, Clinton told a news conference after a
meeting with European Union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has changed the landscape ... because things are up in the
air again,'' Clinton said. ''It also imposes a much greater sense
of urgency. ... I think the consequences of inaction are now likely
to be more difficult because of this move.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invited Barak to his hotel suite before heading to
Germany for the next leg of the president's weeklong European tour.
They had planned to meet later today in Berlin. But, due to a
scheduling conflict, the Israeli leader decided to come here
instead and to skip the Germany visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like there's some bombshell out there,'' Clinton said
ahead of today's session. ''We just really needed to have a
face-to-face meeting and we needed to do it in this timeframe.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Clinton were to meet last week in Washington. But the
crisis kept Barak at home.
</P>
<P>
   Today's session ''will make up for the meeting that we were
supposed to have,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He
said a real breakthrough seemed unlikely. ''This is more of an
attempt to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep
this moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called Arafat from Lisbon on Wednesday and they
talked for about 20 minutes, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Israeli withdrawal, Palestinians living in
Lebanon are understandably anxious, Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does this mean that there is going to be a peace and,
therefore, they will be able to have a better life ... or does this
mean that this is it and there is sort of a new freezing of the
situation? So there is anxiety in the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options being mentioned: A top-level, three-way
meeting in the United States akin to the Camp David sessions that
resulted in peace between Israel and Egypt in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lockhart said, ''Who knows as we go down the road what will
serve as an appropriate vehicle for coming to a final agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the president thanked the European Union for leading
efforts to give Israel an invitation to be represented on key U.N.
committees, marking a turning point in Israel's stormy relationship
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good development, and I think it will
contribute to the negotiating atmosphere that is so important at
this difficult and pivotal time in the Middle East,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Wednesday meeting with European Union leaders, Clinton
also said he sought to ease skepticism among allies over a proposed
U.S. nuclear missile shield by promising to share the technology
with all ''civilized nations.''
</P>
<P>
   If the technology is available, Clinton said in advance of his
first direct talks this weekend with Russian President Vladimir
Putin, ''it would be unethical,'' for the United States to do
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has opposed putting such a system in place, or modifying
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to make a decision before leaving office on whether
to go ahead with such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also discussed various trade disputes between the
United States and Europe, but reported no breakthroughs.

<HEADLINE> List Targets Top Drug Traffickers  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's newest weapon in
the drug war is a financial blacklist of major foreign drug
traffickers and their associates.
</P>
<P>
   Those on the drug kingpin list would have their U.S. assets
frozen in most cases. Americans would be barred from doing business
with them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was required to present the list to Congress
by today under a law passed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they (drug traffickers)are in the business for the money
and you tie up the money, you hit them where it hurts the most,''
said Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   But civil libertarians are concerned that assets will be seized
before foreign companies have a chance to defend themselves. Some
U.S. and foreign companies fear they will be penalized for
unwittingly doing business with traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   And Mexico is wary of the new law, known as the Foreign Drug
Kingpin Designation Act. Mexican officials and legislators have
raised their concerns in meetings with their U.S. counterparts in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Mexico City late Wednesday, the Mexican
foreign relations department repeated that it ''fully agrees with
the spirit of the law.'' But it expressed concerns about whether
foreign companies in the United States will be given due process of
law.
</P>
<P>
   It said it has ''demanded the necessary care so that the
political process before the U.S. Congress doesn't affect, with
unfounded charges, the prestige of innocent Mexican individuals or
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul D. Coverdell, who sponsored the legislation, said he
expects the ''angst'' about the list will calm down after its
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the list will be very conservative, probably by and
large people already under indictment in the United States,'' said
Coverdell, R-Ga. ''It will not be a long list.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that the first part of the
list -- the names of major drug traffickers -- was being reviewed
Wednesday by President Clinton in Lisbon, Portugal, where he was
meeting with European Union leaders. Those names will be released
today and the traffickers' assets will be frozen immediately, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The other part, naming the traffickers' business associates, was
being prepared by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control, but it was unclear when it would be made public.
Other names and businesses could be added later.
</P>
<P>
   The list could contain names of suspects who have been publicly
identified before, such as Alejandro Bernal Madrigal of Colombia,
the Arellano Felix brothers in Mexico, Wei Hsueh-kang, a Chinese
national, and former Myanmar warlord Khun Sa.
</P>
<P>
   Naming business associates has raised greater concerns. TMM, a
giant Mexican shipping company that has long fought rumors linking
it to drug trafficking, hired a Washington firm to lobby on its
behalf. TMM spokesman Luis Calvillo said the company is now
reassured that the U.S. government ''has taken the adequate steps
to make sure that innocents aren't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce is still troubled, though,
that any businesses linked to drug trafficking would have to fight
in federal court to clear their names.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't really enforce the concept of innocent until proven
guilty,'' said Jeff Sparshott, spokesman for the chamber in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law note that it was modeled after a 1995
executive order that gave the government the power to penalize
Colombian drug traffickers and their associates. Few due process
complaints have been raised over the blocking of Colombian assets,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a five-member commission has been formed to evaluate the
procedure of blocking assets and judicial remedies available to
anyone affected by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he expects U.S. companies will be warned if are
they doing business with foreign companies linked to drug
traffickers -- and will be expected to sever ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live in an environment today that institutions have to pay
attention to who their clients are,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian To Show Beltway Customs  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This national capital consists of more than
bureaucrats and whistle-blowers. It's home to at least 560,000
people, many of whom came from other parts of the country and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   That may help explain the popularity of the Smithsonian's annual
folk-life festival, which, according to its executive director,
Diana Parker, may attract as many as 1 million visitors to the
National Mall beginning June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful stands and pavilions will exhibit food, music, crafts
and pastimes, with large areas devoted to Tibetans and people who
live along the Rio Grande. There also will be exhibitions by a
basketball team of women over age 60.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has a large and growing Latino population.
Restaurants called French or Italian may be staffed largely by
people who come from El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a daily festival event called ''Washington, D.C.: It's Our
Home'' will have a distinctly Latin flavor. At a preview of the
festival Wednesday, Tony Gittens, executive director of the D.C.
Commission on Arts and Humanities, presented a band bravely named
Sin Miedo (Spanish for ''Without Fear''), playing with members of a
Brazilian group. The festival also will include demonstrations of
dress weaving for the quinceniera, the traditional coming-out
occasion for 15-year-old girls in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons will be available on how to make a pinata, the Mexican
package of paper or clay that spews candy when children hit it with
a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Gittens pointed out that many Washingtonians trace their origins
to the American rural South. Washington's highly urbanized 68
square miles include little farm land, but the festival will devote
an area on the Mall to gardening.
</P>
<P>
   A strong religious impulse will be represented by gospel blues
and blue grass, and by Jewish cantors, Yoruba ceremony from West
Africa, Koranic chants, Japanese and Cambodian melodies.
</P>
<P>
   Food will include Chesapeake Bay crab cakes and fried chicken as
well as a variety of ethnic foods: Panamanian snacks, Middle
Eastern bean pie, Senegalese cebujen -- fish and rice -- and Ghanaian
cooking. Pepper soup with goat meat over fufu is one local delicacy
promised.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere, thought Michael McBride, the arts specialist
coordinating all the research, will be a demonstration of the
healing arts practiced by native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which will take place June 23-27 and June 30-July
4, will end with the traditional Independence Day fireworks display
at the Washington Monument.

<HEADLINE> Scam Artists Pose as Census-Takers  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau and a consumer watchdog
group are warning people to look out for scam artists who may be
masquerading as census-takers, but are actually trying to trick
people into giving up Social Security and bank account numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt said he had heard reports of six
such scams going on around the country, but did not consider it a
serious threat to the success of the once-a-decade population
count.
</P>
<P>
   However, such scattered reports often are ''just the tip of the
iceberg,'' said Holly Cherico, spokeswoman for the Better Business
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is typical of scams in two ways -- it's tied to a timely
event that people remember, and it's trading on the legitimacy and
credibility of the federal government,'' Cherico said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, ranking Democrat on the House
Government Reform Committee's census panel, has asked the FBI to
investigate. Census officials say some of the calls appear to be
coming from a Baltimore-area phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ''They finally gave up. They said 'we understand we get a lot of
people who are reluctant, that you have a hard time doing this,'''
said Nicole Bennett, a Senate staffer on Capitol Hill, after
getting a similar call recently at home. ''We both disagreed, and
I'm not caustic or easily antagonized.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar warnings have also popped up in Arkansas, North Dakota,
and in northeastern Pennsylvania, where there is a higher number of
elderly residents.
</P>
<P>
   A census-taker will never ask for a Social Security and bank
account number at the door or over the phone. They also must wear a
Census Bureau identification badge and give you the number of your
local Census office so you can verify they are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Forms were sent out to 120 million households in March, and 78
million of them have been returned. In April, census-takers began
the 10-week task of trying to track down the missing 42 million.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Prewitt said that only about 10 million of
those homes had yet to be contacted, though those households will
be ''the most difficult yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remain uncounted include hard-to-reach inner-city
residents, anti-government people, and those concerned their
answers will not remain confidential, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau hopes an encouraging e-mail sent Wednesday
from President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to census-takers
will help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have to redouble our efforts to reach the remaining 8
percent of households, so that we can deliver to the country the
accurate and complete census it needs for the coming decade,''
Prewitt said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asked To Name Momuments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt wants
President Clinton to declare four new national monuments protecting
more than 500,000 acres of federal land in Washington state,
Oregon, Colorado and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton approves the request as expected he will have used
the Antiquities Act to protect nearly 3.7 million acres -- the
second most by a U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are priceless natural landscapes that have somehow
remained almost untouched by exploitation, development and urban
sprawl,'' Babbitt said Wednesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of the areas recommended today represents an exceptional,
irreplaceable piece of America's natural and cultural heritage,''
Clinton responded, also in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not what the Antiquities Act was intended for,''
complained Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. ''It was not designed for the
creation of another Yellowstone.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
criticized the Clinton administration for designating state land
for national monuments without close consultation with state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the sites in Babbitt's latest recommendation --
The Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington -- would protect
200,000 acres along 51 miles of the Columbia River that is one of
the largest, undisturbed river stretches in the United States and a
critical spawning ground for salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The other three monuments requested by Babbitt:
</P>
<P>
   --Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, 164,000 acres of
Bureau of Land Management land in Colorado that contains more than
20,000 archaeological sites -- the highest known density of such
sites in the nation. The site's remoteness has helped protect it,
but growing population and tourism requires more protection,
Interior officials said.
</P>
<P>
   --Ironwood Forest National Monument in Arizona, 134,750 acres of
BLM land, includes stands of ironwood trees that can live more than
800 years, along with blue palo verde and saguaro blanket stands.
The area needs protection because of urban expansion in the
southern part of the state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   --Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in Oregon, 52,000 acres of
BLM land, including Soda Mountain, is one of the most biologically
diverse areas in North America, home to 100 species of butterflies,
eight species of bats and old growth habitat important for the
threatened northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Antiquities Act allows presidents -- without
congressional approval -- to safeguard objects of historic and
scientific interest. President Theodore Roosevelt used the law to
set aside the Grand Canyon in 1908 and President Carter used it to
create large sections of Alaska wilderness in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   If he approves Babbitt's request, Clinton will have used the Act
to declare or expand 10 monuments during his presidency. Only
Carter has used the Act to protect more acreage, as he set aside 50
million acres in Alaska alone.

<HEADLINE> Hormone Helps Crohn Disease Patients  </HEADLINE>
By KATHARINE WEBSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Human growth hormone combined with a high-protein diet
significantly eased the symptoms of Crohn's disease in patients
with moderate to severe cases of the digestive disorder,
researchers reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Crohn's affects the digestive tract, causing persistent
diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding and breakdown of the intestinal
wall. About half of all Crohn's patients require surgery at some
point to remove intestinal obstructions or repair holes in the
bowel. There is no known cure, though drugs can ease symptoms in
some patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study in today's New England Journal of Medicine found that
11 of 19 adults treated with growth hormone while on a high-protein
diet went into remission. Three others saw significant improvement.
Eighteen patients taking a dummy drug while on a high-protein diet
saw no significant improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The study was supported by grants from Eli Lilly and the
Genentech Foundation for Growth and Development, a nonprofit that
gets funding from Genentech Inc. Both pharmaceutical companies make
growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1 million Americans suffer from Crohn's disease,
according to the Crohn's &AMP; Colitis Foundation of America. Up to
120,000 people are diagnosed with moderate to severe disease each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressing drugs can send
the disease into remission but do not prevent long-term relapse.
Others prevent relapse in some patients but do not make the disease
go into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the new study, Dr. Alfred Slonim of North Shore
University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said growth hormone causes
few harmful side effects in children and adolescents who take it
for years.
</P>
<P>
   If further studies find it is effective for long-term treatment
of Crohn's, it may prove safer than current remedies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Crohn's is unknown, but one theory is that
infections or hereditary factors weaken the intestinal wall, making
it more susceptible to inflammation and tissue breakdown when it
comes in contact with disease-causing organisms. An exaggerated
immune response may also play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Slonim's approach was based on earlier research that showed
growth hormone improved intestinal repair in patients who had part
of their bowels surgically removed. Slonim theorized that growth
hormone may rebuild and strengthen the intestinal wall. A
high-protein diet provides the building blocks for tissue repair.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 patients who improved, virtually all said their
abdominal pain disappeared. They also reported less diarrhea. Side
effects were mild. Ten patients reported some swelling and five had
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The study is provocative, but limited because of its small size,
Dr. Balfour Sartor of the University of North Carolina wrote in an
accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Growth hormone appeared almost as effective as the
anti-inflammatory drug infliximab, the only medication approved
specifically for Crohn's disease, Sartor said. However, Slonim's
group did not perform exams to see whether the intestinal tissue
was healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Another study in Thursday's journal found that the
anti-inflammatory drug methotrexate can keep severe symptoms at bay
in Crohn's patients who have previously responded well to that
medication.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 study led by Dr. Brian Feagan of the John P. Roberts
Research Institute in London, Ontario, found that 39 percent of
Crohn's patients went into remission when treated with 25 grams per
week of methotrexate.
</P>
<P>
   Feagan's latest study found that patients who continued to take
15 grams per week of methotrexate were less likely to relapse: 65
percent remained in remission, compared to 39 percent of patients
who got a dummy medication.

<HEADLINE> Viagra Said OK For Heart Patients  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Viagra caused no harmful changes in the blood flow of
men with
severe heart disease, researchers reported today in a study
financed by the maker of the impotence treatment drug.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The study in the New England Journal of Medicine added to
evidence that Viagra alone does not increase the risk of heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many men who are impotent also have heart disease, because the
risk factors are often the same: old age, diabetes, high blood
pressure and high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania measured blood
flow inside the coronary arteries of 14 men with severe narrowing
of at least one artery. They found no adverse cardiovascular
effects and a slight improvement in coronary blood flow reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra did lower the men's blood pressure slightly, as
previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra has been linked to an increased number of heart attack
deaths, mostly in patients who use it while taking nitrates,
because the combination can lead to a sudden, severe drop in blood
pressure. Sex also can increase the risk of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Howard Herrmann, of the University of
Pennsylvania. It was supported by a grant from Pfizer, which makes
Viagra.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meeting With Barak  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- President Clinton met today with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to discuss Middle East peace, a process
Clinton says has taken on ''a much greater sense of urgency'' with
the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders met in Clinton's hotel suite here as the
president prepared to leave Portugal for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of today's hastily arranged meeting, a Palestinian
official said Israel has offered to withdraw from more than 90
percent of the West Bank as part of a peace treaty. But an Israeli
official said the treaty would not resolve one of the most
contentious issues -- the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   That will take more time, said Jerusalem Affairs Minister Haim
Ramon. In the meantime, he said, traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
would remain under total Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at a lookout that was the site of 1948 battles over
Jerusalem, Barak declared, ''The state of Israel and Jerusalem are
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see in the coming months if there is a real desire on
the other side to make an agreement and end the conflict,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are trying to agree
on the framework for a peace agreement by September.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli's pullout from Lebanon was a daring move that heightened
both anxieties and expectations, Clinton told a news conference
after a meeting with European Union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has changed the landscape ... because things are up in the
air again,'' Clinton said. ''It also imposes a much greater sense
of urgency. ... I think the consequences of inaction are now likely
to be more difficult because of this move.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invited Barak to his hotel suite before heading to
Germany for the next leg of the president's weeklong European tour.
They had planned to meet later today in Berlin. But, due to a
scheduling conflict, the Israeli leader decided to come here
instead and to skip the Germany visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like there's some bombshell out there,'' Clinton said
ahead of today's session. ''We just really needed to have a
face-to-face meeting and we needed to do it in this timeframe.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Clinton were to meet last week in Washington. But the
crisis kept Barak at home.
</P>
<P>
   Today's session ''will make up for the meeting that we were
supposed to have,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He
said a real breakthrough seemed unlikely. ''This is more of an
attempt to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep
this moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called Arafat from Lisbon on Wednesday and they
talked for about 20 minutes, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Israeli withdrawal, Palestinians living in
Lebanon are understandably anxious, Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does this mean that there is going to be a peace and,
therefore, they will be able to have a better life ... or does this
mean that this is it and there is sort of a new freezing of the
situation? So there is anxiety in the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options being mentioned: A top-level, three-way
meeting in the United States akin to the Camp David sessions that
resulted in peace between Israel and Egypt in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lockhart said, ''Who knows as we go down the road what will
serve as an appropriate vehicle for coming to a final agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the president thanked the European Union for leading
efforts to give Israel an invitation to be represented on key U.N.
committees, marking a turning point in Israel's stormy relationship
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very good development, and I think it will
contribute to the negotiating atmosphere that is so important at
this difficult and pivotal time in the Middle East,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Wednesday meeting with European Union leaders, Clinton
also said he sought to ease skepticism among allies over a proposed
U.S. nuclear missile shield by promising to share the technology
with all ''civilized nations.''	   If the technology is available, Clinton said
in advance of his
first direct talks this weekend with Russian President Vladimir
Putin, ''it would be unethical,'' for the United States to do
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has opposed putting such a system in place, or modifying
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to make a decision before leaving office on whether
to go ahead with such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also discussed various trade disputes between the
United States and Europe, but reported no breakthroughs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bandleader and percussionist Tito Puente, who
rode to fame on the heels of the 1950s mambo craze and for the next
five decades helped define Latin jazz, has died. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Puente, who was recently treated for a heart problem, died at
NYU Medical Center in New York, his agent, Eddie Rodriguez, said
today.
</P>
<P>
   Puente recorded more than 100 albums in his more than 60 years
in the business. He won his fifth Grammy in February for best
traditional tropical Latin performance for ''Mambo Birdland'' and
has been nominated for the award 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Puente brought the timbales, a pair of single-headed drums
mounted on stands and played with sticks, from behind the band to
the front of the bandstand and played standing up.
</P>
<P>
   ''In front of a bandstand you've got to be a showman,'' Puente
says. ''Once, I was strictly a musician with a long face and back
to the audience. Now I'm a showman, selling what I'm doing, giving
the people good vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also loved playing vibraphone. ''I have a nice following of
people who love my vibe playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Puente joked that he profited off the talent of Santana, whose
early hits include Puente's ''Oye Como Va.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time he plays 'Oye Como Va,' I get a nice royalty
check,'' Puente said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The excitement of the rhythms and the beat make people
happy,'' he said in a 1997 Associated Press interview. ''We try to
get our feelings to the people, so they enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not music for a funeral parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, RMM Records released a three-CD, 50-song compilation
from Puente's recorded output through 50 years. It's titled ''50
Years of Swing.'' The first cut, ''Que No, Que No,'' is from his
''El Rey del Mambo'' (''The King of the Mambo'') recording of 1946.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most successful albums of the '50s was ''Puente Goes
Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some jazz bands, like Kenton's, had added Latin rhythms,''
Puente told an interviewer in 1957. ''It sounded good to me. So I
figured I might as well do the same thing, in reverse. I start off
writing a straight jazz arrangement, then I just add a Latin rhythm
section.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same reason kids like rock 'n' roll. It has the beat.
I think bop, which neglected rhythm and neglected dancers, did a
lot to kill big bands.''
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son of Puerto Rican parents, Puente was born Ernest
Anthony Puente Jr. in New York City on April 20, 1923. (Some
references give other years.)
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ernest Sr., was a foreman in a razor-blade factory.
His mother called her son Ernestito, Little Ernest, then shortened
the name to Tito.
</P>
<P>
   It was his mother who first discerned his musical talent and
enrolled him in a piano class when he was 7. Puente studied drums
for years before switching to timbales. He studied conducting,
orchestration and theory at the Juilliard School from 1945 to '47
on the GI Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Puente had been released from a San Juan, Puerto Rico, hospital
May 2 after two days of treatment for an irregular heartbeat.
Puente canceled all his events in May, including three concerts
planned with the Symphonic Orchestra of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I play in jazz festivals all over the world,'' he said in
1997. ''Next year I'm going to China and Russia. Our Latin sounds
are really spreading out.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as I have my health, I'll continue to work as long as
I can,'' he said. ''I may have to slow down next year a little, get
to the semiretirement stage. But there are a couple of things I
want to do first.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB Tests TWA 800 Missile Theory  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with nagging theories that TWA Flight
800 was brought down by a missile, federal investigators last month
test-fired missiles to determine just what witnesses might have
been able to see on the night of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 crash off the coast of Long Island, N.Y., that killed
230 people is believed to have resulted from an explosion of the
Boeing 747's center fuel tank and no evidence of a missile has ever
been found.
</P>
<P>
   But eyewitness reports of streaks of light seen nearby on the
night of the crash have continued to plague investigators and to
fuel ongoing conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to determine what might have been visible,
investigators arranged for the test firings of Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles last month at Eglin Air Force Base in
Florida, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Paul
Schlamm said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A final report on the results won't be complete for a few weeks,
he said, and any analysis will not be released until the board
meets in August to analyze the crash and try to determine a final
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The tests have been described as ''dotting the i's and crossing
the t's and that's a good way of looking at it,'' Schlamm said. He
quoted other board staff members as stressing that the tests should
not be construed as indicating that there are any new findings in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Schlamm said the test firings were done in similar weather and
lighting conditions to those on July 17, 1996, when the disaster
occurred just after the plane left New York.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous witnesses saw streaks of light in the sky that night,
but investigators have said they have no physical evidence of a
bomb or missile. Some investigators have speculated that the
streaks might have been caused by burning debris from the plane
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the crash, the board determined that the plane's
nearly empty center fuel tank exploded, but they have not
determined a source of ignition. One possibility that has been
discussed is electrical wiring passing near or through the fuel
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Schlamm said that during the investigation, NTSB workers and
others were going through summaries of witness statements provided
by the FBI. The question arose as to what could possible be seen,
he said, so the tests were done.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 94; Dow Up 35  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as investors took
heart in the latest signs that rising interest rates are
successfully keeping inflation at bay. Buyers dipped into the
technology sector, snapping up shares of market leaders that have
been battered in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 35.29 at 10,557.62.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 12.28 at 1,432.88, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 94.18 at 3,495.09.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market higher today. Qualcomm rose
$3.375 to $69.75 and PMC-Sierra rose $9 to $162.25.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $2.688 to $65.25. The company has asked for extra
time to formulate a breakup plan should a federal judge order the
company to divest its Windows operating systems business.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer rose $1.375 to $45.938. A study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine found that Pfizer's impotence treatment
drug Viagra caused no harmful changes in the blood flow of men with
severe heart disease. Pfizer financed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch added Pfizer to its ''Focus 1'' list of highly
recommended stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The market has gained strength in the past few sessions as a
string of economic reports have suggested that the runaway pace of
the nation's economic growth is slowing a bit. This morning, many
of the nation's retailers reported lackluster sales for May,
indicating that six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve
are beginning to quell consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the National Association of Purchasing Management issued
a report that showed growth in the industrial economy slowed during
May.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say the most crucial report will be the Labor
Department's May employment report, due out before the start of
trading Friday. Any signs of slower growth -- whether in a higher
unemployment rate or lower wage pressures -- should enable the
market to extend its efforts to rally.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 118.47 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.05 to 483.23.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market drew strength from overseas markets, which were

<HEADLINE> FCC Change Will Reduce Phone Bills  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting in July, all U.S. households should
see savings on their phone bills, with reductions as high as 50
percent for those who don't make any long-distance calls. Moderate
to heavy long-distance users can expect to see more modest
decreases.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions will result from a dramatic overhaul of the phone
subsidy system that was devised by the industry and adopted by the
Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission cut by $3.2 billion the ''access fees'' that
local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect
calls -- costs that typically are paid by phone users. Long-distance
companies have pledged to pass on the savings, meaning their
customers should see lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Low-volume callers would see the most immediate benefits, with
their bills dropping $3 to $4 a month. Those who make a moderate or
large amount of calls may only see small reductions in the
short-run, but stand to gain from falling long-distance rates or
price wars that the new plan could trigger, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to affect everyone differently, but overall,
everyone is going to benefit from this plan,'' FCC Chairman William
Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should begin seeing the changes in their July
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also would see some reductions in their monthly
charges, although it is unclear just how much they would save.
Typically, businesses, which make a large volume of long-distance
calls, have benefited from access charge reductions with lower
per-minute fees as well.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have sliced access charges by several billion dollars
over the past few years to better reflect local phone companies'
connection costs. But Wednesday's reduction is the most dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's action implements an industry proposal offered by
long-distance carriers AT&AMP;T and Sprint and major local phone
companies Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the plan is a major step in moving the
long-distance business toward the trend of flat-rate pricing for a
package of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably the trend of the future,'' said John Nakahata,
spokesman for the industry coalition. ''This will allow those types
of plans to proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates warn that for Americans to realize the
full benefits of the FCC's action, long-distance companies must
drop their rates for middle-range callers, such as those who make
up to 60 minutes of calls a month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's success depends on whether ''long-distance companies
deliver on their promise to pass through the savings with rate
reductions,'' said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom, which did not sign onto the plan, said that based on
FCC data, it believes the plan ultimately will result in higher
rates for customers and additional revenue for the regional Bell
phone companies. U S West also did not join the industry coalition,
even though it must abide by the FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday's action, AT&AMP;T pledged to eliminate a
minimum $3 monthly charge for residential customers on their most
basic calling plans, since some consumers make calls totaling less
than that amount. Sprint agreed to do the same. WorldCom already
has a no-minimum plan.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T basic rate customer who makes 10 minutes of
long-distance calls a month would pay $6.87 a month under the new
system, down from $9.39 a month the customer was paying before, for
a savings of $2.52 a month. A person who makes no calls would pay
$4.68, compared with $9.39 before, for a savings of $4.71 each
month, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The person who makes no long-distance calls benefits both from
the elimination of the minimum monthly charge and from no longer
being assessed the so-called universal service fee by the
long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   More than 41 percent of long-distance users make 10 minutes or
less in calls each month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also folds together and reduces two flat-rate charges
now on monthly bills. One, known as the subscriber line charge,
covers the cost of the phone line from the local phone company into
the home and is capped at $3.50 a month. A second pays for
long-distance companies' use of the local phone network. It now
averages about $1.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
   These two costs will be consolidated and reduced to $4.35. It
rises to $5 next July.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, who have been indirectly paying to keep phone service
affordable for low-income people and those in high-cost areas, will
see these universal service charges spelled out separately in their
monthly bill. The fee, a percentage of their long-distance calls,
will go to a $650 million fund.
</P>
<P>
   A separate fee from their local phone company, averaging about
36 cents, will also be used to keep phone service affordable.

<HEADLINE> First Castaway Leaves 'Survivor'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sonja, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   Kindly Sonja -- a 60-ish musician who proved not quite as spry as
her fellow ''Survivor'' castaways -- was sent packing at the end of
the CBS reality series' premiere Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go get 'em, you guys,'' she said after being voted out,
gracious even in exile.
</P>
<P>
   That left 15 in this endurance contest, which was staged on a
primitive island off Borneo and is being aired by CBS in a survival
effort against ABC's smash quiz ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   By this summer's 13th installment, just one survivor will remain
and be $1 million richer. And maybe CBS will have itself a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Based on early returns, CBS probably has a hit on its hands. The
show drew an estimated audience of between 17 million and 18
million, with the best ratings for any regularly-scheduled CBS show
in its time slot in two years, according to Nielsen Media
Research's overnight measurement in 48 major markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' didn't quite beat ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' but finished only 6 percent behind the game show
hit.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for CBS, the show's audience grew as the hour
went on -- a strong sign that curious viewers weren't turning away,
said Marc Berman, a ratings analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a tremendous start,'' Berman said, ''better
than anyone might have expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first-night ''Survivor'' audience need not fret
over Sonja's banishment. Next week (which will cover another three
days in the 39-day ordeal taped earlier this year), viewers will
find the other characters marooned right where they left them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the carefully selected ''tribesmen,'' truck driver Susan
will likely still be squabbling with Richard, a corporate trainer.
And Rudy, a retired Navy SEAL, should still be bossing everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they listened to me,'' Rudy told the camera on the first
show, ''they'd all have haircuts. We'd be in formation in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, next week, the next person will be voted out at a
torch-lit tribal council. And then there will be 14.
</P>
<P>
   After months of buildup, ''Survivor'' may surprise viewers by
resisting the salacious or even sinister tone some were expecting.
With the motto ''Outwit, Outplay, Outlast,'' the show focuses on
roughing it in beautiful surroundings -- and on interpersonal
gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The diverse group (which is split into two rival camps) harbors
distinct personalities that, if not always likable, are generally
involving. A few, like biochemist Ramona and Sean, the doctor with
a nipple ring, are also easy on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant more interesting than the show's producers might
have preferred is Richard Hatch. Last month, he pleaded innocent to
allegations he abused his 9-year-old son. The boy said he was
forced to go running and his father wrapped his hands around his
neck to move him along when he tired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm good to go, survival-wise,'' Hatch confidently told
Wednesday's ''Survivor'' audience. ''People-wise, it'll be a little
more challenging. But I've got the million-dollar check written
already.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual winner, whose identity CBS is jealously guarding, is
yet to be uncovered.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 109; Nasdaq Jumps 135  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today as investors took
heart in the latest signs that rising interest rates are
successfully keeping inflation at bay. Buyers dipped into the
technology sector, snapping up shares of market leaders that have
been battered in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 109.31 at 10,631.64.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 24.20 at 1,444.80, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 135.75 at 3,536.66.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market higher today. Qualcomm rose
$2.813 to $69.188 and PMC-Sierra rose $10.563 to $163.813.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard soared $10 to $130.125 following upbeat
projections made at the company's semiannual meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $2.50 to $65.063. The company has asked for extra
time to formulate a breakup plan should a federal judge order the
company to divest its Windows operating systems business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Rick Sherlund said today the stock
may be able to recover some ''lost ground'' after the judge rules
and the lengthy appeal process gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 'quiet time' in which there is not much new news on the
lawsuit could enable sentiment to improve a bit,'' Sherlund told
clients. Sherlund, among Wall Street's most influential Microsoft
analysts, has triggered several shifts in the stock's performance
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer rose $1.375 to $45.938. A study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine found that Pfizer's impotence treatment
drug Viagra caused no harmful changes in the blood flow of men with
severe heart disease. Pfizer financed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch added Pfizer to its ''Focus 1'' list of highly
recommended stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The market has gained strength in the past few sessions as a
string of economic reports have suggested that the runaway pace of
the nation's economic growth is slowing a bit. This morning, many
of the nation's retailers reported lackluster sales for May,
indicating that six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve
are beginning to quell consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the National Association of Purchasing Management issued
a report that showed growth in the industrial economy slowed during
May. The report also said inflationary pressures for industrial
supplies appear to have peaked in March.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say the most crucial report will be the Labor
Department's May employment report, due out before the start of
trading Friday. Any signs of slower growth -- whether in a higher
unemployment rate or lower wage pressures -- should enable the
market to extend its efforts to rally.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 300.66 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.49 to 485.67.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market drew strength from overseas markets, which were
almost uniformly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.2
percent.

Baptist leader denounces House bill
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Two of the nation's largest Protestant
churches have denounced the House vote for permanent, normalized
trade status with China.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev Richard Land, a leader of the Southern Baptist
Convention, said the bill would give the communist regime ''a free
hand to continue and increase its pattern of persecution of
Christians and other people of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thom White Wolf Fassett of the United Methodist Church
also opposes permanent trade status, along with 18 of the
denomination's bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world cannot have one standard of human rights for
apartheid South Africa and another for an authoritarian Chinese
state merely because China is a bigger trading partner or a larger
military threat,'' Fassett said at a Washington rally.
</P>
<P>
   Baptist Press reported that Land, president of the
denomination's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, was
dismayed that the House rejected advice from the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom, recently established by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's first report, on May 1, said China's performance on
religious rights had worsened this past year and that it should not
get permanent trade status until its record improved.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sent to the Senate calls for a new panel to monitor
China's human rights and trade practices.
</P>
<P>
   Other religious critics included such conservative groups as the
Family Research Council, Focus on the Family and Concerned Women
for America.

AJC pulls Mandela award
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The American Jewish Committee indefinitely
postponed plans to honor former South African President Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bandler, a committee spokesman, declined to discuss
reasons for canceling the May 19 ceremony. He said the AJC hopes to
reschedule it sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to the Nobel Peace Prize winner told reporters that
Mandela assumes his views on Iran were behind it. He had declared
that an espionage spy trial of 13 Jews in Iran was ''free and
fair'' and he opposed interference from other governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Jews, including the chief rabbi of Shiraz, were
charged with spying for Israel, but the AJC maintains they were
arrested simply for practicing their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite assurances from diplomatic sources that they would
receive a fair trial, the detainees have been denied legal
representation of their own choice and are being tried by a closed
Iranian revolutionary court,'' the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense rested its case for 10 of the defendants in Shiraz
May 29.

A few more seminarians
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Roman Catholic seminarians in
graduate-level training for the priesthood increased 4 percent this
academic year, according to data compiled by the Center for Applied
Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   The data from 46 schools showed 3,474 seminarians, compared with
3,344 for 1998-99. They are closely watched due to the increasing
shortage of U.S. priests.
</P>
<P>
   The high point for graduate enrollment was 8,159 in 1967-68.

Religious giving on the rise
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Giving to religious causes reached $81.78
billion in 1999, according to an annual estimate from the American
Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Religion was by far the largest category in U.S. philanthropy,
with 43 percent of the $190 billion total. It also posted the
largest numerical increase, $4.29 billion, over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Education, including some religious-backed institutions, was the
No. 2 beneficiary with $27.46 billion, up $2.14 billion over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, charity represented 1.8 percent of Americans' personal
incomes and 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product.

Bibles, book covers cause school grief
</P>

against the Willis Independent School District, claiming it
violated the federal and state constitutions by denying several
students freedom of religion and speech.

   In one case, the group charged, Sara Flotman, a middle school
teacher, tossed the Bibles of two students into a trash can,
saying, ''This is trash.'' The plaintiffs are Angela Harbison, 15,
and her sister, Amber, 13. The lawsuit also claims the school
district told three students to remove book covers with the Ten
Commandments printed on them. One of those students, Jeremy Pasket,
and his parents, also are plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Houston by the
Florida-based Liberty Counsel. Willis school district officials
declined comment, saying they had yet to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Mat Staver, the plaintiffs' attorney, said the lawsuit ''seeks
to educate the educators. Despite their misguided beliefs, the
Constitution is still the law of the land.''

Trooper wants no part of casino
</P>
<P>
   BREMEN, Ind. (AP) -- An Indiana state trooper fired in April
because he refused a post inside a casino on religious grounds,
wants his job back.
</P>
<P>
   When Ben Endres Jr., an eight-year veteran of the force and a
Baptist, turned down the plainclothes assignment at the Blue Chip
Casino in Michigan City, his superiors said troopers can't pick
which laws to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about him refusing a direct order from the
superintendent,'' said state police spokesman Lt. Steve Hillman.
</P>
<P>
   Endres' defense: ''We're going to answer to the Lord some day
for our actions. I would much rather answer to Him and have Him
tell me what I did was right than do what police Superintendent
(Mel) Carraway tells me.''
</P>
<P>
   Endres is appealing his case to the State Police Board, a
civilian appeals group. He also has filed a complaint with the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Endres said he offered to take another assignment or a transfer
because he believed that to work at the casino is to be involved in
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're part of the process. You're there to facilitate it, to
regulate it and enforce the regulations of it. And that involves me
in the process of it,'' he said. ''This job isn't about protecting
anybody other than the state of Indiana getting their money from
the gambling boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillman said the department has worked in the past to
accommodate troopers' religious beliefs. ''But there is a point the
department cannot go past, and this is an example of that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- In 72 years as a nun, Sister Grace
Marie Korn has spent uncounted hours sending prayers to God. For
the next year, she will pray on Joyce Fink's behalf as part of an
unusual fund-raising campaign that invites members of the public to
''adopt'' her and other sisters in her order.
</P>
<P>
   A cash gift will keep donors in their adoptees' prayers for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not praying for pay,'' stressed Sister Grace Marie, 91, a
member of the Williamsville Franciscan Sisters whose Adopt-A-Sister
program is just getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the sisters hope to develop lasting personal
relationships with those who adopt them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just 'so I add one more person in my prayers,' but a
more personal type of being there for another individual,'' said
Sister Marcella Nacreiner, communications director for the
Buffalo-area order.
</P>
<P>
   Donors can pledge any amount, and the nuns continue to pray for
anyone who asks, whether or not they pay.
</P>
<P>
   Adopt-A-Sister is part of a $3.7 million fund-raising effort
that the 130-member Sisters of St. Francis have launched to help
pay for the $12 million St. Mary of the Angels Motherhouse they
moved into six months ago. The site houses the order's
administrative offices, housing for active sisters and assisted
living and skilled nursing space for elderly and infirm nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Praying for others is nothing new to the nuns, who for
generations have honored requests for intentions and accepted
donations. The Adopt-A-Sister program links the practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout our history we have been women of prayer. We've had
people calling in or stopping in to say 'please pray for my
daughter who's having surgery, my son who's looking for
employment,' whatever,'' said Sister Bea Leising. ''This is kind of
a continuation of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Williamsville order came up with the idea during a
brainstorming session, the program is similar to one started
several years ago by the Salesian Sisters of North Haledon, N.J.,
who have raised more than $1 million toward a new retirement home.
A few other orders have similar programs, the Williamsville sisters
said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as donors don't mistakenly assume they are buying the
grace of God or that God's favor is for sale, the program could be
beneficial for everyone, said the Rev. Richard Neuhaus, a Catholic
priest and editor of ''First Things,'' a magazine about religion in
public life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody in their life of prayer has some means of selection,
if you will, that's inevitable,'' he said. ''In this case,
obviously they have a need and they're saying, 'Help us build this
new motherhouse and we'll do what we sisters do best, we'll pray
for you.' It seems to me that's a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Grace Marie, the first member of the order to be adopted,
prays for Fink during her daily 11 a.m. visits to the Chapel of
Adoration.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of my activities I guess maybe prohibit me from spending
that many hours in prayer so it's wonderful to have that,'' said
Fink, a retired public affairs director at Buffalo State College
who is on the board organizing the sisters' fund appeal. She
donated $500 to adopt Sister Grace Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, her adopted sister and others like her have
spent hours a day for decades in prayer. ''We figure they have a
system and it's probably working so I hope it works for me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship goes beyond prayer, she said. ''There's a
spiritual bonding where Grace Marie and I can sit and talk and she
can give me a spiritual book to go read and things like that,''
Fink said, ''so there are other dimensions to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationships can be as personal as the donors wish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had someone call and say, 'I really want somebody I can come
in and sit down and talk with because I'd like them to be praying
for my children and I want to share that with them,''' Leising
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those adopting a sister are sent a picture of her with her
address, phone number, birthday and a profile. Donors may choose a
sister or have one assigned. While any sister can be adopted, the
program is geared toward the older members of the order who have
more time to devote to prayer. There is no limit to the number of
times a sister can be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns received about 20 inquiries in the first days of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a desire on the part of the public for this
type of program,'' Nacreiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Leising, ''One woman said 'This is good. Now I can have
someone beside myself praying for me.'''

<HEADLINE> Holly Hunter Praised for 'Harlan'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Holly Hunter responded to the idea of ''Harlan
County War'' the same way viewers might on first hearing about it:
What, again?
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was being asked to star in a drama about a Kentucky coal
miner's wife; a year-long labor strike; danger, poverty and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Barbara Koppel had made that amazing documentary'' -- the
Oscar-winning ''Harlan County, U.S.A.'' about the real-life mining
strike of 1973-74 -- ''so I kind of went, 'What for? Koppel's done
it,''' Hunter says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then,'' she goes on, ''I read the script, and I wanted to say
the words out loud. That's always a signal that I'm very, very
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many scripts she reads, too many are set in her native
South. ''And that Southern material is almost always lousy,'' she
says. ''It's almost always inauthentic to me. The dialogue sounds
canned and the people are stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in this case,'' she happily reports, ''I thought the
writing had an incredible integrity and the dialogue was
impeccable.''
</P>
<P>
   So off she headed last fall to Toronto (Toronto!) to make the
film, which is set in the backwoods of Appalachian coal country a
quarter-century ago. Directed by Tony Bill from the screenplay by
Peter Silverman, it premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   A touching, human portrait of a hardscrabble life, ''Harlan
County War'' swallows Hunter whole as she becomes Ruby Kincaid, the
strong, devoted wife of Silas, played by Ted Levine, who similarly
vanishes into his character.
</P>
<P>
   As Hunter discovered when she first read the screenplay, the
part of Ruby -- spirited and wry of wit -- nearly leaps off the page.
Not so Silas, who in a lesser actor's hands would come across as
little more than a 'shine-swilling victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ted's part was not there in the script, man,'' says Hunter,
savoring how Levine turned a hirsute shell into flesh-and-blood.
''It was a beautiful thing to watch him work.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing the dramatic triangle is Stellan Skarsgard as Warren
Jakopovich, the union organizer who, with his quiet intensity,
arouses Ruby to the struggle, and (shades of ''Norma Rae'') other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Jakopovich first encounters Ruby knee-deep in chores -- and
suspicious of his call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're just gonna sit around,'' he presses her, ''and let the
company do what they want?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sit around?'' Ruby snaps. ''I got tah clean a house that don't
never get clean, cook up for supper, keep my young-uns from fallin'
down a mine pit, and it'd tickle the heck outta me if you'd let me
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back on scenes like that, Hunter marvels at the speech
patterns she was called upon to mimic. ''It's incredibly musical,''
she says over tea at her Manhattan hotel. ''And it was far harder
than I thought it was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the character she plays, Hunter is a tangy brew.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-2, she combines a pixieish frame with a towering
presence.
</P>
<P>
   She is winsome one moment (''Ah, you're making me blush,'' she
says when told she looks unglamorously lovely in the film).
</P>
<P>
   The next moment, she is suffer-no-fools direct: ''I don't work
nearly as much as I'd like. No way, man. My choice is not to do
pure, unadulterated (crap). I'd much rather be home, walking my
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   These opposing forces serve her well as Ruby, just as they have
throughout two decades of diverse roles. (Compare her TV producer
in ''Broadcast News'' to her Oscar-winning performance as a mute
Scotswoman of the 19th century in ''The Piano.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter, who grew up on a farm outside Atlanta, has tapped
straight into her Southernness for numerous projects, from the
stage production and film of ''Miss Firecracker'' to the feature
''The Firm'' to the HBO cable movie ''The Positively True
Adventures of the Alleged Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter left Georgia a quarter-century ago, but she has never
relinquished her stake (nor the tell-tale twang in her voice).
</P>
<P>
   ''The South carries a tremendous burden of heritage, and danger,
and drama, that a lot of places don't carry,'' she says.
''Southerners have a grand view of their lives, a way of looking at
their day with enormity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter currently lives in Hollywood with her husband of five
years, Janusz Kaminski (a cinematographer who won an Academy Award
for ''Saving Private Ryan''), and their Belgian sheepdog, Larry.
But the place she misses most is New York City and she pledges,
''We'll live here again.''
</P>
<P>
   She first moved to Manhattan in 1980 and, even for a girl
steeped in Southern politesse, she never saw New Yorkers as
off-putting. ''I find them to be very accessible, incredibly alert,
and of the world,'' she declares.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they're always ready to express their opinion. ''I kinda
like that,'' says Hunter, flashing an impish,
as-if-you-couldn't-tell kind of smile.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   CRYSTAL-CLEAR DIRECTION: Actor Billy Crystal will direct the HBO
Films production ''61,'' the true story of the pursuit of Babe
Ruth's home-run record by New York Yankees stars Roger Maris (Barry
Pepper) and Mickey Mantle (Thomas Jane). The film's title refers to
the year that baseball commissioner Ford Frick attached an asterisk
to Maris' single-season home run record. By 1961, the American
League had expanded its season from the 154 games played in Ruth's
day, adopting a 162-game schedule. Frick ruled that there would
have to be a ''distinctive mark'' to show that it had taken Maris
162 games to break the record that Ruth had set in 154 games during
the 1927 season. The film, starting production later this month,
will debut on HBO next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants To Boost British Flights  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U. S. and British negotiators are about to
resume talks on liberalizing air travel between the countries and
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater is seeking a deal by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Flights between the countries are limited by a 1977 treaty and
the governments have been at odds for years over how to ease those
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday on a conference call from London, Slater said
formal negotiations are scheduled to resume June 12 and the United
States wants a ''comprehensive and liberalized aviation agreement
concluded by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater said he is seeking a ''more competitive and open
environment'' including increased access for U.S. carriers to
London's popular Heathrow Airport as well as increased flights
between the countries for both American and British carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said the recently announced plan for United Airlines to
take over US Airways does not muddy the waters in these
discussions, although it is another item to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has been one of the most vocal U.S. carriers in
seeking more trans-Atlantic flights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're interested in hearing how that (the merger) might be
viewed here,'' Slater commented.
</P>
<P>
   As to the proposed merger itself, Slater said he met last week
with officials of both United and US Airways, as well as the new DC
Air, a proposed spinoff of US Airways that would fly from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is just so much we can say about it while we look at it
and work with Justice'' in reviewing the proposed merger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clear they had anticipated some of the challenges they
will face,'' he added about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the British-U.S. talks, Slater noted an effort by
British Airways, which dominates flights into Heathrow, to protect
its markets.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, British Midland is seeking international service,
British Virgin wants to expand the flights it now has to the United
States and many U.S. airlines are interested in breaking into the
trans-Atlantic market.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are trying to do is create, with the British, the most
comprehensive, forward and far-reaching agreement possible,''
Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1977 Bermuda II treaty, U.S. and British carriers each
are limited to 21 daily flights between the countries. Negotiations
to expand the treaty broke down in January.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Court Convicts Kurd Leader  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A Turkish court on Thursday sentenced the
leader of the only legal pro-Kurdish party to one year in prison
for suggesting the formation of an independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second prison term for Ahmet Turan Demir, head of the
People's Democracy Party. In February, he was sentenced to three
years and nine months in prison for going on a hunger strike in
1998 in support of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Demir is free pending the outcome of his appeals, which could
take a year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Demir drew a comparison between the
breakup of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia and
carving out a Kurdish state from Turkey during a speech in October
in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the Kurdish question) must be solved one way or the
other,'' the indictment quoted Demir as saying. ''Czechs and
Slovaks one day said, 'Let's ... establish separate states.' So
they solved their problems without fighting or trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment called Demir's statement separatist propaganda.
Another party member, Esin Akgul, who read a poem also deemed
separatist propaganda, also received one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's approximately 12 million Kurds are not recognized as a
minority. Turkey bans education and broadcasting in the Kurdish
language.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has waged a 15-year war against Kurdish guerrillas
fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey. More than 37,000
people have died in the conflict. --------

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 139; Nasdaq Up 150  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today as investors took
heart in the latest signs that rising interest rates are
successfully keeping inflation at bay. Buyers dipped into the
technology sector, snapping up shares of market leaders that have
been battered in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 139.47 at 10,661.80.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 26.22 at 1,446.82, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 150.02 at 3,550.93.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market higher today. Qualcomm rose
$4.125 to $70.50 and PMC-Sierra rose $10.50 to $163.75.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard soared $10.688 to $130.813 following upbeat
projections made at the company's semiannual meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $3.063 to $65.625. The company has asked for
extra time to formulate a breakup plan should a federal judge order
the company to divest its Windows operating systems business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Rick Sherlund said today the stock
may be able to recover some ''lost ground'' after the judge rules
and the lengthy appeal process gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 'quiet time' in which there is not much new news on the
lawsuit could enable sentiment to improve a bit,'' Sherlund told
clients. Sherlund, among Wall Street's most influential Microsoft
analysts, has triggered several shifts in the stock's performance
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer rose $1 to $45.563. A study published in the New England
Journal of Medicine reported that Pfizer's impotence treatment drug
Viagra caused no harmful changes in the blood flow of men with
severe heart disease. Pfizer financed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch added Pfizer to its ''Focus 1'' list of highly
recommended stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The market has gained strength in the past few sessions as a
string of economic reports have suggested that the runaway pace of
the nation's economic growth is slowing a bit. This morning, many
of the nation's retailers reported lackluster sales for May,
indicating that six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve
are beginning to quell consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the National Association of Purchasing Management issued
a report that growth in the industrial economy slowed during May.
The report also said inflationary pressures for industrial supplies
appear to have peaked in March.
</P>
<P>
   The report could convince the Fed to raise interest rates by a
slim quarter-percentage point -- or perhaps to hold them steady -- at
its next meeting on June 27-28, said Michael Moran, chief economist
at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say the most crucial report will be the Labor
Department's May employment report, due out before the start of
trading Friday. Any signs of slower growth -- whether in a higher
unemployment rate or lower wage pressures -- should enable the
market to extend its efforts to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has viewed the plummeting jobless rate as a sign that
companies would have to sharply raise wages and benefits to retain
workers. That could eventually force them to raise prices, setting
a stage for renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 424.73 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's midday pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.73 to
486.91.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market drew strength from overseas markets, which were
almost uniformly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Tito Puente, giant of Latin music, dies at 77  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bandleader and percussionist Tito Puente, who
rode to fame on the heels of the 1950s mambo craze and for the next
five decades helped define Latin jazz, has died. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Puente, who was recently treated for a heart problem, died
Wednesday at NYU Medical Center, his agent, Eddie Rodriguez, said
today. A hospital spokeswoman, Lourdes Torres, confirmed the death
but said no other information was being released at the family's
request.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tito was for me more than family,'' Cuban-born singer Celia
Cruz said from Buenos Aires. ''I met him in Havana in 1952 and
since then I had a brother, and when I arrived in New York (after
the Cuban revolution) he continued being my brother. Our world is
in mourning because one of the souls of Latin music has died.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente recorded more than 100 albums in his six decades in the
business. In February, he won his fifth Grammy for best traditional
tropical Latin performance for ''Mambo Birdland.'' He received a
National Medal of Arts from President Clinton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A trained pianist and percussionist, Puente's first musical job
was as a timbale player with the Machito Orchestra, a group that
had successfully merged the Big Band sound with a Latin beat.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Puente developed his flamboyant style and
convinced the band leader to move the timbales -- a pair of
single-headed drums mounted on stands and played with sticks -- from
the back of the band to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Puente's style was distinctive: wide-eyed, animated and
ever-moving, he managed to draw the crowd into the music, whether
they were fans or not.
</P>
<P>
   ''In front of a bandstand you've got to be a showman,'' Puente
once said. ''Once, I was strictly a musician with a long face and
back to the audience. Now I'm a showman, selling what I'm doing,
giving the people good vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son of Puerto Rican parents, Puente was born Ernest
Anthony Puente Jr. in New York City on April 20, 1923. (Some
references give other years.)
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ernest Sr., was a foreman in a razor-blade factory.
His mother called her son Ernestito, Little Ernest, then shortened
the name to Tito.
</P>
<P>
   It was his mother who noticed his musical talent and enrolled
him in a piano class at 7. Puente studied drums for years before
switching to timbales.
</P>
<P>
   After three years in the Navy during World War II, Puente
returned to Manhattan and studied conducting, orchestration and
theory at the famed Juilliard School of Music from 1945 to '47 on
the GI Bill.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a jazz arranger grew and for years he arranged
and played with other orchestras until he formed his own.
</P>
<P>
   When the mambo craze overtook the country in the 1950s, Puente's
fame soared and he became a regular headliner at the New York
Palladium. In the 1960s he headed to Hollywood where he
collaborated with the brightest Latino and jazz stars of the day.
</P>
<P>
   They included Celia Cruz, Charlie Palmieri, Ray Barretto,
Candido, Mongo Santamaria, Cal Tjader, Woody Herman, George
Shearing, Lionel Hampton and Machito.
</P>
<P>
   Another was Carlos Santana, whose early hits include Puente's
''Oye Como Va.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time he plays 'Oye Como Va,' I get a nice royalty
check,'' Puente said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Puente's Grammy-winning recordings were a three-album
tribute to Benny More featuring dozens of top Latin artists,
''Mambo Diablo'' and ''Goza Mi Timbal.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, RMM Records released a three-CD, 50-song compilation
from Puente's recorded output, titled ''50 Years of Swing.'' The
first cut, ''Que No, Que No,'' is from his ''El Rey del Mambo''
(''The King of the Mambo'') recording of 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ''The excitement of the rhythms and the beat make people
happy,'' he told The Associated Press in 1997. ''We try to get our
feelings to the people, so they enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most successful albums of the '50s was ''Puente Goes
Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some jazz bands, like (Stan) Kenton's, had added Latin
rhythms,'' Puente told an interviewer in 1957. ''It sounded good to
me. So I figured I might as well do the same thing, in reverse. I
start off writing a straight jazz arrangement, then I just add a
Latin rhythm section.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same reason kids like rock 'n' roll. It has the beat.
I think bop, which neglected rhythm and neglected dancers, did a
lot to kill big bands.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente had been released from a San Juan, Puerto Rico, hospital
May 2 after two days of treatment for an irregular heartbeat. He
canceled all his events in May, including three concerts planned
with the Symphonic Orchestra of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Margie, two sons and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> Four hospitals to repay $11.3 million in Medicare case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Four Connecticut hospitals will pay the
federal government $11.3 million in connection with overpayments
they received from an insurer linked to Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The payments meet the hospitals' financial responsibility in a
$74 million settlement the government reached in December 1999 with
Anthem Health Plans Inc., according to U.S. Attorney Stephen C.
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals were overpaid when Anthem's predecessor company,
Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Connecticut, falsified cost reports to
conceal its failure to meet government standards under the Medicare
program, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements announced Wednesday do not constitute evidence of
any wrongdoing by the hospitals, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said the payments would have no effect on
patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven
agreed to pay $8.3 million, including $2.3 million in interest. The
hospital has already repaid $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the investigation began when St. Raphael's
disclosed the fraud in 1998. The overpayments were discovered
during a corporate compliance program, according to Helayne
Lightstone, director of public relations for the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Other hospitals and their payments are: St. Vincent's Medical
Center in Bridgeport, $1.9 million; Bridgeport Hospital, $800,615;
and Griffin Hospital in Derby, $307,740.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will continue, focusing on other hospitals
that might be linked to the fraudulent activity, said John B.
Hughes, chief of the civil division for the U.S. attorney's office
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for the hospitals said hospital officials had been
unaware of the overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no malfeasance,'' said Bruce Hutchison, a spokesman
for St Vincent's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The repayments come as the Department of Justice and state
hospitals continue to unravel $32 million worth of Medicare
overpayments. The DOJ has now accounted for $11 million of the $32
million that was overpaid, Hughes said.

<HEADLINE> Final answer: former game show contestant admits embezzling money  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) --This time, Paul Barbour made it to the hot
seat, where he got to give his final answer.
</P>
<P>
   Only this wasn't ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' and it
wasn't Regis Philbin listening to him.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, a former ''Millionaire'' contestant who has written a
soon-to-be-released book on how to get on the game show, admitted
to U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue that he embezzled $213,800
from an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour gained instant celebrity status after he and his two
brothers became the first three siblings in the country to make it
onto ABC-TV's popular game show. Although none made it to the final
''hot seat'' round, the brothers were the focus of a flurry of
media attention, including appearances on ''The Rosie O'Donnell
Show'' and ''Inside Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, 38, of Baldwinsville, appeared in federal court
Wednesday with his accomplice, Kellie A. Moran, to plead guilty to
defrauding Nationwide Insurance Co. through the mail. Each faces
five years in prison, fines of up to $250,000 and an order to pay
more than $150,000 in restitution when they are sentenced Sept. 29
by Judge Norman A. Mordue.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour and Moran, 41, admitted inventing a scheme in 1998 to
defraud Nationwide, where Barbour worked as an in-house lawyer.
Between April and December 1998, Barbour authorized paying about
$213,800 of Nationwide's money to a phony medical services company
controlled by Moran, a registered nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to pay for evaluations of Nationwide clients'
medical records. Moran's company got paid for reviewing more than
140 case files. Nationwide only received one written report from
her.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the two spent $13,514 to pay off a
car loan and $3,254 as an investment with Dean Witter. The rest of
the money is unaccounted for, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew
Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour did not return phone calls Thursday seeking comment.
Previously, he had declared himself innocent and said he would take
his case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour appeared on ''Millionaire's'' second show in August 1999
-- a month after he was indicted by a federal grand jury. His
brother Mark got on the show in March and their older brother Mike
made it on in May.
</P>
<P>
   Having successfully advised his brothers on how to get on the
show, Paul decided to write a book with tips on how to qualify as a
contestant, ''Who Wants to be a Contestant.'' The 200-page book is
being published by TV Books and is scheduled to be distributed by
HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   TV Books publisher Peter Kaufman did not return phone calls
seeking comment about whether Barbour's felony conviction will have
any impact on publication and distribution of the book.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Receive Unity Prize  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AACHEN, Germany (AP) -- When President Clinton visits this
historic town this week to receive a prestigious European unity
prize, he will mingle with people who have lived life without
borders for years.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's westernmost city on the Dutch and Belgian borders has
been a symbol of European integration since the 8th century, when
the Holy Roman emperor Charlemagne ruled a large swath of western
Europe from his palace in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Germans, Dutch and Belgians in the region have built a
small model of a united Europe. With border checks gone, many live
in one country and work in another. Three currencies jingle in
their pockets since storekeepers cater to cross-border shoppers. An
ambitious three-nation fund promotes economic projects for an area
of 4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   During his one-day visit Friday, Clinton will be presented with
the International Charlemagne Prize, awarded for 50 years by Aachen
city leaders to world leaders who have promoted European unity as a
safeguard against future world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was chosen for his ''contributions to European
cooperation,'' including supporting former communist countries to
join the 15-nation European Union. The award also is a symbol of
thanks for American help in rebuilding postwar Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Aachen, a city of 250,000 otherwise known for its crunchy
gingerbread and hot springs, Clinton's visit has set off an
unprecedented bustle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is to give a speech on U.S.-European relations,
will receive the prize at an open-air event on a cobblestone
courtyard between the 14th-century town hall and a cathedral begun
by Charlemagne around 800. Aachen residents are expected to jam
into the tree-lined square to greet Clinton on what is likely to be
his last official visit to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He is the third American to win the prize after former
secretaries of state George Marshall and German-native Henry
Kissinger. Last year, it went to British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners include Sir Winston Churchill, King Juan Carlos of
Spain, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Czech President Vaclav
Havel.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 151; Dow Up 108  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied Thursday as investors took heart
in the latest signs that rising interest rates are successfully
keeping inflation at bay. Buyers dipped into the technology sector,
snapping up shares of market leaders that have been battered in the
past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index was up 151.46, or
by 4.5 percent in afternoon trading, at 3,552.37. The Nasdaq soared
a record 7.9 percent on Tuesday on bargain-hunting before giving up
some ground on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 107.94, or 1.3 percent,
at 10,630.27, and broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The gains came as trading volume rose from the moderate pace of
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to renewed interest in technology shares, the market
has gained strength as a string of economic reports suggests the
runaway pace of the nation's economic growth is slowing a bit. On
Thursday morning, many of the nation's retailers reported
lackluster sales for May, indicating that six interest-rate
increases by the Federal Reserve are beginning to quell consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the National Association of Purchasing Management issued
a report that growth in the industrial economy slowed during May.
The report also said inflationary pressures for industrial supplies
appear to have peaked in March.
</P>
<P>
   The report could persuade the Fed to raise interest rates by a
slim quarter-percentage point -- or perhaps to hold them steady -- at
its next meeting on June 27-28, said Michael Moran, chief economist
at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say the most crucial report will be the Labor
Department's May employment report, due out before the start of
trading Friday. Any signs of slower growth -- whether in a higher
unemployment rate or lower wage pressures -- should enable the
market to extend its efforts to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has viewed the plummeting jobless rate as a sign that
companies would have to sharply raise wages and benefits to retain
workers. That could eventually force them to raise prices, setting
a stage for renewed inflation.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Wins Pledge of China Aid  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- On a secretive, first foray abroad in 17 years,
North Korean leader Kim Jong Il won fresh pledges of Chinese aid,
consulted China's leaders about his summit with South Korea and
saluted their capitalist reforms, the governments announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A legendary recluse, Kim was feted by Chinese leaders, toured a
respected computer maker synonymous with China's economic rise and,
donning sunglasses, stood atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace
overlooking Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of Kim's Monday-to-Wednesday visit, hotly rumored
in Beijing and South Korea for two days, waited until the North
Korean leader, riding a special train, was safely home.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy aside, the visit's timing and treatment underscored its
significance for long isolated, communist North Korea and the
region. In two weeks, Kim meets South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
for the rival Koreas' first summit. North Korea has recently set up
diplomatic ties with Australia and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could be seen as further evidence that Kim's trying to
make some real significant reorientation in North Korean foreign
policy,'' said Marcus Noland of the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The summit was the first for China and North Korea since Kim's
father, Kim Il Sung, visited Beijing nine years ago. Ever since,
ties between the once-close communist allies have frayed as China
pursued free markets and South Korean investment while North Korea
sunk into economic torpor.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the visit's importance for China, Kim met Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and the six other members of the ruling
Communist Party's inner circle. Chinese state television showed
Jiang and Kim embracing.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling detail about the different paths their nations have
taken, Jiang wore a well-cut blue Western suit and tie. Kim had on
a high-collared gray Mao jacket, a badge with his father's bust on
his lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Kim made his last visit abroad in 1983, to China, and seldom
sees foreigners. Pressed for details about the North Korean leader
by foreign reporters, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang
Qiyue would only say that he ''looks to be in good health.''
</P>
<P>
   Both governments described the talks as friendly and important.
North Korea's news agency said China and North Korea cemented the
friendship ''sealed in blood,'' a reference to their common fight
in the 1950-53 Korean War. But few details were offered.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Kim that China ''welcomes and
supports the North Korean and South Korean summit and hopes to see
positive progress,'' Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing wants to see tensions between the Koreas eased, partly
so it can concentrate on economic development, but also to prevent
the United States from deploying a regional anti-missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   For North Korea, the June 12-14 summit in the North Korean
capital of Pyongyang could deliver South Korean aid and a chance to
show a more confident leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's ''position is strengthening, and the material gains that
he could expect to pick up in China and then in South Korea he
could further use to consolidate his power at home,'' said Noland,
the North Korea watcher.
</P>
<P>
   During the months that Beijing and Pyongyang negotiated Kim's
visit, North Korea was rumored to be seeking $800 million worth of
Chinese food, fuel and forgiveness of North Korean debts, Noland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim took home a Chinese promise for free food and other material
assistance, spokeswoman Zhang said. She refused to specify the
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Gripped by five years of food shortages and economic collapse,
North Korea has made tentative, piecemeal efforts to change its
collectivized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   In meeting Jiang, Kim noted the ''great achievements'' China has
made and said North Korea ''supports the reform policy pursued by
the Chinese side,'' Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently defending his own policies, Kim added that North
Korea ''is building a Korean-style socialism according to its
specific national conditions,'' China's Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the visit's more unexpected moments, Kim toured the
Legend Group, a Chinese computer maker in Beijing's high-tech
district of computer and Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The stop showed that Kim ''is very interested in computer
technology,'' not that North Korea would follow Chinese reforms,
said Shinya Kato, a Japanese expert on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Kim's trip heralded a return to the heyday of
close ties, Zhang said: ''A philosopher once said, 'No man can step
into the same river twice' -- which means that things are always
changing.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Clears Beer Vending Machines  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- It was a busy day Thursday at liquor stores across
Japan, where workers were dismantling a national institution bottle
by bottle: the beer vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of rampant alcoholism and underage drinking have forced
the country's liquor stores to adopt a voluntary ban on using the
machines. Shops complying with the plan pulled the plug late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move dealt a near death blow to alcohol vending machines,
which for decades have symbolized the Japanese penchant for
automated convenience -- and a taste for booze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I'm taking all the beer out -- and putting in the
juice,'' said Masayuki Murata as he stood beside an emptied machine
in front of his family's Surugaya Liquor Store in central Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The 130,000-member All Japan Liquor Merchants Association
estimated that up to 70 percent of the nation's 170,000 alcohol
vending machines were shut down by the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Allowances were made for stores that depend heavily on the
machines, which typically operate until 11 p.m. -- providing a quick
and easy drink for people who get off work after liquor stores
close.
</P>
<P>
   But the ban sent a clear message: beer from a machine is
becoming a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the vending machine itself is still going strong,
glowing on nighttime streets like beacons of commercialism and
convenience, selling everything from soda and juice to CDs and
videos.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on beer vending machines was aimed at cutting down on
underage drinking. Government statistics are spotty, but a
government survey in 1996 found more than half of male high school
seniors drank alcohol at least once or twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   Such students are typically 17 or 18 -- well below the drinking
age of 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a problem that children can buy something at a vending
machine that they can't buy face-to-face in a store,'' said Iwane
Matsui, chairman of the National Congress of PTA Associations of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking in general is a growing concern in Japan. Alcohol
consumption is surging especially among women, and inebriated
office workers are a common sight on nighttime streets and in
subways.
</P>
<P>
   The vending machine ban, however, was not expected to make much
of a dent on underage drinking. Convenience stores have been moving
into the beer-selling business in recent years and have been
criticized for selling alcohol without checking customers' IDs.
</P>
<P>
   The liquor store association is now pushing to get a law
proposed in Parliament that would crack down on stores that sell to
underage drinkers and tighten restrictions on liquor licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to take a good look at how we sell liquor in Japan,''
said Mamoru Tanaka, spokesman for the association.
</P>
<P>
   The vending machine ban could hit some liquor stores where it
hurts: the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Hachigo Murata, the owner of the tiny Surugaya Liquor Store,
said he was making about 10 percent of his sales on the cluster of
machines next to his shop. To make up for the shortfall, he plans
to stay open an hour later each night, until about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how customers are going to react,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those worries, the role of the beer vending machine has
declined in recent years, as convenience stores and large discount
shops that sell in bulk have moved in on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Japanese, beer fan Yasuo Kawabata said he just drives
to a local discount outlet, buys a case of brew and takes it home.
When he gets off work at night, a cold bottle is waiting for him in
the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are plenty of cheaper places where you can buy a lot,''
he said on Thursday on a Tokyo street. ''I almost never use a
vending machine, so the ban doesn't bother me at all.''

<HEADLINE> INS To Put Ore. Detainees in Hotel  </HEADLINE>
By AVIVA BRANDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Foreign travelers denied entry into the
country because they don't have the right documents will stay
overnight in guarded hotel rooms instead of jail, immigration
officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service was responding to
policies that have earned this city the name ''Deportland'' in some
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Records show immigration inspectors at Portland International
Airport turn away foreigners nine times as often as inspectors in
Seattle, though some of the visitors later gain entry through San
Francisco or Seattle with the same documents.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese travel agencies have blacklisted the airport.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, rejected travelers are sent home immediately,
though those who miss a return flight are detained overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel policy will apply to people who have not attempted to
enter the country through fraud or misrepresentation. It will cost
about $300 a day per detainee, about four times as much as keeping
the person in jail, said Phillip Crawford, INS deputy director in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last resort in that we still intend ... to return
these people to their home countries on the same day, either on a
return flight or through another port of departure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign business travelers say they have avoided Portland
because of jailings, forced return flights and rudeness by INS
inspectors. The INS held a meeting April 27 with the Japanese
Consul General, officials from the State Department, the business
community and the Port of Portland, which manages the airport, to
discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the new policy was positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just very pleased that Korean nationals will not be
housed as common criminals in county jails,'' Robert Donaldson,
South Korea's honorary consul general in Portland, told The
(Portland) Oregonian.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to be treated as human beings, and that's what
we expect,'' Donaldson said.

time to formulate a breakup plan should a federal judge order the
company to divest its Windows operating systems business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Rick Sherlund said today the stock
may be able to recover some ''lost ground'' after the judge rules
and the lengthy appeal process gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 'quiet time' in which there is not much new news on the
lawsuit could enable sentiment to improve a bit,'' Sherlund told
clients. Sherlund, among Wall Street's most influential Microsoft
analysts, has triggered several shifts in the stock's performance
in recent weeks.

<P>
   Pfizer rose 81.3 cents to $45.25. A study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine reported that Pfizer's impotence
treatment drug Viagra caused no harmful changes in the blood flow
of men with severe heart disease. Pfizer financed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch added Pfizer to its ''Focus 1'' list of highly
recommended stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The market has gained strength in the past few sessions as a
string of economic reports have suggested that the runaway pace of
the nation's economic growth is slowing a bit. This morning, many
of the nation's retailers reported lackluster sales for May,
indicating that six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve
are beginning to quell consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the National Association of Purchasing Management issued
a report that growth in the industrial economy slowed during May.
The report also said inflationary pressures for industrial supplies
appear to have peaked in March.
</P>
<P>
   The report could convince the Fed to raise interest rates by a
slim quarter-percentage point -- or perhaps to hold them steady -- at
its next meeting on June 27-28, said Michael Moran, chief economist
at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say the most crucial report will be the Labor
Department's May employment report, due out before the start of
trading Friday. Any signs of slower growth -- whether in a higher
unemployment rate or lower wage pressures -- should enable the
market to extend its efforts to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has viewed the plummeting jobless rate as a sign that
companies would have to sharply raise wages and benefits to retain
workers. That could eventually force them to raise prices, setting
a stage for renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 621.22 million
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday afternoon's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.19 to
487.37.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market drew strength from overseas markets, which were
almost uniformly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Ethnic Indians Live in Fear  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Ashok Chand and his wife, Mahoni Lata, have
had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Fiji's government crisis began, the ethnic
Indian couple are fleeing their home near the national parliament,
where rebels hold more than 30 people hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fear for our lives,'' Chand said, clutching a cardboard box
of belongings as he packed to go stay with relatives. ''Yesterday I
was robbed. Today I just want to get out.'' Lata stood nearby,
holding the couple's pet cat.
</P>
<P>
   Chand and Lata, like other ethnic Indians, are living in terror
in this country 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia, where
ethnic unrest exploded two weeks ago and shows few signs of
abating.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is rooted in simmering tensions between the country's
large ethnic Indian minority and the Fijian majority, many of whom
are angry that the Indians have gained power.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels led by businessman George Speight are Fijian, while
Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and other hostages -- many of them
legislators -- are ethnic Indian. The rebels want Chaudhry, Fiji's
first prime minister from the minority, removed from power and
Fijians of Indian ancestry barred from leading the country again.
</P>
<P>
   Chand and Lata live less than a mile from the parliamentary
compound where Speight and hundreds of supporters have holed up
with their captives. Hooded, armed thugs have roamed the streets
around the compound, stoning cars and buses. They have roughed up
and robbed taxi drivers and stolen their vehicles. Most victims
were ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, the day the hostages were seized, a rampaging mob
tore through Suva, the capital, and looted businesses. Gangs have
attacked Indian homes and businesses in Suva and outlying villages
in the days since. Until martial law was imposed, police acted
slowly or not at all to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen men were arrested last week after rampaging through an
Indian farming settlement on Suva's outskirts, beating and robbing
people in their houses and stealing cattle and chickens, police
said. In the Indian-dominated village of Viria, bandits ransacked
and set fire to homes during several nights last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came onto our property in masks and started throwing
stones and smashed the windows before they entered,'' Jagat Prasad
told The Fiji Times newspaper. ''They took a stereo, video deck and
money from the house before setting the rooms on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the worst moment of our lives,'' said another
resident, 79-year-old Bhagirati, who uses only one name. ''I am
very frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's military took control Monday, declaring martial law
and opening negotiations with Speight's supporters. The military
rulers have accepted Speight's major demands: scrapping the 1997
constitution blamed by indigenous Fijians for giving too much power
to ethnic Indians, deposing President Ratu Sir Kamisise Mara and
offering Speight and his gang amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Suva, shops remain closed Thursday. Business leaders
say many will stay shut until the crisis is resolved, and some will
probably never recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 80 percent of business will not get back to normal
because many businessmen don't have the funds to start up again,''
said Himmat Lodhia, a spokesman for downtown retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Fijians of Indian ancestry make up 44 percent of Fiji's
population of 813,000, but they control much of the commerce.
Damage to Indian businesses means damage to Fiji's economy, which
is centered around sugar, timber production and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's four sugar mills have been idled since the crisis
started, just as the harvest was due to begin. Shipments to
Malaysia, Korea and Portugal have been rescheduled, with no
prospect that the orders will be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ''No farmer feels like harvesting while his leader is held
hostage by a gunman,'' National Farmers Union spokesman Marika
Silimaibau said of Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   Indians may be scared, but they are also furious. One
businessman who asked that his name not be published said the
Indian community is used to being discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of anger, but I don't think they (Indians) will
do anything about it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rival Flags Waved on Jerusalem Day  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jerusalem Day, Israel's annual commemoration of
its unification of the city, was marked Thursday with raised fists
and defiant waving of Israeli and Palestinian flags.
</P>
<P>
   As peace negotiators from both sides worked to resolve the
future status of the disputed city, the two peoples who share it
fought it out with words: ''Jerusalem is ours!'' shouted
ultra-nationalist Jews. ''No, it's ours!'' Palestinians shouted
back.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians seek traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as a
future capital. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has maintained
that Jerusalem will remain united under the sovereignty of the
Jewish state, as it has since the 1967 Middle East war when Israel
captured the eastern sector of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians became heated
Thursday when militant right-wing Jews from the outlawed Kach
movement protested in front of the Orient House, Palestinian
headquarters in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Itamar Ben-Gvir, a Kach activist, yelled, ''Arabs get out -- it's
not your country.'' A shouting match and then scuffles broke out
between seven ultra-nationalist Jews and about 30 Palestinians
until they were separated by police. Ben-Gvir was taken into
custody, to the cheers of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, about 40 militant Jews from the Temple Mount
Faithful group marched passed the Orient House, blowing ram's horns
and waving Israeli flags. As they went by, a Palestinian stood on a
nearby stone wall waving a large Palestinian flag while others
behind him chanted ''God is Great.''
</P>
<P>
   The status of Jerusalem is the most emotional issue to be
resolved in a final Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Some Barak associates have said the dispute over Jerusalem is so
complex that it might have to be left unresolved for many more
years, even if agreement is reached on all other issues, such as
Palestinian refugees and final borders.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city is no longer physically separated, a wide
ethnic and economic divide remains between its Jewish and Arab
populations, which rarely mix outside of the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Also ringing in Jerusalem Day were hundreds of teen-agers from
Israeli nationalist youth movements, who clogged the alleys of the
Old City, dancing and chanting nationalist slogans while
Palestinian residents watched.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think that if they come in and shout it will scare the
Arabs but you see, the Palestinian flag keeps waving,'' said Hassam
Rajbi, a 27-year-old Palestinian security guard. ''Jerusalem Day is
a sad day for us because they think they can keep the city
united.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ariel Sharon, head of the opposition Likud Party, called it
a day of celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for the
last 3,000 years,'' said Sharon, after visiting the Western Wall,
Judaism's most revered site, which is in the part of the city
captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel more and more confident that no one can take this
Promised Land from us.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Supreme Court allows Continental pilot to sue over online postings </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Continental Airlines pilot who a federal
jury found was sexually harassed by pornography strewn about
cockpits can sue the airline on charges it failed to stop fellow
pilots from posting defamatory statements on a company computer
bulletin board, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-0 decision reinstates a lawsuit by Capt. Tammy S. Blakey,
and declares that harassment outside of the workplace is fair game
for litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling allows Blakey's lawyer to take depositions, and then
requires a state trial judge in Essex County to determine whether
the remarks on the Crew Members Forum were severe enough to be
considered harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Before a trial can take place, the judge must also determine if
Continental was alerted to the questionable postings and if the
forum provided a benefit to Continental, the state's highest court
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said that Continental could avoid trial if it
demonstrated prompt efforts to correct any harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Continental issued a response that asserted ''it should not be
liable for the personal, private opinions of (Blakey's) co-workers,
completely unrelated to their employee duties made outside of her
workplace in a forum which Continental does not control.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said it believes the lawsuit will again be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey lawyer Linda B. Kenney said Continental lawyers responded
to letters complaining about the remarks on the forum by asserting
the company had no duty or authority to act because the bulletin
board was not part of the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks appeared after Blakey filed her federal lawsuit
against Continental in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain pilots implied that she should commit suicide, that
she was money hungry, that she was a terrible pilot, that she
destroyed planes ... and none of that was true,'' Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey, who was based at Continental's hub in Newark at the
time, was not allowed to add the forum matter to the federal
lawsuit, so she filed a lawsuit in state Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey, 40, of Arlington, Wash., is seeking unspecified monetary
damages.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury here in October 1997 awarded her $875,000, of
which a half-million dollars was for emotional distress from a
hostile workplace. The remainder was for back pay.
</P>
<P>
   After considering an appeal by Houston-based Continental, U.S.
District Judge William G. Bassler reduced the distress award to
$250,000. He ruled the evidence did not support a $500,000 award,
which the judge said was perhaps the highest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Continental has appealed, so no money has yet been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey took leave soon after filing her lawsuit and returned to
Continental after the verdict. She is now based in Seattle, where
she flies a wide-body jet, the Boeing 777, Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Her case exposed the tradition among airline pilots, nearly all
of whom are men -- of leaving lewd pictures in the cockpit, in
flight manuals, behind equipment panels and pasted in drawers.
</P>
<P>
   During the federal trial, Blakey testified she made repeated
complaints to her supervisors about ''rampant'' pornographic
pictures in cockpits, including several on which male pilots
scrawled her name, and one of a naked woman penetrated sexually
with a bloody saber.
</P>
<P>
   Continental maintained that Blakey's complaints only began when
her schedule changed in December 1991 due to seniority, and after
the company raised concerns about how many days she had missed.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey testified she was hired in 1984 and in January 1990 she
became the first woman at Continental Airlines -- and possibly the
nation -- to attain the rank of captain of an Airbus A300, a
wide-body jet.

<HEADLINE> Toxicity document revealed on fire-safe cigarettes  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Antismoking groups continued lobbying for
so-called fire-safe cigarette legislation by presenting new
evidence Thursday about the product's relative toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, meantime, put forth a new bill that would extend by
about a year over a previously vetoed bill -- to mid-2003 -- the time
manufacturers have to get the new cigarettes on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for a Tobacco Free New York on Thursday announced it
had a document ascribed to Philip Morris which concluded that
fire-safe cigarettes the tobacco company was working on would be no
more toxic than traditional cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would seem to indicate with these tests Philip Morris has
solved the problem which the governor raised in his veto message,''
said Russell Sciandra, of the Center for a Tobacco Free New York.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of increased toxicity was an objection Gov.
George Pataki raised last week in vetoing a fire-safe cigarette
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Results of smoke chemistry analysis, cytotoxity testing,
genotoxicity testing, and inhalation revealed only minor,
inconsistent changes,'' the document said. Philip Morris officials
later confirmed they presented the report at a scientific
conference in March.
</P>
<P>
   The antismoking groups acknowledged that the document was only
further evidence of what company officials already said -- that
initial tests that showed cigarettes with a different paper did not
present added health risks. It was used mainly to counter Pataki's
argument and to show Philip Morris would have no trouble meeting
any deadline the state sets for fire-safe cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''These test results ... give us great hope that such technology
can greatly reduce the incidence of cigarette-caused fires without
increasing the risk of cancer, lung and heart disease in smokers,''
said a letter signed by the American Cancer Society, the American
Lung Association, the League of Women Voters, New York Public
Interest Research Group and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A new bill from Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, a Manhattan
Democrat, also addresses toxicity. It would require tobacco makers
to certify that the changed cigarettes would be no more toxic than
those now available.
</P>
<P>
   The previous bill would have required fire-safe cigarettes to be
sold in New York in April 2002. The new bill pushes that back to
mid-2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's suggestions are ones we agree with,'' said Sen.
Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, who said he will introduce the
same bill as Grannis. ''We will include them in the new bill and
pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also cited potential illegal sales of traditional
cigarettes as a reason for his veto. Grannis' office and Padavan
said separate bills in both houses of the Legislature would deal
with bootlegging concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is ''definitely interested'' in the new legislation, said
his spokeswoman Suzanne Morris. He is ''committed to having a bill
and passing it this session and he's hopeful that's going to
happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris officials reiterated their opinion that national,
and not state, legislators should address the topic.

<HEADLINE> 'Harry Potter' Posts Casting Call  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Warner Bros. is looking for Muggles to play Harry
Potter, the young English wizard, and his pals, ginger-haired Ron
and toothy, talented Hermione, in the first Potter film.
</P>
<P>
   Brits only -- ages 9 to 11 -- need apply.
</P>
<P>
   The casting call, on the movie's official Web site, invites
youngsters who ''look like Harry Potter, Ron Weasley or Hermione
Granger'' to send photographs and videotapes of themselves telling
a joke and reading a paragraph from one of the best-selling books
by British author J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   Filming of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' the first
Potter adventure, starts in Britain this summer, for release next
year. It will be directed by Chris Columbus (''Mrs. Doubtfire'' and
the first two ''Home Alone'' movies), with Steve Kloves (''The
Fabulous Baker Boys'') writing the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. Pictures already has tried conventional casting
methods but decided to look further afield.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Krizman, acting director of communications at the Screen
Actors Guild in Los Angeles, said the move does not mark the first
time a studio used the Internet to solicit actors. ''This is just
the electronic version of your typical casting call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Potter books follow the exploits of an 11-year-old boy who
discovers he inherited magical powers from his parents, a pair of
wizards killed by a powerful enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In ''The Sorcerer's Stone,'' Harry leaves the world of the
Muggles -- ordinary, non-magic people -- and an aunt and uncle who
treat him like dirt, to study at Hogwarts, an English boarding
school for wizards. There he makes friends with Ron and Hermione.
</P>
<P>
   Harry is a daring scrap of a boy with dark hair and glasses --
and a distinctive, lightning-shaped scar on his forehead -- while
Ron is ''tall and thin and gangling'' with freckles, large hands
and feet, and a long nose. And the clever, spell-working Hermione?
Picture bushy brown hair, large front teeth and a bossy voice.
</P>
<P>
   At Hamley's, a huge toy store in central London, news of the
movie was received with enthusiasm. But many British kids proved
more diffident about putting themselves forward for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not very good at acting,'' said Jonathan Britten, a
tousle-headed 9-year-old. ''I just like the adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old aspiring actor Alexander Darley, however, was
already a step ahead of many young Potter hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've just auditioned,'' he said. ''I sent a photo and have
already filmed a tape.''
</P>
<P>
   He's done his research, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going for the part of Ron Weasley, because I'm quite tall
and I've got freckles and ginger hair,'' he said. ''I think the
books are quite enchanting. They really get you involved in the
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Rowling's first three books have passed the 30 million
mark worldwide, having been translated in 35 languages in more than
200 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth Potter volume will be published simultaneously in
Britain and the United States on July 8.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Seizes Transportation Co.  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two weeks after seizing a
nongovernment TV station, Slobodan Milosevic's administration
lashed out again Thursday by taking over an opposition-run public
transport company in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to take the Belgrade City Transport company from
the hands of the opposition-run municipal authorities followed a
four-day strike by private carriers which brought public transport
in the capital to a virtual halt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The incapable and irresponsible municipal government in
Belgrade has blocked all vital public services in the capital and
created a complete chaos,'' a government statement on the takeover
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The total collapse of public transport in Belgrade has
jeopardized living and working conditions of all the citizens, as
well as functioning of enterprises, schools, hospitals,'' said the
statement carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover was part of a campaign by President Milosevic's
government to discredit the opposition ahead of municipal elections
due by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the government seized Belgrade's main Studio B
television and B2-92 radio. The move triggered few days of protests
but also revived traditional differences between Serbia's
opposition leaders who could not agree on what to do in response.
</P>
<P>
   The mild response to the media takeover obviously encouraged
Milosevic to move against the transport firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of further rift among Milosevic's opponents, key
opposition leader Zoran Djindjic admitted Thursday that
''opposition unity so far has been mostly rhetorical, and even that
has been jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's opposition leaders -- formally united in their struggle
to oust Milosevic -- have been unable to mount a credible challenge
to the autocratic president, who has moved to silence critics and
independent media.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regime is continuing with violence which is destroying the
legal order,'' warned Belgrade's deputy mayor Milan Bozic. ''We
fear this government act could have much more serious consequences
then it seems at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the takeover of public transport company, Milosevic's
spokesman Nikola Sainovic said ''the work (of the transport
company) involved a lot of criminal deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition took control over Belgrade and dozens of other
Serbian cities at municipal elections in 1996. When Milosevic's
allies tried to annul the opposition victories, they triggered more
than three months of street protests.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, Milosevic's government has sought to
undermine the opposition rule in Belgrade and other cities. The
capital's private carriers went on strike last Monday after the
government refused to allow a rise in prices of the transport
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   For four days Belgrade residents hitchhiked or competed for
available taxis to get to work or return home. Shortly after the
government session on Thursday, the private carriers were back in
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, an inspection team was dispatched to the offices
of the Belgrade's own transport company which has been brought to
the verge of bankruptcy after years of Serbia's economic decline
and the lack of funds to maintain vehicles or import spare parts
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia's other republic of Montenegro, a senior official
accused Milosevic's federal government of complicity in the slaying
of the national security adviser in the republic's pro-independence
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Rifat Rastoder, a deputy speaker of Montenegro's parliament,
said the killing Wednesday of Goran Zugic was an attempt to create
conditions in Montenegro that would allow Belgrade to impose a
state of emergency.

<HEADLINE> Tycoon Denounces Putin Control Plan  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Almost alone in public opposition to President
Vladimir Putin, Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky on Thursday
denounced a Kremlin plan to tighten control over the nation's
regions as a move away from democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Putin is trying to do will lead to dictatorship,''
Berezovsky told a news conference. ''It's a revival of the
Soviet-style system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was elected president in March, has made
strengthening federal control over Russia's independent-minded
provinces a top priority. He says the plan is necessary to fix the
ailing economy and keep Russia from breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, gave preliminary
approval Wednesday to three bills Putin proposed to rein in
regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky was the only legislator to speak out strongly against
the plan, and on the eve of the vote he published an open letter
outlining his objections. The letter was widely discussed in the
Russian media.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, who had close ties with former President Boris
Yeltsin's inner circle, said Thursday he had ''normal'' relations
with the new president and denied that his protest stemmed from a
personal rift with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, whose business interests range from oil to car sales
to media, was a controversial figure during the Yeltsin years.
Critics claim he wielded excessive influence from behind the
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal of his one-man campaign against Putin's plan
was to encourage criticism from the public and the governors. Most
governors have welcomed the plan even though it erodes their power
and only a few have dared to criticize it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are afraid to do that, and it's very bad,'' Berezovsky
said. ''I want to show them that it's necessary -- and not at all
dangerous -- to put forward their arguments against it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Putin's plan was a mistake caused by lack of experience,
not a display of an authoritarian streak.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's proposal calls for changing the composition of the upper
house of parliament, the Federation Council. The chamber is made up
of regional governors and heads of regional legislatures, but the
new plan calls for full-time, appointed legislators, which would
reduce the governors' say in federal politics.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains provisions for the president to dismiss elected
governors and dissolve local legislatures whose policies are
determined by courts to violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says one-fifth of local laws contradict the Russian
Constitution, and many rich provinces have balked at sharing
revenues with the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky claimed many Duma members were reluctant to publicly
criticize the plan for fear of alienating the Kremlin and expressed
hope that opposition would soon become strong enough to
significantly amend it.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied today as investors took heart in
the latest signs that rising interest rates are successfully
keeping inflation at bay. Buyers dipped into the technology sector,
snapping up shares of market leaders that have been battered in the
past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 62.71 at 10,585.04.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 15.30 at 1,435.90, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 123.02 at 3,523.93.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market higher today. Qualcomm rose
$3.063 to $69.438 and PMC-Sierra rose $12.875 to $166.125.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard soared $9.688 to $129.813 following upbeat
projections made at the company's semiannual meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $1.563 to $64.125. The company has asked for
extra time to formulate a breakup plan should a federal judge order
the company to divest its Windows operating systems business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Rick Sherlund said today the stock
may be able to recover some ''lost ground'' after the judge rules
and the lengthy appeal process gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 'quiet time' in which there is not much new news on the
lawsuit could enable sentiment to improve a bit,'' Sherlund told
clients. Sherlund, among Wall Street's most influential Microsoft
analysts, has triggered several shifts in the stock's performance
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer rose 37.5 cents to $44.938. A study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine reported that Pfizer's impotence
treatment drug Viagra caused no harmful changes in the blood flow
of men with severe heart disease. Pfizer financed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch added Pfizer to its ''Focus 1'' list of highly
recommended stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The market has gained strength in the past few sessions as a
string of economic reports have suggested that the runaway pace of
the nation's economic growth is slowing a bit. This morning, many
of the nation's retailers reported lackluster sales for May,
indicating that six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve
are beginning to quell consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the National Association of Purchasing Management issued
a report that growth in the industrial economy slowed during May.
The report also said inflationary pressures for industrial supplies
appear to have peaked in March.
</P>
<P>
   The report could persuade the Fed to raise interest rates by a
slim quarter-percentage point -- or perhaps to hold them steady -- at
its next meeting on June 27-28, said Michael Moran, chief economist
at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an end to the Fed's long run of rate increases
helped financial stocks today. Merrill Lynch rose 5 15/16 to 104
13/16 and PNC Financial rose 3 1/16 to 53\.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say the most crucial report will be the Labor
Department's May employment report, due out before the start of
trading Friday. Any signs of slower growth -- whether in a higher
unemployment rate or lower wage pressures -- should enable the
market to extend its efforts to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has viewed the plummeting jobless rate as a sign that
companies would have to sharply raise wages and benefits to retain
workers. That could eventually force them to raise prices, setting
a stage for renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 734.80 million
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday afternoon's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.93 to
487.11.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market drew strength from overseas markets, which were
almost uniformly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Tower of Pisa To Reopen in 2001  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISA, Italy (AP) -- The leaning Tower of Pisa will reopen in June
2001 after a decade of work to stop its perilous tilt, the
government announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Public Works said about 200 students will be
allowed to tour the tower later this month for a preview.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists were last allowed into the 12th-century tower a decade
ago. It was closed for work aimed to stabilize its tilt, then at 6
degrees, or 13 feet off the perpendicular.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of soil have been removed from under the foundation and
lead counterweights were placed at the monument's base. The work is
now in its final phase.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Claims Rebel Reversals  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Using newly acquired weapons including
Israeli warplanes, Sri Lanka's military halted the Tamil rebels one
mile from Jaffna, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It said the government forces were gaining the upper hand and
had killed three guerrillas in a clash near Sarasalai, a village in
the northern Jaffna Peninsula, where fighting was raging.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's reversals began April 22 when nearly 10,000 troops
gave up the Elephant Pass linking the mainland with the northern
Jaffna Peninsula, which the rebels seek as part of a Tamil
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle at the pass opened the way for the Tamil separatists
to reach the outskirts of Jaffna in the battle to recapture their
former stronghold of 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the Elephant Pass setback we did not posses the high
degree of fire power that the (Tamil) Tigers had acquired,''
Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said on state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers rallied when Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga ''contacted several leaders of friendly and sympathetic
countries in getting down the latest and best weapons,'' Ratwatte
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate on the new acquisitions. But army officers
say the troops defending Jaffna now have multiple barrel rocket
launchers which helped halt the rebel advance on the city.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of Tamil Tiger rebels came as close as one mile
from the city center, but they were driven back, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The military also said the air force has doubled bombing raids
after acquiring new aircraft from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The government had imposed censorship on war reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Ratwatte, the defense minister, said he literally emerged into a
battle when he visited Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I arrived in Jaffna on May 18 unannounced, I had to jump
out of the helicopter in the dead of night because the Tigers were
shelling the Palali air base with their long range guns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that the rebels had also shelled
Kankesanturai port. The port and air base are the only supply lines
for 40,000 troops battling to prevent a rebel takeover of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Palali air base would leave government soldiers
trapped in the peninsula with no land route available to leave.
Escape by sea would be unsafe with the rebels attacking the navy
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's Tamil minority says it faces discrimination from the
Sinhalese majority, which controls the government and the military.
The government denies any bias.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are trying to establish an independent homeland in
the north and east for the country's 3.2 million Tamils. The
17-year civil war has killed more than 62,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Mount Etna Spits Lava and Ash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) -- Mount Etna's southern crater erupted
Thursday morning after five hours of tremors, spitting out a
fountain of fiery lava and sending up a mile-high column of ash and
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular display could be seen from nearby coastal towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no danger caused by the explosion, only the fallout
of ash on the villages lying southeast of Etna,'' said Salvatore
Inguaggiato of the Sistema Poseidon, a volcano monitoring
organization in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   The column of ash billowed more than a mile above the ground and
the stream of lava stretched for 600 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Etna's last major eruption was in 1992, but minor eruptions
occur every few months.

<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. jets bombed military sites in
northern Iraq on Thursday for a fourth consecutive day, returning
fire by Iraqi gunners, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone were fired upon by
anti-aircraft artillery from two sites near the towns of Bashiqah
and Tall'Afar, 250 miles north of Baghdad, the U.S. European
Command said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft safely returned to Incirlik air base in southern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified
military spokesman as saying the planes bombed ''civil and service
installations.'' It said the planes dropped flares on crops in what
it called an attempt to ''cause damage to our national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not cite any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been enforcing northern and southern
no-fly zones in Iraq since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq considers the zones violations of its territorial
sovereignty and has been challenging the patrols since December
1998.

<HEADLINE> For first time, St. Joseph's Hawk a woman  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos PADL103-104
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Sarah Brennan believes she's more than
prepared for the new role she's assuming at St. Joseph's
University. In fact, you could say her confidence is unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Brennan, a three-season manager for the men's
basketball team, this week became the first woman to be named the
school's mascot. She's the 25th person named to suit up in the
university's well-known Hawk costume.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the fact that I am a woman is a pretty big
signature,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brennan said she's also hoping people don't just concentrate
on her gender.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope when people see me at games, people don't know whether
I'm a guy or a girl,'' said Brennan, a marketing major from Point
Pleasant, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they will, I know. It's something I wanted to do when I
came here, and I know all that's involved and all the
responsibilities of carrying on this great tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan's predecessors were known for some high-profile
incidents, including when the Hawk was attacked by the Rhode Island
mascot and a fan in 1998 and for a 1988 fight at the Palestra with
the La Salle Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ''She understands people will come after her, throw stuff,''
ex-mascot Chuck Sack said. ''She has the ability to focus on the
task at hand, and we're confident that won't be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Team officials say she will fill the Hawk's shoes admirably.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hawk is a symbol, and we couldn't have a better symbol
than Sarah,'' said Phil Martelli, the Hawks' head coach. ''We have
a lot of great people on this campus, but she's a special cut, she
really is. As the head of the program, I'm honored to have Sarah as
our symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gallagher, son of the late John T. Gallagher, who endowed
the full scholarship awarded to each Hawk annually, helped select
Brennan and said his father would have approved. Women have applied
in the past, but Brennan was the best choice this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew someday we'd have a girl,'' he said. ''I mean, the
school is 54 percent women now. The person inside the costume
doesn't change the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Don DiJulia, St. Joseph's athletic director, said Brennan fit
the part perfectly -- in every way. As is tradition, the Hawk
constantly flaps its wings during every game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Size, conditioning, flaps, the whole thing, it works,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-British Spy Seeks Book Review  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former British spy David Shayler was complying
with the law when he handed his new book over to government censors
Thursday, but did he really need the cancan dancer or the six guys
in dark suits and sunglasses playing soccer?
</P>
<P>
   While the entourage performed on the steps of the Home Office,
Shayler's agent, Chris Joseph, delivered two copies of the former
MI5 man's novel to make sure no state secrets were compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The government obtained an injunction in 1997 to bar Shayler
from disclosing any information he obtained while working for the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler, 33 worked for MI5, the internal security agency, from
1994 until 1997. He came to public attention in 1997 when he
claimed that the agency kept files on a number of politicians
including the current home secretary, Jack Straw, and the Northern
Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said Britain was involved in a plot to assassinate
the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler was arrested in France in 1998 on a British warrant, but
a French appeals court rejected an extradition bid. He could face
charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act, but says he is
determined to return to Britain later this year to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler maintains that his book, ''The Organisation,'' is a work
of fiction. It is being billed as ''a gritty thriller about spies,
sex and football.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said the government is persecuting Shayler by insisting
his book is first read by censors.
</P>
<P>
   ''For fiction to be subject to vetting at all obviously
contravenes freedom of expression and human rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government also recently filed a civil lawsuit against
Shayler, accusing him of violating his contract and copyright laws
by releasing secret documents to British newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Disrupt German Expo 2000  </HEADLINE>
By ANTJE SCHWARZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP) -- Protesters angry over the $1.8 billion
spent on Germany's first-ever World's Fair disrupted the grand
opening Thursday by blocking a road and railway lines to the
fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Expo No'' posters were visible around the entrance as German
President Johannes Rau cut a red ribbon and officially declared the
Expo 2000 open.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder declared the
extravaganza ''a great mixture of entertainment and educational
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Many opening day visitors were delayed by protesters who laid
burning tires on rail lines heading to Hanover from the north and
south. Both stretches were blocked for up to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 protesters also briefly blocked a pedestrian bridge
over an access road to the fairgrounds, chaining themselves
together with bicycle locks. Some also lowered themselves on cords
onto the street below, forcing officials to stop traffic for a
time. Other demonstrators set about 30 trash containers on fire and
damaged ticket machines.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six protesters were temporarily detained, a police
spokesman said. An additional 100 protesters were detained later in
downtown Hanover when they occupied a small casino.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of protesters have campaigned against the Expo for
weeks, charging that the money could have been better spent on
Germany's cash-strapped education system.
</P>
<P>
   The five-month fair is expected to lose money despite estimates
of up to 25 million visitors paying ticket prices of up to $42.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying on a tradition begun in 1851, the fair features
exhibits by 155 countries plus Germany -- but not the United States,
a no-show for the first time after too few corporate sponsors
signed up.

<HEADLINE> Only Female 3-Star General Leaves  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, who drew national
attention for making a sexual harassment charge against a fellow
general, is leaving the Army on Friday, 31 years to the day she
entered.
</P>
<P>
   Although her formal retirement will come in August, Friday will
be Kennedy's last day of work. She has been the Army's deputy chief
of staff for intelligence since May 1997 and is the Army's only
female three-star general.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's departure plans were set before her accusation of
sexual harassment became public in March.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Army plans to honor her at a ceremony to be
presided over by Army Secretary Louis Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kennedy nor the man she accused of making an unwanted
sexual advance in her Pentagon office -- Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith --
has spoken publicly about the case. Calls to Kennedy's office are
routinely referred to the Army's public affairs office, which says
it cannot discuss the substance of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Army investigators informed the service's leaders
that they had substantiated Kennedy's charge that Smith had touched
her in an inappropriate way during a meeting in her office in 1996.
Smith, who reportedly has denied making a sexual advance, has been
given a chance to challenge the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy has not publicly discussed her case, she
alluded to the issue of sexual harassment during remarks May 12 at
a ceremony at the memorial to Women in Military Service to America,
at Arlington National Cemetery. She said women who are harassed
should report it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''If discrimination or misconduct is not reported at an
appropriate time, then public policy may never change,'' Kennedy
said at the May 12 event. She quoted French novelist Emile Zola as
saying he lived on earth ''to live out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Living out loud begins by telling a friend and then later
telling people in authority who care,'' Kennedy said. ''Our Army is
filled with women and men who care and are in a position to change
and improve the conditions in which we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own case, Kennedy did not report Smith's alleged
harassment to her superiors at the time. She raised the matter
internally only last fall after the Army announced that Smith was
to become the Army's deputy inspector general. In that post he
would have overseen investigations of cases of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Army quietly rescinded Smith's assignment, and
his official status is ''on hold,'' according to Army personnel
records.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 52, is to be succeeded in the post of deputy chief of
staff for intelligence by Robert W. Noonan, whom President Clinton
has nominated for promotion to the rank of lieutenant general.

<HEADLINE> Jenoff admits role in slaying of rabbi's wife  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A private investigator who says he was hired
by Rabbi Fred Neulander to kill his wife admitted his role in the
attack Thursday, agreeing to testify against his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter, Leonard Jenoff
said he would help prosecutors in their bid to send Neulander and
another man to prison for the Nov. 1, 1994 slaying of Carol
Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, who originally was charged with murder and conspiracy to
commit murder, could face less than two years in prison, depending
on how cooperative he is in the prosecutions of Neulander and Paul
Michael Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken, Jenoff's alleged accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   His sentencing was delayed until after the cases against Daniels
and Neulander are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, admitted hitting Mrs. Neulander in the back of the
head with a lead pipe in her Cherry Hill home. He provided no other
details -- about the attack or his alleged $30,000 fee -- during his
appearance before Superior Court Judge Linda Rosenzweig.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rabbi, Mr. Neulander, had paid me to arrange for his
wife's murder,'' Jenoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 58, who founded Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue
with his wife in 1974, allegedly wanted his wife of 29 years dead
so he could continue having an affair with Philadelphia radio
personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   He believed a divorce would jeopardize his position as senior
rabbi at the synagogue. He resigned three months after the killing,
however, after reports surfaced about two extramarital affairs he'd
allegedly had with members of his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, who wasn't charged in the killing until 1998, says he
had nothing to do with it. He was not present in court Thursday
when Jenoff entered his plea, but his lawyers were.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Jenoff a liar, Neulander attorney Jeffrey Zucker
insisted that the killing was for reasons that had nothing to do
with Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he killed her, it was for his own motives and had nothing
to do with Fred Neulander,'' Zucker said in an interview outside
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, a native of Atlantic City who named teaching history as
his career ambition in his high school yearbook, worked as a
private investigator for various lawyers in southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed to the killing in April, telling a newspaper
reporter about his role and saying that he could no longer live
with the burden of the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the judge Thursday, shackled at the waist and
wearing orange Camden County jail-issue clothes, he answered
questions posed to him by Rosenzweig and First Assistant Camden
County Prosecutor James P. Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The Neulanders' son, Matthew, sat in the gallery with about 10
other relatives. They declined comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff faces 10 to 30 years in prison for the killing. If he
gets the minimum, he could be freed on parole in one year, 11
months and one day, Rosenzweig said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the state was reserving judgment on a sentence
recommendation until after the other cases are heard. Daniels'
lawyer says his client, too, is likely to plead guilty in the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff lawyer Francis Hartman acknowledged that Jenoff's
credibility will be a central issue in the trial of Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   But he disputed Zucker's comments about Jenoff, saying it was
pretrial posturing.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client is so damaging to his that he has to attack him.
This is the traditional bravado of a defense lawyer trying to
shield his client from the inevitable consequences of his
actions,'' Hartman said outside court.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for Neulander's trial. A conference to
discuss the trial schedule is set for Sept. 5. Lynch said no
decision has been made on whether to seek the death penalty against
Neulander.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LE ROY, N.Y. (AP) -- A truck slammed into an unoccupied
tractor-trailer parked on the side of the New York state Thruway,
killing the driver, spilling a hazardous cargo and backing up
rush-hour traffic for miles Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The tractor-trailer had pulled off the highway after striking a
deer and the driver apparently had walked off to seek help, state
police said. A truck crashed into its rear around 8 a.m. some eight
miles west of the Le Roy exit and 25 miles southwest of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Killed was Joseph Price III, 49, of Long Pond, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were summoned to contain chlorine that spilled
along with diesel fuel from the wreckage of the parked truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to contain it as soon as possible and keep it away
from the diesel, which will cause it to explode,'' Batavia Fire
Chief Frank Riccobone told the Daily News of Batavia.
</P>
<P>
   Westbound lanes of the highway were closed for about five hours.

<HEADLINE> Car accident kills two state troopers  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HURLEY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two state troopers, looking for
aggressive drivers on a winding, two-lane road, died Wednesday
night when they tried to make a U-turn and were hit broadside by a
tractor trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Trustcott ''Michael'' Kelly, 49, and Kenneth A. Poormon, 23,
were killed in the 7:40 p.m. crash on Route 28 near Kingston, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck's driver, 53-year-old Robert Kothe Jr. of West Hurley,
suffered cuts to his head and was released from a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Kelly was driving the patrol car east on Route 28
when he pulled to the southern shoulder and began a U-turn to
pursue another vehicle. Kothe, also headed east, hit the cruiser in
the driver's side door and pushed it down a steep embankment off
the north side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Both troopers were pronounced dead at the scene. Major Alan G.
Martin, commander of Troop F, said it appears both men were wearing
seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   The speed limit on that stretch of Route 28 is 55 mph. Martin
said Kothe has cooperated fully with investigators, providing blood
and urine samples and allowing an examination by a drug recognition
expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we have no reason to suspect there was any
alcohol or drugs involved,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the tractor trailer was in ''reasonably good shape''
and had no overt evidence of an unsafe condition that could have
led to the accident. A reconstruction expert will determine the
truck's speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very, very dark day for the state police,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly spent his entire 22-year career in the Kingston barracks
and his most recent assignment was to the Community Stabilization
Team, concentrating primarily on aggressive driving in the Route 28
area. An avid runner and cyclist, he organized the police torch run
for The Special Olympics. He leaves a wife and two children, ages
17 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   Poormon graduated from the New York State Police Academy in
November, trained in Auburn and was transferred to Kingston in
March. He is survived by his parents.
</P>
<P>
   The road, long a safety concern for local police, was closed for
several hours after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will be in my thoughts and prayers, as well as those of
all New Yorkers,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said in a statement.
''Their loss is deeply felt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ... stunned, stunned,'' Kingston City Police Chief Gerald
Keller said. ''It's one of the most horrible things to happen to
the police community around here in a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the state police was founded in 1917, 108 officers have
been killed in the line of duty, 60 in motor vehicle accidents,
according to the New York State Police website. Of the 60 killed,
many were on motorcycles and some in their personal vehicles on
their way to or from work.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Brooklyn, a police officer and the driver of a
newspaper delivery truck were killed in a violent pre-dawn
collision as the police officer and his partner sped to answer a
report of a man with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   West Hurley is 48 miles south of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Post office issues letter of apology to DRS commissioner  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Department of Revenue Services
commissioner said he is proud of the U.S. Postal Service for owning
up to the slow certified mail service that left state income tax
payments unprocessed for two weeks last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did the talk,'' Gene Gavin said Thursday. ''I want them
to do the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavin received a letter of apology dated May 26 from Jon M.
Steele, the post office's vice president for Northeast Area
Operations. The apology came in response to the May 11 letter Gavin
sent to Postmaster General William Henderson asking that the
certified mail process be improved nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''This failure caused you embarrassment and loss of use of
funds,'' Steele wrote. ''I can personally assure you that will
never happen again. It should not have happened this one time. It
was wrong, and we have taken corrective action.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax returns sent by certified mail included a $10 million
check.
</P>
<P>
   Those words -- along with the post office's pledge that come next
tax season more workers will be employed to process the certified
mail -- have satisfied Gavin. And DRS and post office officials are
set to meet together three more times before the start of the next
tax season, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''They stepped up,'' Gavin said. ''They recognized there were
some problems in their handling of certified mail. I couldn't get a
better letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford post office plans to employ six people on three
shifts -- for a total of 18 workers -- to handle the certified mail
next spring, said Christine Dugas, a spokeswoman with the U.S.
Postal Service. This year, two employees working on two shifts --
for a total of four workers -- handled the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides are very committed to solving the problem,'' Dugas
said, adding that the post office also will continue to communicate
daily with the DRS.
</P>
<P>
   The DRS has battled with the post office since 1987 for faster
certified mail processing, Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The state received more tax payments this year, likely because
of capital gains. Typically, large checks, like the one for $10
million, are received by certified mail.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tax deadline was April 18, but according to the
president of the Hartford postal workers' union, mail was piling up
weeks before that date. The mail was there April 12, although the
postal service didn't start processing it until two weeks later,
said Stephen R. Peters, president of Hartford Local 147 of the
American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The DRS received 46,270 pieces of certified mail from May 2-6,
with checks estimated at about $120 million. The extra money was
not discovered until after the Legislature had approved a budget
and agreed on how to spend the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Nancy Wyman has projected a $413.4 million
budget surplus by the end of the Fiscal Year 2000 -- due in part to
the mail delay. Wyman also attributed the surplus to Connecticut's
stronger-than-expected economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Tries To Curb Drug Costs  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is taking action to try to
lower taxpayers' costs for drugs covered by Medicaid and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala sent letters
to Capitol Hill on Thursday telling lawmakers that Medicare claims
processors will be encouraged to lower reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   The lower rates would be based on new drug price estimates
resulting from ongoing federal investigations of the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now moving administratively to take advantage of the
newly available more accurate data on average wholesale prices
developed for Medicaid as a result of Department of Justice
investigations,'' wrote Shalala to House Commerce Committee
Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley had written to Shalala and to several pharmaceutical
companies recently expressing concern about high drug prices paid
by government health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., another concerned lawmaker, said
''The timing of this policy announcement is particularly important
in view of the current debate about adding a (broader) prescription
drug benefit to Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for the elderly
and disabled, currently covers very few drugs -- generally, only
those that must be administered by a doctor, such as chemotherapy
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is a state-federal partnership program providing health
care for low-income Americans and covers a much wider array of
prescriptions that can be purchased at pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs have long based reimbursement rates for drugs on
industry guidebooks that list so-called average wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators say that those prices are often much
higher than what doctors and pharmacies actually pay, however.
</P>
<P>
   The HHS Inspector General has estimated that Medicare pays from
11 to 900 percent more for drugs than what it costs doctors to buy
them. Similar price discrepancies have been found between Medicaid
reimbursements and what drug stores pay.
</P>
<P>
   The result: health care providers pocket the difference at a
cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to Medicare and Medicaid
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under government pressure, a California company called First
Data Bank, which provides a drug price guide known as the ''Blue
Book'' to Medicaid, agreed to lower its list prices for 50 drugs in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The lower prices reflect insight federal investigators have
gleaned from drug wholesalers' catalogs and other marketing
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said in her letter that HHS will encourage Medicare
claims processors to use the new, lower list prices, as well. But
current regulations do not require the use of the Blue Book over
other industry guides.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are attempting to meet with the company that publishes the
''Red Book'' which is the source of average wholesale price data
that most (Medicare) carriers have used to date,'' Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, federal and state prosecutors are continuing to
pursue possible legal action against drug companies, alleging that
they purposely inflate prices reported to the industry guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have denied wrongdoing, saying the government has
long known that guidebook prices are only rough estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to cut Medicare
reimbursements for drugs to 83 percent of guidebook prices. In
1997, lawmakers agreed to legislation cutting the reimbursements to
95 percent from 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> Woo Comforted Cruise Mom Over Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Director John Woo had a mission to comfort Tom
Cruise's mother when he sent his leading man up a cliff for a
dizzying climbing scene. It turned out to be mission impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's finally calming down and she's trying to pretend she's
not scared, so she kept smiling at me,'' as they watched the
''Mission Impossible 2'' star climb an overhanging cliff some 2,000
feet above ground without a safety net, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I was more panicked then her, so I grabbed hold of her
hand, turned to her, and said, 'Mom, he's going to be fine,' and
actually I was the one worried,'' Woo recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise did that stunt seven times, and his mother and Woo
''worried 70 times,'' the director told reporters in Hong Kong. ''I
kept sweating. I closed my eyes and prayed to God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong director came home with Cruise to promote the
action-packed sequel to the 1996 blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise insisted on doing all the stunts, said Woo, who made his
name making shoot-'em-up Hong Kong gangster movies before going to
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The film is his babe, and he wanted to do the best,'' Woo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise, on his second trip here, said he looks forward to
working with Woo again.
</P>
<P>
   ''He takes action and elevates beyond the way that we knew
before,'' Cruise said.

<HEADLINE> Owner of residential care home convicted in kickback scheme  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The owner of a state-funded home for
disabled and elderly residents was convicted Thursday of taking
kickbacks from employees.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement with the state, Camille Frosolone of Guilford
won't have to serve the 5-year prison sentence that comes with her
conviction of second-degree larceny. But she must reimburse her
employees $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone will also be required to pay the state up to $200,000
for the schemes she ran at Yorkshire Manor in East Haven, said
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Frosolone and her chief bookkeeper, Dawn Pascale,
are banned from operating any state-funded facility or program for
the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The state is taking control of the facility, and will sell it to
a new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the health and safety
of the 20 elderly and disabled residents at Yorkshire Manor were
not in jeopardy because of the scams Frosolone ran between 1995 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no indication that care was compromised,'' Blumenthal
said. ''But state dollars were spent for kickbacks, for padded
payrolls, for concealment of expenses that simply didn't occur.''
</P>
<P>
   An audit by the state Department of Social Services and
investigations by the chief state's attorney and attorney general
revealed that Frosolone muscled about a dozen Yorkshire Manor
employees to pay her a part of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people needed the jobs, and paying the kickbacks was how
they kept them,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The state probes also turned up evidence that people were being
paid for no-show jobs, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone was charged in November with first-degree larceny by
defrauding a public community, lesser larceny charges and three
counts of receiving kickbacks. Under her settlement with the state,
Frosolone pleaded no contest to one charge of second-degree
larceny. She is scheduled to be sentenced June 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was financially impossible for Camille to fight the state
of Connecticut in a trial,'' Frosolone's lawyer, William Bloss
said. ''By pleading no contest, she maintains that she did nothing
wrong criminally.''
</P>
<P>
   Yorkshire Manor provides housing and care to elderly, disabled
and mentally handicapped people. It is reimbursed through monthly
payments its residents receive from Social Security and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone purchased the facility in 1991 from Dawn Pascale's
father, William. At the same time, Frosolone and Dawn Pascale had a
romantic relationship and co-owned the Haven Rest Home in New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone and Dawn Pascale hid their relationship from the state
in order to get a higher reimbursement rate from DSS. The agency
told William Pascale that if his facility were sold to a related or
connected party, the new owner would not be eligible for the higher
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting people on notice -- especially nursing homes who
are taking care of our loved ones, our elderly,'' said Chief
State's Attorney John Bailey. ''That if you try to do this --
defraud the state of Connecticut or not give proper care -- you're
going to be arrested.''

<HEADLINE> Hormones Said Raising Breast Cancers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Use of a hormone-replacement therapy with
estrogen and progestin can more than double the risk of a form of
breast cancer, researchers reported today in the journal Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center studied
537 Seattle-area women at least 50 years old who had breast cancer
from 1988 to 1990. They were compared with 492 women who had not
had the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists found a 2.6-fold higher incidence of lobular breast
cancer in women who took the combination therapy for at least six
months and an average of four years.
</P>
<P>
   The reason only one form of cancer increased is ''a question for
the future: Do some women have certain characteristics that make
them more susceptible to lobular cancer when using replacement
therapy?'' said Dr. Christopher Li, the study's lead author.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of breast cancer cases are in the ducts that
carry milk to the nipple. Lobular cancer occurs in the
milk-producing lobules and affects about 10 percent of
breast-cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   About 8.6 million women in the United States take the
combination therapy treatment, and 12 million take estrogen alone.
</P>
<P>
   The hormones reduce the risk of broken bones from osteoporosis
and ease menopausal symptoms. In women who have not had a
hysterectomy, progestin is used to lower the risk of endometrial
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies, including two this year, indicated a heightened
risk of breast cancer among women using combination hormone therapy
for at least five years but not among those using estrogen alone.
</P>
<P>
   In a related study, Li found a 35 percent increase in lobular
cancer between 1988 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although preliminary, our studies suggest that the incidence
of lobular breast cancer is increasing nationwide and that the use
of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, specifically the use
of combined estrogen plus progestin preparations, may be
contributing to this increase,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   He said more studies were required to confirm the findings.

<HEADLINE> Lyme Bacterium Needs No Iron  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The bacterium that causes Lyme disease has
been identified as the first disease-causing germ that does not
need to take iron from the blood stream of its host.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Gherardini of the University of Georgia said that
other bacteria that cause disease have evolved a strategy to
scavage from the blood of victims the iron that is essential to
their survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although iron is abundant in humans, the amount of free iron
is well below the levels required to support the growth of most
bacteria,'' Gherardini said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, apparently
evolved a biological strategy that does not need iron, thus
avoiding the problems that other bacteria have in getting iron from
the blood stream.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, iron is extremely toxic to it,'' Gherardini said.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the study appears Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is caused by a microbe that is spread to humans
through a tick bite. The disease can cause headache, fever, stiff
joints and fatigue. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   In another study of a tick-borne disease, scientists at the
University of Minnesota School of Medicine and the Northwestern
University School of Medicine have found a key step in the
infection process of a disease called Human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis, or HGE.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers report in Science that the bacterium that causes
HGE infects neutrophils, which are cells in the immune system. The
germ gets into the cells by making a molecule that mimics a natural
molecule called P-selectin that is normally absorbed into
neutrophils.
</P>
<P>
   When the bacterium molecule links to a P-selectin receptor on
the cell surface, the germ is able to enter the cell and start the
disease process.
</P>
<P>
   HGE infection often accompanies Lyme disease. Both are carried
by ticks. HGE causes high fever and headache. It is treated with
antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> GOP primary contenders set for final debate in race for U.S. Senate </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- The four Republicans running for the
U.S. Senate nomination have one last chance in a debate Thursday to
build their credibility and to diminish that of their opponents
with five days left before the June 6 primary.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, and state Sen. William
Gormley, R-Atlantic, stand as the perceived front-runners by virtue
of their moderate views, their county endorsements, in which Franks
has an edge, and their money, in which Gormley has an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree the contest is close. The only polls of the GOP race
have shown it to be virtually too close to call, especially with
the likelihood of a low voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Executive Jim Treffinger, who along with the
leaders has raised more than $1 million, is cutting into Franks'
base. To lay claim to the conservative wing of the party,
Treffinger has been waging a one-man war of words with the fourth
candidate, Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin, a former
Libertarian who stands alone in opposition to abortion and to all
gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   A lively topic among them is likely to be the other side of the
aisle, where Democratic hopeful Jon Corzine has shattered national
spending records with a flurry of TV commercials and opponent Jim
Florio has been raising alarms that Corzine is a threat to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is scheduled to be held at the Jewish Community
Center. It is will tentatively begin between 7:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.
depending on the arrival of all the candidates. It will be held
before a live audience that will be able to submit questions, but
it is the only debate of the five in the GOP primary contest that
will not be broadcast.

<HEADLINE> Raffi Pulls Out of Canada Festival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER (AP) -- Raffi, the Canadian children's entertainer, is
pulling out of this week's Vancouver International Children's
Festival because it's become too commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arts for young audiences and corporate ads don't mix,'' Raffi
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The popular singer-author said he was appalled when he went to
the festival site Monday and saw a big display from Kia Motors, the
Korean automaker which is the event's largest corporate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Raffi, whose full name is Raffi Cavoukian, canceled the four
performances he was to give Friday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Festival Chairman Jean Riou said he was sorry Raffi had chosen
to end his long association with the event, saying: ''The festival
regrets that Raffi has chosen this means to express his views on
corporate sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which began in 1978 and attracts upward of 70,000
people annually, features free and paid concerts for toddlers to
early teens, as well as puppeteers, jugglers, storytellers and
roving minstrels.

<HEADLINE> Cubans See Change Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- From cab stands to the halls of power, an increase
in Americans coming to see Cuba for themselves -- both officials and
tourists -- is making Cubans optimistic that the U.S. effort to
isolate this country doesn't have long to last.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with three members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
Cuban Economics Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez estimated more than
65,000 Americans visited Cuba last year, part of an annual 20
percent increase in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100,000 naturalized Americans who were born in Cuba and
are still considered by this government to be Cuban citizens
visited in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Felipe Perez Roque noted he had
met with leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday and
that members of the Arkansas congressional delegation were just
finishing a visit with Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say they are viewing the growing relationship as
the best chance in years to ease tensions between the countries and
a prelude to renewed trade and normalized relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any change will take some time,'' Perez Roque told caucus
members, Reps. James Cleburne, D-S.C., Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.,
and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Roque said Cuba wouldn't be the only beneficiary if trade
were opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would create for the American population a lot more job
opportunities. What I'm saying would have to be proved out but it
makes sense,'' Perez Roque said.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Caucus members said they welcomed the possibility of a
first step -- relaxing the U.S. embargo to allow food and medicine
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   They expressed concerns, however, that blacks in both countries
could end up with a sliver of the economic rewards if large
American firms dictate terms of trade between the United States and
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote later this month on a provision in an
agricultural bill to license U.S. sales of food and medicine to
Cuba as long as they aren't subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to encourage the companies to be diverse in their
structure, otherwise the most supportive groups of trade to Cuba
(in America) will be left out of the trade business. Many companies
will come to make money without caring about black people in
America,'' Thompson told the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Roque said his worries were unfounded, recounting Cuba's
history of aiding poor black nations like Haiti with massive
exports of Cuban doctors and Cuba's deployment of troops to
Southern African nations like Angola during liberation struggles
there.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Roque said 2,000 Cubans died in the fighting. ''We weren't
there for mines or diamonds,'' he said. ''We didn't do it out of
economic interest, but we did it because of our convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister then gave the congressmen a personal
testament he said reflected his country's commitment to racial
equity.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Roque rubbed his forearm for emphasis and said: ''This
white Cuban has a black wife. We are proud of our mixed condition
in this country. Our revolution was made so that all people of all
color are treated the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The embargo, creating a barrier between Cuba and the United
States, was imposed on Cuba 38 years ago by John F. Kennedy after
Fidel Castro won the revolution and revealed his communist
leanings.
</P>
<P>
   Through fatter tips and growing numbers of American passengers,
a cab driver who works outside the posh Hotel Nacional measures the
change sweeping his country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally have driven for seven members of your Congress in
the last few weeks alone -- seven -- and many more tourists as well.
I did not know our beaches had grown so popular to Americans,''
beamed Raul, the 31-year-old native of Old Havana. He spoke in
halting English and didn't want his last name used.
</P>
<P>
   Mari, 23, who drives the yellow, egg-shaped cabs called ''coco
taxis'' that run along Havana's Malecon seawall, shares Raul's
view. Taking a short respite from running tourists to a local arts
fair, she joked in fractured English, ''Soon, I'll be talking more
English that Spanish here. I need lessons.''

<HEADLINE> Little Progress In Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians have little
to show for six months of peace treaty talks, and time is running
out for President Clinton to produce a deal that has become
increasingly elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of negotiating, Israelis and Palestinians have been
engaging in name-calling and accusing each other of foot-dragging
and intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak spent much of his meeting with
Clinton on Thursday in Lisbon complaining that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat was not making a serious effort to reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat responded, saying it was Israel that was stalling the
talks, not the Palestinians. ''They are the side that is wasting
time and not moving toward peace,'' Arafat said Thursday in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is upset that Israel has not released Palestinian
security prisoners, handed over three West Bank villages near
Jerusalem and withdrawn from additional West Bank land ahead of a
final accord, Barak was told, according to a senior Israeli
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listened to Barak, as he had earlier to Arafat on the
phone on Wednesday, but didn't take sides or present his own
bridging proposals, seen by both sides as a prerequisite for
breaking the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The president was upbeat, saying an accord was within sight. But
Clinton apparently will decide on whether to fully engage as a
negotiator only after his Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright visit the region next week. With
presidential elections in November, the president doesn't have much
time left to help broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Left to their own devices, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
have been unable to overcome deep suspicions about each other's
true intentions. They have made no measurable progress since peace
treaty talks began in November.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat insists that Israel's outstanding debts, including a
withdrawal from an unspecified chunk of land in the West Bank, must
be settled before talks can move on to reaching a blueprint for a
final treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Barak says getting bogged down now on interim issues, such as a
partial pullback, is a waste of time better spent tackling key
issues, such as drawing final borders. A Barak aide argued that in
any event, the Palestinians would get more land as a result of a
treaty framework than in yet another interim troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   While both leaders say they are committed to reaching an
agreement, they may also be deeply afraid of it. The concessions
required to strike an accord would be hugely unpopular among large
segments of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat could expect an outcry across the Muslim world if he
waters down Palestinian demands of control of east Jerusalem, home
to major Islamic shrines. Barak, in turn, would face heavy
criticism at home if he grants the Palestinians a foothold in the
disputed city.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating those constraints, Barak made a quick trip to
Portugal and back on Thursday -- 11 hours in the air, four on the
ground -- so he could be home by nightfall to attend Jerusalem Day
festivities, marking the capture of the eastern sector from Jordan
in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently feared that his absence could have served as
fodder for hard-liners who claim he will relinquish part of
Jerusalem in a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent references to domestic constraints also serve as a
negotiating tactic, with both leaders rejecting concessions with
claims that their constituents wouldn't stand for them.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told Clinton this week that the Palestinians could not
settle for anything less than getting all of the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and east Jerusalem -- the areas Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast war -- since Syria was being offered a return of virtually
all the land it lost to Israel at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in turn, cited Israelis' emotional attachment to
Jerusalem as a reason for rejecting compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only one who does not understand the depth of the feeling of
the Jewish people for Jerusalem ... can even consider the
possibility of an Israeli concession in part of Jerusalem,'' Barak
said in his Jerusalem Day speech.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Inmate advocate barred from state prisons  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An inmate advocate has been barred from
state prisons for what administrators contend was her role in
fomenting unrest among prisoners in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   State Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord wrote Alice Green on
May 9 saying she was ''correct'' to surmise that she and her staff
at the Albany-based Center for Law &AMP; Justice ''are being denied
access'' to state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Green said she has been unable to get into a state prison since
last year. Scheduled visits since then seemed to fall through at
the last second or invitations from prison groups were rescinded,
Green complained. She said Wednesday that Goord's letter was in
response to a month's worth of daily calls to the commissioner's
office seeking to determine if prisons were indeed off-limits to
her and others in her group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am really disturbed about it,'' she said Wednesday. ''It
affects the work that we do. I have been working in the prisons for
a little over 20 years and never had any incidents, never did
anything wrong. It is hurting the families of prisoners and
prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Goord said he considers Green and others in her group a ''clear
threat to the safety and security of correctional employees and
inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Goord charged that Green's group encouraged
inmates to strike on or around Jan. 1, 2000, to protest state
parole policies, prison labor issues and other grievances prisoners
have against the way state prisons are run.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to the professionalism, vigilance and dedication of
department employees, the action was averted, albeit at a cost to
the taxpayers of millions of dollars,'' Goord said.
</P>
<P>
   The state mobilized all 1,000 members of its SWAT-like emergency
response teams and stationed them near prisons throughout the state
to deal with possible strikes. They were never called into
facilities to quell any violence or other disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors began to circulate widely as 1999 came to a close about a
planned strike by some inmates to coincide with problems facilities
might experience due to the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   No such computer problems occurred, nor did inmate strikes come
off, though the Sing Sing and Green Haven prisons were locked down
prior to Jan. 1 because of weapons and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Green said it is ''totally ridiculous'' that she agitated in
favor of an inmate strike, though she acknowledges being
sympathetic to prison complaints about parole and prison labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a prisoner rights advocacy group,'' Green said. ''But I
in no way did anything inside the prison or outside the prison to
encourage it (the strike).''
</P>
<P>
   Goord did not say how long Green would be banned from prisons,
but Green said she assumed it will go on for as long as he is
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Prison system spokesman James Flateau said Green is the only
person currently barred from New York prisons as a possible
security risk to inmates and staff.
</P>
<P>
   New York law gives the state's prison commissioner wide
discretion to decide who and who does not get to visit facilities.

<HEADLINE> State, local officials praise fire response  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- An investigation indicates the two
inmates injured in a fire at the Northern Correctional Institution
set the items inside their cell ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Heather Ziemba could not say what two men used to start
the fire Wednesday night or how they got the materials. Smoking is
not allowed in Connecticut prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Sostre, 25, is awaiting trial for the Jan. 23, 1999 fatal
shooting of East Hartford police Officer Brian Aselton. He was
treated at Johnson Memorial Hospital for smoke inhalation. Pedro
Poupart, 18, a New Haven man serving 17 months for assault on a
police or fire officer, was being treated for minor burns at the
MacDougall Correctional Institution in Suffield.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines, papers, boxes, mattresses and bedding were set ablaze
in the fire, which guards spotted during routine rounds about 7:45
p.m. in a unit housing about 50 inmates, including residents of
Connecticut's death row.
</P>
<P>
   Six guards used extinguishers to largely doused the flames. When
30 firefighters arrived about 10 minutes later, the fire was
smoldering and the inmates had been moved to another area of the
prison, Somers fire Chief Bill Meier said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cell was fully involved, but the fire did not spread, Meier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both prison and municipal officials said planned emergency
procedures were followed and worked well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went like clockwork,'' said Somers First Selectman Gordon
Mello, who was leading a town meeting on funding for a new million
firehouse when his emergency pager went off. ''The first thought
that ran through my mind was 'Gee, I hope this is a test.' Then I
heard the sirens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziemba said that at no time was public safety threatened or the
security of the prison compromised. The evacuated prisoners were
held in other secure areas of the prison for about four hours, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The firefighters never felt threatened at all,'' Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   A third inmate, Julio Gomez, 29, was treated at Johnson Memorial
after he became unruly during the evacuation and was subdued with
pepper spray, Ziemba said. The Meriden man is serving three years
for violation of probation; his record includes burglary, larceny
and drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was being evacuated for his safety and he was
noncompliant,'' Ziemba said. ''In order to get him under control
and protect him, he was restrained with pepper spray.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire marked the first time the town's firefighters were
called to the prison since 1997, when the Department of Correction
disbanded its fire department. The prison houses more than 430 of
Connecticut's worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Meier said his department is not usually called to minor fires
at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the fact that we were responding led us to believe it was
a bigger fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the first selectman said the public was never at risk and he
remained at the town meeting, where officials gave final approval
to a $2.2 million firehouse already under construction
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt very comfortable continuing my duties,'' Mello said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft official speaks at Technology 2000 conference  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- Companies must embrace information
technology and the Internet in order to attract and retain
customers, a Microsoft executive told a group of business
executives Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Werner, regional marketing manager of Microsoft's
eBusiness Solutions Group, said many companies are having a
difficult time keeping up with technology and their competition.
</P>
<P>
   But he said doing business on the Internet is critical for
companies who hope to attract and retain customers in today's
Web-driven world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective is creating a faster-moving organization that's
really efficient,'' Werner said, speaking to a group of about 270
business leaders at the Connecticut Business &AMP; Industry
Association's ''Technology 2000'' conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said many companies still face the task of getting the needed
support from upper management.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be shocking to you the number of CFOs and CEOs that
we do business with that don't even own a PC,'' he said. ''That's
really kind of sad because that's reflected in their businesses a
lot of time, so you need to make sure that you're bringing your
management teams along as you may be developing your IT restructure
yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As more and more companies use the Web to do business, customers
have new buying expectations, including delivery of information any
time, any place and on any device, Werner said.
</P>
<P>
   Werner joked about the Justice Department's highly publicized
drive to break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   After state Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen spoke to the
crowd about Connecticut's difficulty in attracting enough
information technology workers, Werner said Microsoft has several
things in common with Connecticut, including an ''image problem''
and ''a problem in getting the legislature or the government to
understand their position.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Again, I think we share that common concern with the state,''
Werner joked.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the judge in the Microsoft case granted a Justice
Department request for more time to explore possible areas of
agreement on secondary issues.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft filed a legal brief Thursday that attacked the
government's proposal to break the Redmond, Wash., corporation into
two companies. There was no indication the government would
compromise on the basic proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled April 3 that Microsoft had engaged illegally in
anticompetitive marketing practices. As a penalty, the Justice
Department and 17 states said Microsoft should be split into two
parts -- one that would develop and market the various Windows
operating systems, and the other that would take possession of
Microsoft Office and the company's various Internet properties.

<HEADLINE> HUD Files Discrimination Suit  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Housing and Urban Affairs Department has
filed housing discrimination charges on behalf of a non-renter --
the boyfriend of a tenant who claimed her landlord intimidated them
because they are a biracial couple.
</P>
<P>
   The charges -- the first of their kind to be pressed by HUD --
accuse landlord Thomas Nail of Starke, Fla., of threatening the
couple, raising the woman's rent and using racial slurs to harass
them. A civil suit, filed on behalf of couple by the Justice
Department, will be tried in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Hernandez, who is white, and her boyfriend, Gilbert
Wright, who is black, brought the complaint in October 1998.
Hernandez said the intimidation began shortly after she moved to
the single-family home in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nail would confront Hernandez after Wright's visits, she said,
which made the couple uncomfortable enough to meet in her home
secretly and at odd hours. Wright said he would hide in Hernandez's
closet to avoid Nail.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said Nail raised her monthly rent from $250 to $300
without reason and when the couple decided to move, tried to have
Wright arrested on a bogus accusation that he had stolen their
moving truck.
</P>
<P>
   HUD has also filed charges on behalf of Hernandez. The charges,
filed Wednesday, are the first brought on behalf of a non-renter
under the 32-year-old Fair Housing Act, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokeswoman Peggy Johannsen said that all discrimination
complaints must be investigated and go through mediation, which may
account for the time it took for HUD to file the charges in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   HUD investigates about one-third of roughly 11,000 Fair Housing
Act complaints it has received each year since 1996, Johannsen
said. Of those investigated, about 2,500 are complaints of racial
discrimination, she said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD files bias charges in about 300 cases each year, with the
remaining cases usually resolved through mediation.
</P>
<P>
   If Nail is found guilty, a federal court could award monetary
compensation for damages, mental distress, loss of housing rights
and court costs. It also could assess punitive damages if the
Justice Department, which is handling the case, finds a pattern of
housing discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fair Housing Act protects the right of any American to
live in any home and in any neighborhood that they can afford,''
said HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo. ''This department will continue to
aggressively pursue those who ignore the law and abrogate that
right.''

By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Displaying a new sense of boldness in dealing with
Germany's staunchest postwar ally, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
warned President Clinton on Thursday not to start another arms race
with a proposed new national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's proposal to build the system -- a scaled-down
version of the shield against incoming ballistic missiles once
championed by President Reagan in the 1980s -- represents for many
Germans the most serious split in thinking with the United States
since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stated my concerns, the concerns being that one must be very
careful that any process does not trigger a renewed arms race,''
Schroeder said after a two-hour meeting with Clinton that ran three
times longer than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Schroeder's concerns, National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said: ''We don't think that a limited system, particularly
if we proceed here in the context of a modified ABM Treaty ...
would ignite an arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   The national missile defense system would require amending the
landmark 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, which limits the
United States and Russia from building missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the ABM treaty authors envisioned that it would be
changed over time. ''It's not like the Ten Commandments, written in
stone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Europeans, Germans fear that the system would deal a
blow to nuclear weapons anti-proliferation efforts. Schroeder's
warning came just two days before Clinton heads to Moscow to meet
Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Germany, his fifth during his presidency, is
the second leg of a European trip meant to shore up trans-Atlantic
friendships. On Friday in Aachen, Clinton will be awarded the
International Charlemagne Award for U.S. contributions to postwar
European unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relationship the United States has with Germany has been
profoundly important for the last 50 years,'' Clinton told
reporters outside Schroeder's provisional offices in eastern
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think it may be even more important for the next 50
years, and I intend to do what ever I can in the time I have left
as president to make sure this relationship is on solid ground for
the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting signaled a deepening personal friendship. But it
also highlighted a growing number of issues that German pundits
fear threaten to fray the strong trans-Atlantic friendship.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Clinton pressed Schroeder about U.S.
concerns over the difficulty in settling international custody
cases in German courts that involve the children of American-German
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder promised to set up a group of government experts from
Germany and the United States to help resolve outstanding custody
battles and organize institutions that would help speed the
judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   Berger called Schroeder's proposal to deal with child custody
disputes was a ''good step.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several highly publicized cases in Germany,
including New Yorker Joseph Cooke's attempts to regain custody of
his two children placed in a foster home after their German mother
sought treatment for mental illness seven years ago. The problem of
messy international custody battles is particularly acute because
the decades-long presence of U.S. troops led to many
German-American marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Another important sticking point in U.S.-German relations is
compensation for Nazi-era slave and forced labor. While U.S. and
German negotiators had hoped Clinton could sign a statement
intended to protect German firms contributing to the fund from
class-action lawsuits in U.S. courts, disagreement over the wording
has held up a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the two leaders dined in a restaurant in part
of the former East Berlin that has undergone a lively renewal since
the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. Hundreds of people crowded outside
the restaurant -- pink-haired punks and yuppies sheathed in black --
all craning to catch a glimpse of Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Sudden arrest keeps ex-lover from court  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman who had an affair -- and a
daughter -- with Albert Pirro was prevented from confronting him at
federal court Thursday when she was arrested upon entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, husband of the Westchester district attorney, said he had
nothing to do with the arrest. He said he wouldn't have cared if
the woman, Jessica Marciano, had shown up as planned at the federal
courthouse in White Plains, where Pirro is on trial for alleged tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miss Marciano and that extremely unfortunate episode in my
life happened 17 years ago,'' he said after Thursday's court
session. ''It is a personal matter between my wife and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who attended the trial as
usual, would not comment on Marciano's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro complained that by linking the woman's paternity
case against him to the tax evasion trial, federal prosecutors were
aiding ''all the geeks out there trying to look into our personal
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers brought up the paternity case, which ended
when Pirro had his DNA tested and set up a trust fund for the girl,
because Pirro allegedly claimed business deductions for $70,000 in
related lawyers' and investigators' fees. In all, he and his
brother Anthony are accused of claiming more than $1 million in
personal spending as business deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano was arrested Wednesday at Newark International Airport
after she flew in from Great Britain with Pirro's 17-year-old
daughter. She told The Journal News that she had planned to attend
the trial at federal court in White Plains on Thursday and to
challenge allegations by Pirros' lawyers that she tried to extort
money from Pirro after their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Pitz, a Customs spokeswoman, said Marciano was taken
into custody on a warrant from Brevard County, Fla., that was
discovered when her name was routinely run through a computer. The
Brevard County sheriff's office said Marciano had failed to pay
back her victims after a grand-theft conviction, thereby violating
parole. An extradition hearing is scheduled in Newark on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano's fiancee, David Hutchison, alleged that Pirro was
behind the arrest, but Pirro called that ''absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an outstanding warrant, and it was just a question
of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to make sure that his daughter was taken care
of and he understood she was in Hutchison's care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest of it is just theater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Thursday, the deputy chief investigator in Jeanine
Pirro's office, Patrick Spatafore, testified that he runs a private
investigation company on the side. He said he was hired by Albert
Pirro to check for wiretaps on phone lines at the Harrison and
Manhattan homes of Marvin Singer, a friend of Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had the work done by two contractors -- one of them
another district attorney's investigator -- and submitted a bill for
$1,077.50 to Baumeister Enterprises, one of Pirro's companies, as
Pirro directed. That company then sent him a check for the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, prosecutors showed the jury an invoice from
Baumeister Enterprises to Singer's clothing company, Depeche Mode,
for an ''audio countermeasure survey'' for $2,693.75. Court papers
indicate they will claim that Pirro had the amount inflated,
possibly so Singer could claim a larger deduction.
</P>
<P>
   After Spatafore's testimony, defense lawyer Gustave Newman told
Judge Barrington Parker that it was ''so prejudicial, I
respectfully move for a mistrial.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Denied,'' the judge said.

<HEADLINE> Retired judge takes over as public safety commissioner  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A recently retired Superior Court judge
took over as the state's public safety commissioner Thursday,
replacing world-renowned forensics expert Henry Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur L. Spada, 68, was sworn in by Gov. John G. Rowland in
front of more than 100 state officials and well wishers at the
state Capitol. He retired from the bench last month to take the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Lee announced his retirement in April after a two-year stint as
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Among Spada's top priorities for the new job: improve public
safety on Connecticut's roads and highways, hire more state
troopers and make sure the state police force has updated equipment
and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to be a plotted plant,'' Spada said. ''I'm not
going to sit there as a ceremonial figure head. I expect to do work
and earn my keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Spada will serve on an interim basis until confirmed by the
General Assembly. Legislative leaders have said they expect Spada
to be easily OK'd for the $129,000 job. Spada said he expects to
hold the post for at least as long as Rowland is in office.
</P>
<P>
   Spada, who is best known for conducting a grand jury
investigation into Hartford police corruption, will oversee a
department that has a $114 million budget and more than 1,400
employees, most of whom are state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   A Hartford native who credits his upbringing in the city's
predominantly Italian-American East Side for his success, Spada
earned a law degree from the University of Connecticut School of
Law in 1957. Gov. Ella Grasso appointed him to the Superior Court
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to find somebody with stature, someone that would
have instant respect and credibility with our troopers as well as
the public, and Judge Spada met all of those recommendations,''
Rowland said.

<HEADLINE> As hurricane season arrives, resident recalls past horrors  </HEADLINE>
By MARIAN GAIL BROWN
Connecticut Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- From inside his mother's beachfront house,
Frank Bromley watched Long Island Sound's waters churn, rise and
slam ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The breeze that felt delightful a few minutes earlier was now
howling so hard that he could feel the skin on his face and his
clothing flap -- all this while indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the once-solid Silver Beach home in Milford began to
sway. The wood pilings shimmied. And the sky turned dark gray with
a pukey green undertone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The water and the wind got right out under the house and
lifted it off its foundation like it was nothing. Poof,'' Bromley
recalls. ''We were sitting at the kitchen table, me and my mother.
I can never forget that day. It was my 17th birthday: Sept. 21,
1938.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the day the house moved under Bromley's feet, and an
unnamed hurricane pummeled New England, killing 600 people, causing
$306 million in damages ($4.1 billion in 1996 dollars) and leveling
thousands of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sept. 21, 1938. It (the house) lifted off and went right out
to sea and we never found it,'' Bromley said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his mother escaped. But for months after the devastating
hurricane, bits and pieces of the big gray wood-frame house washed
ashore. Molding. Door knobs. Flooring.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains of Bromley's boyhood summer house are two
concrete steps that led to the front door. Where the house once
stood is a barren lot oddly sandwiched between two oversized
saltboxes that are now year-round homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bromley's mother, Elizabeth Winetta West, who owned about a
dozen houses along Silver Beach in Milford, was devastated by the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It broke her heart,'' Bromley said. ''She didn't want to have
any more of the beach after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks along the shore are hoping that they don't have to worry
about a similar storm this year. The hurricane season officially
kicks off Thursday and extends through November. And the forecast
from the country's pre-eminent hurricane expert, William Gray,
professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University,
calls for 11 named storms, seven hurricanes, three of them
considered ''intense events.''
</P>
<P>
   The predicted total is above the long-term average, but somewhat
lower than the number of storms that struck in four of the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gray and his colleagues believe there is a
higher-than-average chance of a major hurricane hitting land on the
East Coast and Florida peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane belt in the United States stretches from
Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Me., a span of 3,500 miles
encompassing some of the most developed waterfront properties and
densely populated urban areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As weather watchers, amateur armchair meteorologists and
hurricane experts ponder what Mother Nature has in store, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans to track
developing hurricanes and their storm paths on its Web site. And
several television stations in Connecticut and New York intend to
use the Internet similarly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Typically, it is next to impossible to forecast (hurricanes)
for New England. We are never in a direct path that we can say for
sure,'' said Gary Lessor, chief meteorologist with the Weather
Center at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury. ''As
much as I would like to forecast them, I won't go out on a limb
about hurricanes. They are a last-second event more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   To strike New England head on, Lessor said, a hurricane has to
have winds moving west to southwest. Complicating the question of
how robust this year's crop of hurricanes will be is the influence
of La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina is a condition of cooler-than-usual water in the Pacific
Ocean. Typically, during strong La Nina years, the Atlantic coast
has a better-than-average chance of hurricanes making landfall.
During El Nino years, when Pacific waters are warmer than usual,
the odds of having hurricanes in the Atlantic drop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, the general feeling as we move into summer is that
La Nina will begin to fade and we will move into a neutral area,
neither La Nina nor El Nino,'' said Brian Jarvinen, a hurricane
specialist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Great Hurricane of 1938, Connecticut also
took a pounding from Hurricane Diane on Aug. 19, 1955. Diane, a
category 1 storm that caused $831.7 million in damages, adjusts to
$4.8 billion in 1996 dollars, making it the sixth costliest
hurricane of all time, according to the National Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   As for the hurricane that Bromley and thousands of others
experienced in 1938, ''if you had that storm go through New England
today, you would probably have at least $10 billion or more in
damages,'' Jarvinen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that doesn't even fully adjust for new infrastructure and
new development. It would rank among the all-time worst
hurricanes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Bans Beer Vending Machines  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- It was a busy day Thursday at liquor stores across
Japan, where workers were dismantling a national institution bottle
by bottle: the beer vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of rampant alcoholism and underage drinking have forced
the country's liquor stores to adopt a voluntary ban on using the
machines. Shops complying with the plan pulled the plug late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move dealt a near death blow to alcohol vending machines,
which for decades have symbolized the Japanese penchant for
automated convenience -- and a taste for booze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I'm taking all the beer out -- and putting in the
juice,'' said Masayuki Murata as he stood beside an emptied machine
in front of his family's Surugaya Liquor Store in central Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The 130,000-member All Japan Liquor Merchants Association
estimated that up to 70 percent of the nation's 170,000 alcohol
vending machines were shut down by the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Allowances were made for stores that depend heavily on the
machines, which typically operate until 11 p.m. -- providing a quick
and easy drink for people who get off work after liquor stores
close.
</P>
<P>
   But the ban sent a clear message: beer from a machine is
becoming a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the vending machine itself is still going strong,
glowing on nighttime streets like beacons of commercialism and
convenience, selling everything from soda and juice to CDs and
videos.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on beer vending machines was aimed at cutting down on
underage drinking. Government statistics are spotty, but a
government survey in 1996 found more than half of male high school
seniors drank alcohol at least once or twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   Such students are typically 17 or 18 -- well below the drinking
age of 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a problem that children can buy something at a vending
machine that they can't buy face-to-face in a store,'' said Iwane
Matsui, chairman of the National Congress of PTA Associations of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking in general is a growing concern in Japan. Alcohol
consumption is surging especially among women, and inebriated
office workers are a common sight on nighttime streets and in
subways.
</P>
<P>
   The vending machine ban, however, was not expected to make much
of a dent on underage drinking. Convenience stores have been moving
into the beer-selling business in recent years and have been
criticized for selling alcohol without checking customers' IDs.
</P>
<P>
   The liquor store association is now pushing to get a law
proposed in Parliament that would crack down on stores that sell to
underage drinkers and tighten restrictions on liquor licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to take a good look at how we sell liquor in Japan,''
said Mamoru Tanaka, spokesman for the association.
</P>
<P>
   The vending machine ban could hit some liquor stores where it
hurts: the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Hachigo Murata, the owner of the tiny Surugaya Liquor Store,
said he was making about 10 percent of his sales on the cluster of
machines next to his shop. To make up for the shortfall, he plans
to stay open an hour later each night, until about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how customers are going to react,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those worries, the role of the beer vending machine has
declined in recent years, as convenience stores and large discount
shops that sell in bulk have moved in on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Japanese, beer fan Yasuo Kawabata said he just drives
to a local discount outlet, buys a case of brew and takes it home.
When he gets off work at night, a cold bottle is waiting for him in
the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are plenty of cheaper places where you can buy a lot,''
he said on Thursday on a Tokyo street. ''I almost never use a
vending machine, so the ban doesn't bother me at all.''

<HEADLINE> Advocates challenge NYC's enforcement of Kendra's Law  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City is seeking court orders to
force mentally ill people to take medication far more often than
other communities in the state are under Kendra's Law, an advocacy
group for the mentally ill said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Figures obtained from the state by the New York Association of
Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services show that of 74 individuals
facing court orders to take medication under Kendra's Law, 55 were
sought by New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative under Kendra's law is to offer the mentally ill
packages of voluntary enhanced services not including
court-mandated medicine-taking. Of the 317 people in that category,
only 31 are in New York City, the advocacy group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is really outrageous is that the city of New York has
proven non-responsive,'' the executive director of the Association
of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services, Harvey Rosenthal, said.
''The city of New York is not out there offering all kinds of
voluntary services packages.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of
Mental Health said she did not know how to explain the differing
proportions in how the city is enforcing Kendra's Law vs. counties
in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked hard to put into place a process that is
thorough, fair and objective,'' Anne Sommers said. ''We're bringing
into care people who were caught before in the revolving door. We
are helping people who had been lost before.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures are for between Nov. 8, when Kendra's Law went into
effect, and April 24, 2000, Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The law is named in honor of Kendra Webdale, who died after
being shoved in front of a subway train by a disturbed man who had
not been taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, whose group opposed the court-ordered medicating of
individuals, said the good that appears to be coming out of
Kendra's Law is that county health officials are being forced to
identify the people in their communities who need psychiatric
services the most.
</P>
<P>
   If the voluntary services packages are indeed voluntary and not
being accepted because a court order would follow, Rosenthal said
that is how the mental health system should have been working --
government recognizing the people who needed help and coming up
with ways to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 962 investigations of individuals were launched under
Kendra's Law between Nov. 8-April 24. The state reports that 571
were dismissed because no action was needed or are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Other counties outside New York City in which court orders were
secured for the medication of people were Suffolk (six);
Chautauqua, Orange, Nassau and Rockland (two each) and Cattaraugus,
Erie, Saratoga, Sullivan and Tompkins (one each).
</P>
<P>
   In starkest contrast to the administration of Kendra's Law by
New York City (55 court orders, 31 service arrangements) was Erie
County (one court order, 77 service arrangements), according to the
state figures.
</P>
<P>
   The first court challenge to Kendra's Law has been filed in
state Supreme Court in Brooklyn by the Long Island branch of Mental
Hygiene Legal Services. It charges New York City with failing to
demonstrate in two applications for court-ordered medication that
the people in question were too ill to make a reasoned decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said his group will join the claim in a
friend-of-the-court brief, as will the Bazelon Center for Mental
Health Law in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   New York City officials had no immediate comment on the suit.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 182; Dow Up 130  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied Thursday as investors took heart
in the latest signs that rising interest rates are successfully
keeping inflation at bay. Buyers dipped into the technology sector,
snapping up shares of market leaders that have been battered in the
past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A full slate of benign economic reports provided the spark for
the gains amid hopes that growth will cool to a more sustainable,
less inflationary pace. But with the government's jobless report on
deck for Friday morning, analysts were recommending that investors
remain cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have some indication that the economy is slowing,''
said Gary Campbell, chief investment officer at The Commerce Funds
in St. Louis. ''But it's a little too soon to pop the cork on the
champagne bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 181.59 to close at 3,582.50 and
the Dow Jones industrial average gained 129.87 to close at
10,652.20.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 28.21 to 1,448.81.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after several economic reports suggested that the
pace of the nation's economic growth has slowed a bit. On Thursday
morning, many of the nation's retailers reported lackluster sales
for May, indicating that six interest-rate increases by the Federal
Reserve are beginning to quell consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the National Association of Purchasing Management issued
a report that growth in the industrial economy slowed during May.
The report also said inflationary pressures for industrial supplies
appeared to have peaked in March.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Commerce Department said spending on
construction projects fell 0.6 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of moderating growth could persuade the Fed to raise
interest rates by a slim quarter-percentage point -- or perhaps to
hold them steady -- at its next meeting on June 27-28, said Michael
Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an end to the Fed's long run of rate increases
helped financial stocks Thursday. Merrill Lynch rose $5.125 to $104
and PNC Financial rose $3.375 to $53.563.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology sector made the steepest gains, continuing a
tentative recovery from a long, steep decline in March and April
that knocked the Nasdaq more than 37 percent below its March 10
record. At the close Thursday, it was still off 29 percent from the
record 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those stocks reached an oversold level and deserved to bounce
back,'' Campbell said. ''There's no question that there's a strong
fundamental story here, although many of these stocks remain very
expensive relative to earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco rose $4 to $60.938 and PMC-Sierra rose $16.75 to $170.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard soared $14.375 to $134.50 following upbeat
projections made at the company's semiannual meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $2 to $64.563. The company has asked for extra
time to formulate a breakup plan should a federal judge order the
company to divest its Windows operating systems business.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise development Thursday, the judge granted a Justice
Department request for more time to explore possible areas of
agreement on secondary issues. But the government would continue
its drive to break up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Rick Sherlund said the stock may be
able to recover some ''lost ground'' after the judge rules and the
lengthy appeal process gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 'quiet time' in which there is not much new news on the
lawsuit could enable sentiment to improve a bit,'' Sherlund told
clients. Sherlund, among Wall Street's most influential Microsoft
analysts, has triggered several shifts in the stock's performance
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders spent the session looking ahead to the Labor
Department's May employment report, due out before the start of
trading Friday. Any signs of slower growth -- whether in a higher
unemployment rate or lower wage pressures -- should enable the
market to extend its efforts to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has viewed the plummeting jobless rate as a sign that
companies would have to sharply raise wages and benefits to retain
workers. That could eventually force them to raise prices, setting
a stage for renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve
Bank, said Thursday in Salt Lake City that central bankers were
viewing the reports with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think one ought to be very careful in basing a forecast on a
handful of indicators,'' said Parry, who has a vote this year on
setting interest rates. ''Indicators do get revised.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.15
billion shares, compared with 1.14 billion on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 16.29 to
492.47.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market drew strength from overseas markets, which were
almost uniformly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.2
percent. Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.3 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 gained 1.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.7
percent.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Mourns Tito Puente  </HEADLINE>
By JESUS VERA IRIZARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico embraced Ernesto
''Tito'' Puente as a native son, and on word Thursday of his death,
the Caribbean island's government declared three official days of
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts all of us,'' said Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto
Rico's lone delegate to the U.S. Congress. ''He put Puerto Rico's
name in lights.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Puente, who had recently been treated for a
heart ailment, died Wednesday at age 77. While remembrances came in
from the world over, many artists in this U.S. commonwealth who
worked with Puente over the decades were stunned at his passing.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic artist Nestor Otero said Puente gave Puerto Ricans in
the mainland United States and around the world a sense of
belonging to a single community. Puente ''incorporated our music in
the international vocabulary,'' Otero said.
</P>
<P>
   Otero said that watching Puente play at New York's Palladium or
the old Huntspoint Palace was like seeing Puerto Rican actor Jose
Ferrer on film and exclaiming, ''Wow, he's a Puerto Rican just like
we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente's triumphs were Puerto Rico's; each time he won a Grammy
-- five in all -- this island of 4 million celebrated. Over the
years, he nurtured an adoring following among Puerto Ricans, Cubans
and others who basked in his U.S. success.
</P>
<P>
   As an arranger, Puente ''was the best in Afro-Antilles music,''
said longtime Puerto Rican radio personality Mariano Artau, who
hosted Puente decades ago on his local midday show.
</P>
<P>
   Angel ''Lito'' Pena, one of the island's leading composers and
arrangers, said Puente had an uncanny ability to communicate his
exuberant musical vision -- and because of that became the crossover
star in the United States who opened doors for later generations of
Latin musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was an innovator whom everyone wanted to imitate because
God had chosen him to fulfill a mission,'' Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   Puente's brand of Latin jazz was influenced by traditional
harmonies in the United States without abandoning the rhythmic
roots of Puerto Rico, said Pena, founder of the Pan American
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Puente appeared a little tired during his last performance in
Puerto Rico earlier this year, said Dennis Rodriguez, a conga
player and longtime friend of Puente. But Rodriguez said he
preferred the memories of an exhilarated Puente rocking the walls
of Brooklyn's St. George Hotel in the 1970s -- and noted that
Puente, despite his health, had no thoughts of retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He died with his boots on, valiantly, knowing that the best
way to leave this world was to do what he was doing,'' Rodriguez
said.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Ban Insecticide For Home Use  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the most commonly used insecticides
around homes and gardens will be banned for household use, sources
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In line with a 1996 law that lowered the acceptable exposure
limits for such chemicals, the Environmental Protection Agency
concluded that chlorpyrifos, sold under the trade names Dursban and
Lorsban, can no longer be safely used where children are exposed to
the residue, said an official familiar with the agency's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers probably won't be allowed to spray apple trees and grape
vines after they bloom, but other agricultural applications will
continue without new restrictions, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is to announce its decision June 8.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical is most heavily used on corn and other crops, but
it's also been used for years indoors and outside to kill termites,
roaches, ants, fleas and other pests. Some 20 to 24 million pounds
of the chemical are applied annually nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The ban targets applications around the home because they
represent a more direct and therefore higher level of exposure, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical's maker, Dow AgroSciences of Indianapolis, said in
a statement that it stands behind the product's safety but that
''the additional restrictions that the agency will require will be
manageable'' for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical is used on 75 percent of the nation's apple crop,
so EPA's decision will force growers to switch to alternative
pesticides. With the new restriction, ''the dietary risk issue is
well under control,'' said Allen Jennings, who manages pesticide
policy for the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction on the chemical's use with grapes is unlikely to
have much impact because chlorpyrifos is generally applied when the
vines are dormant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An EPA spokeswoman did not return telephone calls Thursday. The
Washington Post first reported on the agency's plans in its
Thursday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is to release new estimates of the chemical's
hazards, based on experiments showing the substance can cause brain
damage in fetal rats. The agency concluded the compound poses no
immediate threat to public health and won't order a recall of
products containing it.
</P>
<P>
   EPA is acting under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, which
requires it to reassess tolerance levels -- margins of safety -- for
hundreds of pesticides. Normally, the EPA sets the limit at
one-one-hundredth of the level at which there are no detectable
effects on an animal. Under the 1996 law, that level must be 10
times lower if children are exposed to the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the agency banned the use of methyl parathion on all
fruit and many vegetables and restricted the use of
azinphos-methyl. Like Dursban, those pesticides belong to a class
of chemicals called organophosphates, which include nerve agents
developed as chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Food Quality Protection Act has fundamentally changed the
way in which pesticides are regulated in the U.S.,'' Dow's
statement said. ''The rules have changed, but the safety of
chlorpyrifos products hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have been pushing EPA to ban home use of
Dursban and restrict its use on fruit. ''Any of the home uses,
professional or homeowner applied, those are the biggest risk to
kids,'' said Richard Wiles, a researcher with the Environmental
Working Group, an advocacy organization.

<HEADLINE> Senator: Ambassador Nominees Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Rod Grams said Thursday that six nominees
for ambassadorial posts have been charged with security violations
during their careers in the foreign service.
</P>
<P>
   Grams, R-Minn, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which must pass judgment on the nominees as part of
their confirmation process. He did not name the six but said they
collectively had committed 62 violations and that one appointee was
responsible for 22.
</P>
<P>
   Grams outlined his concerns in a letter to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   He said rewarding diplomats charged with security violations
appears to run counter to the standard Albright set a month ago
when she spoke to a meeting of State Department employees
</P>
<P>
   Albright told the gathering, ''I don't care how skilled you are
as a diplomat, how brilliant you may be at meetings, or how
creative you are as an administrator; if you are not professional
about security, you are a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Grams said in his letter that it would help the committee as the
nominations are processed if Albright would reconcile her statement
with the fact that the president has chosen ''to reward individuals
whom you describe as 'failures' with high honors and the
responsibility of representing the United States and her interests
in foreign countries.''

<HEADLINE> Executive admits funneling donations to Torricelli campaign  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Bergen County-based executive of a South
Korean conglomerate admitted Thursday that he illegally funneled
$20,000 in donations to U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli's 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cha-Kuek ''Charles'' Koo admitted he recruited eight ''straw''
donors at the behest of another businessman, David Chang, so their
enterprises might prosper if Torricelli was elected. Chang gave him
cash to reimburse the donors, Koo said.
</P>
<P>
   Koo is the fifth person to admit wrongdoing regarding the New
Jersey Democrat's fund-raising and has agreed to cooperate with the
Justice Department's Campaign Financing Task Force. The task force
has charged a total of 25 people regarding abuses in the 1996
elections.
</P>
<P>
   He could testify against Chang, who is accused of directing
$23,000 in illegal donations -- separate from the $20,000 -- to the
Torricelli campaign. Chang and his former aide, Audrey Yu, are to
go on trial here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, 54, of Alpine, a South Korean citizen, is president of LG
Group's executive office for the Americas in Englewood Cliffs. The
LG Group is one of South Korea's largest conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli is not accused of any wrongdoing. He has maintained
he was unaware of the improper donations, which have since been
donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli lawyer Abbe David Lowell released a statement
asserting that the ''Justice Department has confirmed that neither
the senator nor anyone in the campaign are the focus of any
investigation and not one of the people who have admitted making
these improper contributions has even hinted that anyone in the
campaign knew what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the campaign task force, Robert J. Conrad, declined
to comment on whether Torricelli was aware of straw donations.
Conrad attended Koo's plea.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli has described Chang as a friend. As for Koo, ''They
met many years ago, but they haven't had any contact for quite some
time,'' Torricelli spokesman Richard McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's fund-raising ability led to his appointment as
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. While a
congressman from Bergen County, he raised $9.2 million to defeat
Rep. Richard A. Zimmer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Koo and his lawyer did not speak to reporters after Koo pleaded
guilty to a single misdemeanor charge of making campaign
contributions in the name of another person.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plea bargain, Koo agreed to waive the three-year
statute of limitations on the offense in return for no further
prosecution regarding the $20,000 or Koo's efforts to obstruct the
investigation into the ''conduit'' contributions, according to
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Such donations are structured to evade the limit on federal
campaigns -- $1,000 a candidate from a single donor for each
election -- often by illegally reimbursing the person who supposedly
made the contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Koo faces up to six months in prison, and has a chance of
getting probation, when sentenced Sept. 7 by U.S. District Judge
Alfred M. Wolin.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning in court by Wolin, Koo acknowledged that in
late 1995 Chang's companies owed LG Group more than $50 million
used by Chang to finance the shipment of goods to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea had failed to pay Chang's companies in full, so
Chang was unable to repay LG Group, Koo said.
</P>
<P>
   Chang operated several international trading companies based in
Englewood Cliffs, including Bright &AMP; Bright, Nikko Enterprises Inc.
and Panacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wolin asked if Koo agreed to make illegal contributions with
Chang ''in the hope that if Senator Torricelli were elected he
would help David Chang's companies, and therefore LG Group, recover
money he lost in trading with North Korea?''
</P>
<P>
   Koo responded yes.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting at an Englewood Cliffs diner in December 1995,
Chang asked Koo to help raise funds for Torricelli's campaign, Koo
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Koo said he could not contribute because he was not a U.S.
citizen, Chang asked him to solicit employees at LG Group and
others who were citizens, Koo said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Chang sought the maximum from the primary and general
elections -- $4,000 from a married couple, $2,000 from an individual
-- and said he would reimburse checks solicited by Koo.
</P>
<P>
   Koo obtained checks from eight people, including seven
subordinates at LG Group, and brought them to a Torricelli
fund-raiser in mid-December 1995 at the Fort Lee Hilton that Chang
attended, Koo said.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, of Cresskill, later gave Koo $20,000 in cash, of which
Koo used $18,000 to reimburse seven of the donors, Koo said. Koo
kept the remainder as compensation for forgiving an unrelated
$2,000 debt from the eighth donor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reimbursing the conduit donors, Koo warned them to be
quiet about the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have pleaded guilty in connection with
Torricelli fund-raising is Berek Paul Don, a former Bergen County
Republican leader. Despite his GOP affiliation, he admitted
illegally donating $11,000 from a Chang company through other
employees in his law office, and said that Chang asked him to get
the money into the Torricelli campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is accused of using the $11,000 to reimburse the straw
donors, and of reimbursing $10,000 in other donations.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Refugees Stay in Camp  </HEADLINE>
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- About 80 former Vietnamese boat people on
Thursday demanded government housing and subsidies after they were
made homeless by the closure of Hong Kong's last refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were among 136 people who defied orders to move
out of their rent-free barracks at remote Pillar Point after the
camp's official closure at midnight Wednesday. The closure ended
Hong Kong's 25 years of providing temporary asylum to the
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government wants to kick us out but doesn't give us a
place to live,'' said Fan Chun-keung, 34, at the daylong sit-in at
government headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not criminals. We're just an unfortunate bunch that got
stuck here,'' the part-time construction worker said.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Ip, Hong Kong's security secretary, said only those who
have signed an agreement to move out soon are allowed to stay at
the camp temporarily. They still have to register with security
officials before entering and leaving the locked camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied that they were kept behind a locked gate, a few of
the remaining residents scuffled with police and security officials
early Thursday, Asia Television reported. There were no arrests or
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The government decided in February to shut down the camp and
give the refugees Hong Kong residency, calling it a humanitarian
solution for the Vietnamese and their Hong Kong-born children who
had been awaiting relocation to the West -- some for up to two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,274 have applied for residency; 143 have not.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees must now find their own means to survive in the
affluent society, where rent for even the tiniest apartments in
urban areas is frequently exceeds $750 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees are unemployed or work odd jobs and complain that
employers are reluctant to hire foreign workers. Others say they
cannot find landlords who will rent to them.
</P>
<P>
   Lam Li-lna, 35, said her monthly salary of $640 can barely
support her unemployed husband and daughter, 2, even with free
housing.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one would rent us a place because I couldn't prove to the
landlords that I could pay rent for more than two months,'' said
Lam, who fled Vietnam on a ramshackle fishing boat in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million Vietnamese fled to neighboring countries on foot
or by boat to escape poverty or persecution after the communist
North defeated the U.S.-backed South in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, then a British colony, gave unconditional temporary
asylum to people awaiting resettlement in the West until 1988, when
it added a screening process to separate political and economic
refugees. The latter were sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees were stuck in Hong Kong because they were refused
asylum elsewhere because of criminal records or drug problems.
Others had nowhere to go because the government could not prove
their identity.

<HEADLINE> British Balloonist Misses North Pole  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British adventurer fell agonizingly short of
becoming the first person to fly over the North Pole in a balloon --
but had the consolation of being able to claim a first by making it
over the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   David Hempelman-Adams, 44, was told by his flight controllers
early Thursday to abort his mission just 13 miles short of the Pole
because of strong winds -- and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   He lifted off on Sunday from Longyearbyen, the main town on
Norway's Svalbard islands, for a 600-mile solo flight in a
80-foot-tall helium balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Hempleman-Adams, speaking by satellite phone, said he had two
things on his mind after having had just four hours sleep in four
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need to get my head down (and) I'm really looking forward to
a cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to fly in a balloon from the Svalbard islands
to the North Pole, in 1897, ended in tragedy for a Swedish
expedition when the three flyers crashed and later died after
spending three months on the ice.

<HEADLINE> State seeks more time to clean air, eliminate auto inspection waits </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EWING TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- Long lines at New Jersey auto
emissions testing stations continue to dog state officials.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, state authorities Thursday asked the federal
Environmental Protection Agency to give them another month to
shorten motorists' waiting time before completely changing over to
the enhanced testing system.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokeswoman Mary Mears said Thursday the agency was likely
to agree to push the state's deadline back from the end of June to
the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   State Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein said the state
will do all it can to diminish long lines at select testing
stations to allow the new system to be installed at all sites.
</P>
<P>
   The state will continue to use the old system at seven stations
through the end of July, Weinstein said. To ease waits at those
stations once the enhanced system is finally installed there, the
state will take appointments and extend hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, motorists who pass the old test will receive a
one-year sticker. Those who pass the enhanced test offered at other
stations will receive a two-year sticker, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That change is a result of an agreement entered into by the
state and the New Jersey Gasoline Retailers Association. Thursday
was the state's deadline to implement the enhanced system statewide
under a lawsuit brought by the gas stations, who complain they are
unable to compete with state inspection stations that offer the old
test.
</P>
<P>
   If the state had abided by the agreement with the gas retailers
and implemented the enhanced system statewide Thursday, only 11 of
the state's 32 stations would have complied with contracted waiting
times under the deal with Parsons Infrastructure and Technology
Group, the company building and installing the new system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If waiting times are still excessive after Aug. 1, the state may
consider changing the inspection period for motorists from one
month to one or two weeks, Weinstein said. Theoretically, that
would prevent most motorists from crowding inspection stations at
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Taking appointments ''is a wise and smart way to deal with an
issue that would result in outrageous wait times if we did not make
this move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state needs the extra time from the EPA to hire and train
additional workers to set up the appointment schedule at the
beleaguered stations, which are located in the state's southern and
northwestern sections, Weinstein explained.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said remaining delays are not nearly as bad as those
that greeted motorists last December, when Parsons inaugurated the
enhanced auto emissions system statewide. Parsons now can inspect
an average of about 12 cars per hour statewide, compared to only
about six per hour in December, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials were forced to partially shelve the new system
last winter after it was snowed under with frozen or malfunctioning
computer equipment. Under its state contract, Parsons has been
fined more than $1 million for excessive waiting times since then,
Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the appointment schedules and other improvements, the
state still projects some sporadic long waits after Aug. 1, but at
least it should be in compliance with EPA's clean air standards,
the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic critics of the Whitman Administration said
Thursday that Weinstein's plan does not go far enough to alleviate
waits for motorists or lost business for private garages who offer
the enhanced test.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Whitman people keep writing checks to pay Parsons, but
taxpayers get nothing but double talk and endless delays,'' said
Sen. Garry J. Furnari, D-Essex.

<HEADLINE> Deacon who heard murder confession was also a state trooper  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Two days after a fatal shotgun shooting
outside a Newark fast food restaurant, David Cary sought spiritual
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Cary wanted to turn himself in, and went to his Baptist pastor
for help.
</P>
<P>
   For help, the pastor looked to a deacon in the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The three men prayed, talked and then the deacon read Cary his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The deacon's day job: State Police trooper.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Cary wouldn't talk to Newark police and later
argued before a trial court judge that his confession should be
kept from a jury.
</P>
<P>
   But after some initial hesitation, trooper John Perry relayed
details of Cary's confession.
</P>
<P>
   However, the judge agreed with the defense and ordered the
confession suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court Thursday disagreed and said when Cary
confessed he told his tale to a police officer, not a cleric.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the fact that Cary knew Perry was a state trooper and
that Perry warned Cary of his right to remain silent and searched
Cary, it is difficult to comprehend how Cary could have 'reasonably
expected' that his communication with Perry would remain
confidential,'' Judge Steven L. Lefelt wrote in the unanimous
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ordered the trial court to continue with its
proceedings and allow Perry to give his version of Cary's
statements. Cary is charged with murder for firing gunshots into
the restaurant on Feb. 5, 1999, and striking Andre Dean. Dean later
died from the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in the court's 15-page decision, the judges
wrangled with the meaning of cleric, as defined in state law and in
Baptist orders.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's 1947 state constitution recognizes the
''cleric-penitent privilege'', but that only applies in
''confessions to clergymen and ministers,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Cary went to the Second Baptist
Church in Bellville on Feb. 7, 1999, to speak to Pastor Lucious
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Cary waited through the Sunday service and then met with
Williams. But before meeting with Cary, Williams talked to Perry,
telling the officer that the suspect came ''to turn himself in,
because he got in trouble with the law,'' the decision reads.
</P>
<P>
   Williams later testified that Perry's role as an ordained deacon
made him a church official with duties and responsibilities similar
to that of a pastor.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said it was clear Perry was not acting as a deacon
when he put Cary up against a wall, searched him and read him a
Miranda warning before calling local police.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Introduce Lewis Statement  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Police officers testified Thursday that Baltimore
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis gave them a statement full of lies and
contradictions when they interviewed him hours after a brawl that
left two men dead.
</P>
<P>
   The statement shows Lewis denied knowing many of the people who
rode in his rented limousine and gave inconsistent accounts of
whether anyone in his party was cut during the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and two friends, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, are
on trial for murder in the deaths of Jacinth Baker and Richard
Lollar, who were stabbed in the Jan. 31 fight after a Super Bowl
party.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial began, Lewis' lawyers tried to keep his
statement out of evidence. But Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner
ordered that it be admitted because she said it was ''freely and
voluntarily given.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was at a friend's house in Norcross on the morning
after the killing, refused to go to the police station but agreed
to give a written statement to Atlanta police Lt. M.C. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''On my way to my limousine ... a fight broke out way up past my
limousine,'' Lewis' statement said. ''We saw it, I grabbed my
people, we hopped in my truck, we left. While we're driving off, we
heard gun shots. We left the scene, and that is basically it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis at first denied knowing the names of the people in the
limousine, calling them ''just club people.'' But later in the
statement he identified a woman named Jaye and someone named A.J.
Johnson, an alias used by Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied knowing about someone's head being cut, but later
told Smith that Johnson ''had his head busted.'' Earlier testimony
showed that Oakley's head was cut with a champagne bottle during
the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis refused to sign the statement and told officers he had to
leave to catch a flight to Hawaii, where he was playing in the Pro
Bowl. He promised to answer more questions when he returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you understand that two people died last night and you can
help identify the suspects?'' Smith asked Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys had argued that officers coerced the statement
by threatening to destroy Lewis' football career if he didn't
cooperate. They also noted that Smith used a racial stereotype
during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I said was, 'All African-Americans have nicknames,'''
Smith said. ''I regret that I gave anything that can be
misconstrued or misinterpreted, and I apologize for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he made the statement while talking to Tony Williams,
a family friend of Lewis. He said he was trying to find out the
real names of men called Shorty, Derby, Fedora and A.J. Prosecutors
have said the remark is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is composed of 10 blacks and two whites. All the
defendants and the victims are black.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the seventh day of testimony. The prosecution,
which had hoped to finish Friday, now says it will take until at
least Monday to wrap up its case.
</P>
<P>
   The state still has to call forensics experts, medical examiners
and a few more police officers. Prosecutors also may call some of
the other people in Lewis' limousine, including two men only known
as Gino and Claudus.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said Thursday he has
not heard whether limousine driver Duane Fassett will return to
testify. Howard wants him back to probe inconsistencies between the
statement Fassett gave police and what he said on the stand last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The judge issued another subpoena for Fassett earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   When the prosecution finishes, the defense will ask the judge to
make a directed verdict of not guilty for Lewis, which would
dismiss his case without having to go to a jury, said Ed Garland,
Lewis' attorney.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Name Sidney Lowe As Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies hired
Sidney Lowe as head coach and Andy Dolich as president of business
operations, two moves the franchise hope will turn around losing
ways on the court and at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, a former head coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves, and
Dolich, vice-president of Tickets.com, North America's
second-largest ticketing organization, were introduced at a news
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both were given multiyear contracts as the franchise's revamping
continues under Chicago businessman Michael Heisley, who bought the
team earlier this year for $160 million. He hired Dick Versace as
team president and Billy Knight as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies were 22-60 last season, losing $25 million as
average attendance slid to 13,000 from 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, 40, had a brief stint as Minnesota's head coach six years
ago, going 33-102. He then spent five seasons as an assistant with
the Cleveland Cavaliers under Mike Fratello before returning to
Minnesota as an assistant last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously they weren't good times during those years in
Minnesota, but I gained some valuable experience there,'' Lowe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Versace shrugged off Lowe's difficult first experience as an NBA
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get fired in this league, that's like a boy scout
getting a badge of honor,'' he said. ''I was interested in
substance, not style.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe played on North Carolina State's 1983 national championship
team and for five teams in the NBA. He was the consensus choice
after a 10-hour interview at Heisley's Chicago office, Versace
said.
</P>
<P>
   Versace said several coaches were on Vancouver's list of
candidates, including former Atlanta Hawks head coach Lenny
Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just felt the right guy for this team should be someone
who's coming in breathing fire,'' Versace said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe characterized the Grizzlies as a younger version of the
Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a couple of pieces, some excellent pieces that we
can match up against any players in the league,'' he said. ''It's
my job to maximize those guys' talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies star forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim had hinted through
agent Aaron Goodwin he might want out of Vancouver, but Goodwin
said he couldn't comment on Lowe's appointment because he didn't
know him.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich's pro sports experience includes baseball, hockey, soccer
and box lacrosse. His last NBA stint was a brief period as
president of the Golden State Warriors in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich said Vancouver's problems are nothing compared to what he
faced turning around baseball's Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 14 years we were one of baseball's most significant
ugly-duckling-to-swan stories,'' said Dolich, whose marketing savvy
helped boost season-ticket sales to 14,000 from 400.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recipe for improvement is pretty simple,'' he said. ''You
have an exciting and improving product on the court, knowledgeable
management committed to a realistic game plan (and) ownership with
a strong spine, a big heart and a flexible purse.''

<HEADLINE> McGann, Park Lead LPGA K. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURRELLS INLET, S.C. (AP) -- Michelle McGann and rookie Grace
Park shot 6-under-par 66s on Thursday to share the first-round lead
in the Kathy Ireland Greens.com Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's Jenny Lidback was a stroke back and Cristie Kerr and
England's Karen Stupples opened with 68s in the LPGA Tour event
that resembles the PGA Tour's ''Dead Zone'' of starless tournaments
following the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   With the LPGA Tour's second major, the LPGA Championship,
scheduled in three weeks, several of the sport's biggest names
skipped the $750,000 event at Wachesaw Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Australian star Karrie Webb, a four-time winner this year, is
fishing during a two-week vacation at her Florida home that ends
next week. Sweden's Anika Sorenstam and England's Laura Davies,
both two-time winners, are in Sweden for the Chrysler Open.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Etzel, vice president of business development for first-time
sponsor Greens.com, says the players have difficult choices to make
in their 35-week schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tiger Woods only plays 17 or 18 events a year on the PGA,''
Etzel said. ''We hope we can do some little things to make it more
attractive to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene stealer so far this week has been Ireland, the
calendar girl who has spun through South Carolina promoting her
golf apparel line, her tournament, her distaste for the Confederate
flag and her love for golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to show my daughter (18-month-old Lily) that
there are role models for her out there,'' Ireland said of her LPGA
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   But McGann, seeking her first victory since 1997, doesn't
believe she's contending in a ''Who's that?'' event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all have different fans, people were driving in from
Raleigh to see me,'' said McGann, known for her flowery,
large-brimmed hats. ''We really can't control that. I feel our tour
has a lot of strong players that people want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Park is quickly becoming one of them. Only weeks ago, the
21-year-old former Arizona State star had missed four cuts in her
previous six tournaments and was questioning everything about her
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''My confidence was way down. It had never been that low,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But as quickly as it took for a sweetly struck 3-wood off the
15th tee in the first round of last week's LPGA Corning Classic to
land long and straight in the fairway, Park was back on target.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shot was so good, so pure,'' she said. ''Last week, for
the first time all year, I hit the ball really well and had a lot
of birdie opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, leading the tour's rookie standings, carried that into
tight, tricky Wachesaw. She had a tap-in birdie on the par-5 10th
and rolled in an 8-footer for birdie two holes later. Park moved
within a stroke of McGann with another 8-foot birdie putt on the
16th and caught her by floating a 25-yard bunker shot into the cup
at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great finish, a great feeling to make that shot,'' said
Park, who jammed her left arm in the air after the shot went in.
''Sometimes, you just get lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   McGann didn't need luck, just a quick round in the increasing
Southern temperatures -- she is a diabetic who uses an insulin pump
while playing and must check her blood sugar several times a round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good,'' said McGann, who tied for third three weeks ago
in Nashville, Tenn. ''My health is good and I am going to have to
eat a little more tomorrow with playing in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   McGann, who started on the 10th tee, made birdies putts from 10
feet or less on Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 7. She got to 6 under with a
15-foot put for birdie on the par-3 8th.
</P>
<P>
   Lidback was 6 under through 14 holes, but three-putted the par-5
17th to fall back.

<HEADLINE> Investment Fraud Charges Levied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 28-state sweep by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and state securities regulators has led to over
a dozen enforcement actions involving the fraudulent sale of
promissory notes.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Thursday that the enforcement action, meant to
combat this practice, resulted in charges against hundreds of
individuals and businesses, who allegedly defrauded more than 3,000
investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep took place over the past several weeks and culminated
in Thursday's announcement, said North American Securities
Administrators Association spokesman Myles Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Promissory notes typically involve loans to companies made by
investors in exchange for a fixed amount of periodic income.
However, ''legitimate corporate promissory notes are not usually
sold to the general public,'' said Susan Wyderko, director of the
SEC Office of Investor Education and Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone calls you up or knocks on your door trying to sell
you a promissory note, chances are you're dealing with a scam,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraudulent notes, the SEC said, targeted elderly investors,
falsely claimed the money invested was guaranteed by insurance
companies or collateral located offshore, and promised unusually
high returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors must never forget the first rule of finance: the
greater the reward, the greater the risk,'' said NASAA President
Brad Skolnick. ''In today's market, there's no such thing as a
'guaranteed' 10 percent or 15 percent return.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case in Illinois, four persons and their companies are
accused of raising $114 million from hundreds of investors by
selling promissory notes in a $314 million Ponzi scheme. Other
schemes raised from $4 million to $63 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC advises potential investors to see if the investment is
registered with the SEC or their state. The SEC also reminded that
insurance agents cannot sell securities without a securities
license, and investors should make sure the seller dealing with
them is properly licensed.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC and the states undertook the sweep because fraudulent
notes have become a growing problem for regulators, Edwards said.
He said the investigations will continue.

<HEADLINE> Killer's life spared: Judge rejects death penalty request  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A judge Thursday agreed to spare the
life of an Ocean County man who stabbed a thrift shop owner to
death during a robbery, citing the man's troubled childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Derek LeCompte, 20, faces 30 years to life in prison for the
1999 slaying of Linda Thomas, owner of The Garage Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, absolutely nothing could justify what he did. But
it is explained because of his disruptive home life. That is where
we develop love and a moral sense of responsibility,'' said
Superior Court Judge Edward J. Turnbach.
</P>
<P>
   LeCompte, who witnessed alcoholism and domestic violence while
growing up in his mother's home, was turned out by his mother and
then his father and lived in a broken-down car for a period before
he dropped out of Toms River North High School during his senior
year, according to testimony this week.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted stabbing Thomas 42 times during a May 4, 1999,
robbery that netted about $375 and some used stereo equipment. The
killing was captured on a surveillance camera videotape, but the
tape has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Assistant Ocean County Prosecutor John J. Mercun had
urged Turnbach to sentence LeCompte to death.
</P>
<P>
   But Turnbach would not, saying the mitigating factors -- as
presented by LeCompte's lawyers -- outweighed the aggravating
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Thomas, 37, the victim's husband, was satisfied with
Turnbach's finding nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ''It helps the spirit of Linda rest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At his July 7 sentencing, LeCompte faces 30 years to life in
prison. As calculated by the state Department of Corrections, a
life term is 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   LeCompte would have to serve 85 percent of that, or 63 years and
nine months, before becoming eligible for parole. Mercun said
Thursday he would seek the maximum.

<HEADLINE> Sources: Thorn Considering Nets Job  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J (AP) -- Rod Thorn, the NBA's head of
basketball operations and the man who drafted Michael Jordan, is
considering joining the New Jersey Nets as president and chief of
basketball operations, sources told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread around the league Thursday that Thorn had accepted
the job, although he did not return calls seeking comment. NBA and
Nets officials also refused to comment, although a general manager
from another Eastern Conference team said Thorn was ready to take
the job.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the league told The Associated Press that
Thorn would be leaving the NBA within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets tried to hire Thorn as president of basketball
operations in the latter part of last year. The talks started in
August and they culminated last October with Thorn accepting a
five-year, $7 million contract, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, Thorn backed out of the deal and decided to stay
with the NBA, the source said. He was promoted from senior vice
president to executive vice president of basketball operations and
his salary was doubled to about $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn was an assistant coach with the Nets in their ABA glory
days in the 1970s, then moved to the Chicago Bulls as general
manager before joining the league office.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the Nets' job, Thorn would be asked to turn around a
woeful franchise that has missed the playoffs the last two years,
and only made it 10 times since joining the NBA in 1976-77. It has
also had 10 seasons of 50-plus losses since the merger with the
defunct ABA.
</P>
<P>
   There would be pluses though. The Nets have two of the game's
finest young players in point guard Stephon Marbury and forward
Keith Van Horn and also own the rights to the first pick overall in
the NBA draft later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn would also get to pick the team's new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey was fired a week after the Nets (31-51) finished the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   That was the start of a franchise facelift. President Michael
Rowe, who had run the team since October 1995, resigned a week
after that and the team also started a search for a director of
basketball operations, a new position.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Nash reportedly will be fired soon.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports in the past week that former Georgetown
coach John Thompson and Pacers general manager David Kahn were
being seriously considered for the job as director of basketball
operations. Michael Jackson, one of Thompson's former players and a
former TNT executive, would become president.
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA, Thorn runs the league's on-court operations,
including scheduling, officiating, game conduct and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn oversaw the NBA's creation of new rules last fall that
were meant to curb physical play and return the league to a more
open-court, high-scoring style of play.

   Thorn joined the NBA in 1986 after a 20-year career as a player,
coach and general manager. He had two stints as a Nets assistant
under Kevin Loughery. The first was between 1973-75 and it included
an ABA title in 1973-74 on a team led by Julius Erving. The second
stint was between 1976-78 and it featured seasons of 60 and 58
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The year between the stints he was the head coach of the Spirits
of the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   A guard at West Virginia, Thorn was the second pick in the 1963
NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets. He later played for Detroit,
St. Louis and Seattle, averaging 10.8 points in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn joined the coaching ranks in 1971 as an assistant to Lenny
Wilkens in Seattle and moved to the Nets in 1973-75. After a year
as coach of the Spirits, he returned for two more seasons in New
Jersey. He left to become the Bulls general manager from 1978
through 1984, when the team drafted Michael Jordan. He coached the
Bulls for 30 games in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Judge hears final summations on fen-phen settlement proposal  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- Opponents of the proposed $3.75 billion fen-phen
settlement vowed Thursday to appeal if the deal is not rejected by
a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Edward F. Blizzard, who represents a group of users who
object to the settlement, made one final plea to U.S. District
Court Judge Louis C. Bechtle to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we allow this to go forward, there will be a substantial
risk it will be reversed and we will have wasted time'' that could
have been better spent attending to users' health needs, Blizzard
said during his final summation.
</P>
<P>
   After the session, Blizzard promised he would appeal to the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals if Bechtle gives his approval.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home
Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet
drug combination. The Madison, N.J.-based company sold the
combination under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a
chemical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic
study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. The
second drug in the combination, phentermine, was not linked to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, fen-phen users would get a maximum of $1.5
million, though most would get far less, depending on their level
of injury and how long they took the drugs. The settlement also
includes money for their future medical monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Bechtle gave preliminary approval to the deal last November and
is expected to decide sometime this summer whether it will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say monetary damages are insufficient, the settlement
does not include compensation for people who may develop health
problems later and users had inadequate representation.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not yet fully understand the health effects of
fen-phen, Blizzard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, the headlights might not be able to capture
what is out there. The science has not been completed yet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for American Home and plaintiffs' counsel disputed
that, pointing out that 16 major studies were performed to
determine the effects of Pondimin and Redux. The studies found that
any ill effects of the drug generally show up right away, said
plaintiffs' attorney Michael D. Fishbein.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market, about 45,000 have refused the settlement and retain the
right to sue for punitive damages. Another 266,000 have registered
to join the class. Those people may still reject the settlement and
sue for compensatory damages but are forbidden from collecting
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been an overwhelming vote for approval of the terms
of the settlement,'' Fishbein said.

<HEADLINE> Griffey: Rose Should Be at Reunion  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. thinks that major league
baseball is wrong to stop Pete Rose from attending a weekend
celebration of the Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who accepted a lifetime ban for gambling in 1989, isn't
allowed to participate in a weekend reunion of the Cincinnati Reds'
1975 World Series championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball made an exception last year and allowed Rose to go on
the field as part of its All-Century team introduced at the World
Series. But baseball declined to make exceptions for anniversary
commemorations this season of Rose's championship team in
Cincinnati and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said before Thursday night's game against Montreal that
Rose should be part of the festivities because he was part of the
'75 team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't care less whether you ban him from the game, but
certain things are important not only to him but to the guys he
played with,'' Griffey said. ''He should be allowed to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ''You banned him from the game; you didn't ban him from
(honoring) things that other people have done. People want to see
him, too. Everybody knows that something's missing and it shouldn't
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of his ban, Rose cannot go on the field or do
anything other than be an ordinary fan. He applied for
reinstatement in September 1997, but commissioner Bud Selig has
said repeatedly that nothing has happened in the last 11 years to
change baseball's position.
</P>
<P>
   Former commissioner Bart Giamatti concluded that Rose had bet on
baseball. Rose admitted to betting on sports, but denied betting on
baseball. After seeking help for gambling and admitting he had a
problem, Rose later resumed placing bets and denying he had a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's father, Ken Sr., played with Rose on the Big Red
Machine. Griffey Jr. said Rose should be allowed to make
appearances for special occasions, such as when the Reds retired
Tony Perez's No. 24 last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ask any guy, 'Would you want him there for the
celebration? (They'd say) yeah,''' Griffey Jr. said. ''They're
honoring someone else, they're not honoring Pete Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior raised the subject while talking to reporters in the
clubhouse during batting practice. For the first time this season,
he was not in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   A day after manager Jack McKeon said he had no plans to rest
Griffey, he changed his mind and gave him a day off. Griffey was
hitless in his last 14 at-bats, dropping his average to .212. He
leads the club with 14 homers and 38 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought about McKeon's decision, Griffey said,
''Does it really matter what I think?''
</P>
<P>
   He played cards with teammates, read a newspaper and later
fiddled with one of his bats at his dressing cubicle while the rest
of the team headed for the field.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who played in 161 and 160 games each of the last two
seasons, wished he were in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't come to work to sit down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon figured that with interleague play set to begin Friday
and the Expos starting Javier Vazquez, it was a good time to give
Griffey a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got three American League clubs back-to-back, so he
ought to know them pretty well,'' McKeon said. ''He hasn't faced
this guy tonight, plus (Michael) Tucker's swinging a pretty good
bat right now, so let's get him in there. I was going to play him
one way or another anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger To Stick With Nike Ball  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is making the switch to the swoosh.
</P>
<P>
   After testing a new ball during competition in Germany and in
the Memorial Tournament, Woods said Thursday he will formally
switch to the Nike Tour Accuracy ball when he plays the U.S. Open
at Pebble Beach in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Woods finished third in the Deutsche Bank Open, and then won the
Memorial last week by five strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's done pretty good so far,'' he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement officially ends a marketing conflict between
Woods' top two golf sponsors -- Nike and Titleist -- that began last
year when Nike entered the ball market.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist argued that Nike was using Woods to promote golf balls
because of two commercials -- one that showed Woods bouncing a ball
off his wedge, another that showed hackers on the range belting
300-yard drives as soon as Woods showed up.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Wally Uihlein contemplated a lawsuit, but instead reworked
Woods' deal so that he was paid only when he used Titleist
equipment in tournaments. Titleist also gave up its right to have
its logo on his bag and to use Woods in advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, these were signs and signals suggestive that
different futures were in the cards for both parties,'' Uihlein
said in a statement Thursday. ''Titleist has never been about one
player, but rather a 50-year history of being the most played ball
by more of the best players.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was in Oregon on Thursday for a dedication at Pumpkin
Ridge, where he won his third straight U.S. Amateur, and to attend
a Nike sales meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the conflicts that were inherent in Nike's
introduction of a golf ball,'' Woods said in a statement through
IMG. ''I especially appreciate the way Wally, personally, and
Titleist have handled this in a professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is expected to continue playing Titleist clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He began testing balls earlier this year while at home in
Florida, and he put the Nike ball in play for the first time in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour Accuracy version he played the past two weeks is a
multilayer ball that spins less, something Woods has been working
on the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, it feels different,'' he said last week at the
Memorial. ''Any time you hit a two-piece ball versus a wound ball,
you're going to feel a dramatic difference. But the performance,
the cover, feels very similar to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said the wound ball tended to peak a little more in
flight, while two-piece balls were more likely to be a little more
flat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to fly a little bit different. It will just take
some time getting used to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Woods has officially switched balls could be a boost to
Nike Golf, which only has about 1 percent of the ball market share.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he decides to switch, it's an earthquake,'' Bob Wood,
president of Nike Golf, said when Woods first used the ball in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Nike spokesman Mike Kelly said Woods has not officially signed a
deal to play the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first priority is to get him the product for practice,''
he said. ''At the same time, we'll start and continue our
discussions with IMG on a short-term amendment to the current
contract, and then continue our efforts on a long-term deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has been renegotiating his five-year, $40 million deal
that expires in 2001 since Augusta. Golf World Business reported
that Woods' camp was looking over two proposals from Nike -- one in
which he used the ball.

<HEADLINE> Female prisoners claim male guards allowed to strip-search them  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLEMINGTON, N.J. (AP) -- Some inmates at the state's prison for
women claim they are routinely subject to strip searches by male
guards, even though state policy requires guards of the same sex to
conduct such searches except in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Six current and former inmates have sued the state Department of
Corrections and officials at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility
for Women, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also seeks a court order barring male officers from
conducting or viewing strip searches, as well as from frisking
clothed women without cause.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Department spokesman Christopher Carden said the
agency would not comment on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mahan, which has areas of maximum, medium and minimum security,
has about 1,150 inmates, while less than 30 other female prisoners
are at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 265 guards at Mahan, 110 are female, Carden said. The
prison is in Union Township, Hunterdon County.
</P>
<P>
   The women's prison for years has ''maintained an official policy
and custom of having male corrections officers conduct
non-emergent, suspicionless clothed body searches of female
inmates,'' according to the lawsuit, filed last month in state
Superior Court here.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates were subject to ''overly invasive and harmful''
pat-downs, and were strip-searched after showers, during room
searches and before urine tests, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The state administrative code requires that strip searches and
body cavity searches ''be conducted in a professional and dignified
manner, with maximum courtesy and respect for the inmate's
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No member of the opposite sex shall be present during strip
searches and body cavity searches except medical staff,'' the code
says. An officer of the opposite sex can conduct a strip search
''under emergent conditions as ordered by the superintendent,'' it
says.

<HEADLINE> Attorney: Ex-Wolverine Testifies  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Former Michigan standout and current NBA player
Robert Traylor has testified before a federal grand jury probing a
former Michigan booster's alleged links to illegal gambling, the
player's attorney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishman said Traylor appeared before the grand jurors in
the case of Ed Martin, a retired auto worker who has been a key
figure in a long investigation of possible NCAA rule violations
involving the Wolverines basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman said that as an attorney he was not allowed to hear
Traylor's testimony, given grand jury rules. He declined to
paraphrase what Traylor said during his appearance Wednesday or the
questions posed, saying only ''it has to do with the investigation
of Ed Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't be able to discuss what happened,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor plays for the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Bullock, another former Wolverine represented by Fishman,
has been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury and will
testify perhaps within a month, Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just hasn't had a chance to set up a time yet,'' the
attorney said of Bullock, who was cut by the NBA's Orlando Magic
during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman said Traylor and Bullock have cooperated fully when
interviewed months ago by federal agents investigating Martin, and
that Traylor's testimony Wednesday apparently didn't stray.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have answered all the questions they've been asked.
They've told the truth,'' Fishman said. ''They didn't commit any
crime, didn't do anything by any stretch that's criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Corbett, the assistant federal attorney handling the
Martin case, said Thursday that law bars him from discussing grand
jury proceedings, including who has been subpoenaed or who has
testified.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not in the position to make any comment,'' said Corbett,
chief of the organized crime and racketeering unit of the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 66, was banned from contact with the Michigan program in
1997 amid allegations he gave cash and gifts to players. Federal
authorities have said they have found no evidence that Martin's
alleged gambling operation included betting on Wolverines games.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was alleged to have run an illegal gambling operation
from 1988 through 1998. Published reports said Martin and his son
ran a numbers operation at Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge complex.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a plea deal reached in March between Martin, son
Carlton and federal prosecutors was scrapped, meaning Martin could
face an indictment in a gambling and income-tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea deal, Martin had agreed to detail his involvement
with the team in exchange for a reduced sentence of no more than 15
months in jail on one count each of gambling and tax evasion that
carried possible five-year sentences on each count.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's attorney, Neil Fink, said Thursday he would not discuss
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Other former Wolverines -- the Sacramento Kings' Chris Webber,
the Indiana Pacers' Jalen Rose and the Los Angeles Clippers'
Maurice Taylor -- reportedly have been interviewed by investigators
in the past year. It is unclear whether they have been ordered to
appear before the grand jury.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Estate: Stop Using Name  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio's estate is demanding a San Francisco
playground be stripped of the legendary ballplayer's name, saying
the park is not fit for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   The estate asked a federal court in Miami to order the city and
county to remove DiMaggio's name and destroy any playground
letterhead, promotional material or signs using his name.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed Wednesday on behalf of DiMaggio, LLC., also
asks for unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees Hall of Famer and his brother Dom, an
All-Star outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, played in the park as
children. But the estate contends it is now rundown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plaintiff doesn't believe that it's a fitting park or
place that should carry the DiMaggio name,'' said Miami attorney
Jeffrey Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, a trustee and attorney for DiMaggio's estate,
said naming North Beach Playground after DiMaggio ''is both morally
and legally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I promised Joe, not only during the years I was with him but
also on his deathbed, to protect his name at whatever sacrifice to
myself,'' Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio died last year at his home in Hollywood, Fla., at
age 84.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint includes charges of false endorsement and federal
trademark dilution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendant should not be given carte blanche to name the
city junk yard, the city waste dump, in this case the North Beach
Playground, or any other such facility after Joe DiMaggio, without
consent,'' it reads.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Newsom, a member of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, said the complaint's description of the playground was
insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ''That he would relate it in any way to a city dump or a waste
yard is an outrage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said that a $3.5 million renovation is to begin on the
park this month.
</P>
<P>
   The playground was named Joe DiMaggio North Beach Playground in
February 1980, however the name was not official until this past
May 5, when San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said name change ''fell through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg has said he's just trying to protect the value of the
DiMaggio name. Allowing use of the name without permission dilutes
that value, causing financial problems for the estate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom noted that Engelberg has signed a $2 million book deal
about his relationship with DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we're dealing with someone who can potentially
gain from this controversy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio has said that he has no problem with the park using
DiMaggio's name.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where we played as kids. It's only a block from where
we lived,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   However, the complaint notes that Dom DiMaggio does not speak
for the estate and ''was not even included in the will.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dominic DiMaggio owns real estate in the North Beach
Playground area which would benefit from the use of the Joe
DiMaggio name in the neighborhood,'' the complaint reads.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.5-acre park has tennis courts, a swimming pool, playground
equipment and a bocci court.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco adopted a resolution in March 1999 to memorialize
DiMaggio. In a letter to Engelberg last June, Newsom suggested 10
sites, including the North Beach Playground, the San
Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge and the San Francisco Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg wrote back saying DiMaggio's first choices would have
been the bridge and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Newsom in February, Engelberg again said he did
not approve of naming the playground in honor of DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   The city attorney's office in San Francisco has said Engelberg's
concern can extend only to the commercial use of the name and
doesn't extend to the city naming a public site after someone. And
the mayor agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will prevail in any legal challenges coming from Mr.
Engelberg,'' said Ron Vinson, Brown's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing before U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard has not been
set.

<HEADLINE> Committee approves school construction bill; final passage uncertain </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Costs would be capped and building plans
subject to legislative review under a new version of the school
construction bill released by a key Assembly committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill, which limits total spending by poor districts to
$6 billion and suburban districts to $2.5 billion, faces an
uncertain future before the full Assembly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday released the bill
by a party line tally, 7-4. More significantly, members did so
without recommendation, sending a signal to the full Assembly that
they held their noses when they voted.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who control the lower house, said they were
disturbed by the measure's massive pricetag, despite the inclusion
of a spending cap.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Democrats protested the spending limits and the
prospect of legislative oversight, saying such controls may doom
the bill to the constitutional scrapheap.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican spokesman said later it is unclear whether the bill
will pass with the minimum 41 votes Monday. If it doesn't, it's
unclear how the Legislature will meet the state Supreme Court's
spring deadline to provide full state funding to replace or repair
crumbling, overcrowded school buildings in the state's poor
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess for some Republicans, they still have qualms. If
that's the party position, there could be problems,'' said Assembly
GOP spokesman Chuck Leitgeb, who also laid blame for the bill's
questionable prospects at the feet of opposing Assembly Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly version differs from a bill already passed by the
Senate in the following ways:
</P>
<P>
   -- Spending cap. Although both bills assume total spending will
come in around $15 billion, including interest, only the Assembly
has put in a cap. Assembly sponsors used state Department of
Education estimates to place a $6 billion spending ceiling on the
30 so-called special needs districts, and a $2.5 billion cap on all
other schools.
</P>
<P>
   -- Legislative oversight. The Senate bill is silent on this
issue. In the Assembly, lawmakers want to have final say over any
projects in districts in which the state is paying the full share.
</P>
<P>
   -- Community development. The Assembly version does not contain
this Senate proposal to enable six pilot cities to dovetail
economic development projects around newly built or renovated
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's debate featured criticism of the bill from several
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra, director of the Education Law Center who sued the
state on behalf of the poor school children, said the amendments
may run afoul of recent Supreme Court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing we need is to go back to court,'' he said. ''We
don't want more litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative oversight ''would become redundant at least and
unconstitutional at worst,'' said Assemblyman Joseph Charles,
D-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner David Hespe also expressed doubts about
the constitutionality of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The caps ... are without rhyme or reason,'' said Trenton Mayor
Douglas Palmer, whose school district is considered special need.
''Also, going back for legislative approval is retarding the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Joseph Malone, R-Burlington, defended the
amendments as necessary to keep costs in line. He also justified
forcing high state aid districts to surrender local control of
building projects to the state, a mandate not forced on districts
that receive less state aid.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, took the opposite
tack. While he voted for the bill, he said he is philosophically
opposed to the state taking on such a huge debt without voter
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senate and Assembly versions contain 100 percent state
funding for the special needs districts as mandated by the court.
But that guarantee is now in doubt with the possibility that
lawmakers could veto state-aided projects in poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills allow some school districts that previously borrowed
money to pay for construction projects not yet commenced to be
eligible for state aid. The more affluent schools will be eligible
for state grants of at least 40 percent, the minimum aid level in
both bills.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Bryant Probable for Game 6  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Kobe Bryant missed practice Thursday
because of his sprained right foot, and his availability for Game 6
of the Western Conference finals is in question.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers spokesman John Black listed Bryant, an
All-NBA second team selection, as probable, but said a decision
wouldn't be made until tipoff Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson wasn't so sure, and Bryant didn't
speak with reporters before the team flew to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not ready to practice yet,'' Jackson said. ''We don't
know. We'll know game-time about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant sprained his foot early in Tuesday night's 96-88 loss to
the Trail Blazers at Staples Center that trimmed the Lakers' lead
in the best-of-seven series to 3-2 and forced a sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant played on, and not very well, especially compared to what
he did during the regular season and earlier in the playoffs.
X-rays following the game showed no fracture, and further X-rays
and an MRI on Wednesday were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not really sure right now if Kobe can play,'' backup
guard Derek Fisher said. ''If Kobe can play, he'll play. I expect
him to at least go out there and give it a shot. I don't know how
much pain he is in.
</P>
<P>
   ''If his foot isn't amputated, I expect him to give it a go.
Eighty-to-85 percent of Kobe Bryant is a lot better than a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is averaging 17.0 points, 4.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists in
the conference finals, and 21.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.2
assists in 15 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he'll be out there,'' reserve forward Robert Horry
said. ''It's the most important game of his career, so far. He'll
be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility of Bryant playing and being slowed by the
injury, Horry said, ''It might be a blessing in disguise, he won't
be able to run around so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant committed six of the Lakers' 16 turnovers in Game 5,
prompting Jackson to say he played out of control at times.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers forward Glen Rice said he believes Bryant will be limited
if he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Myself and everybody's going to have to pick up their game,''
Rice said. ''We realize he does have an injury. As a group, we have
to band together and be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant worked out lightly Wednesday, and might very well have
tried to do more had Jackson not ordered him to the sidelines. He
was dressed in practice gear Thursday, but didn't work out, instead
receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had said Wednesday he expected to be better Thursday and,
when asked if he'd be ready Friday night, replied, ''Oh,
absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said his sprained foot was no factor in his sub-par
performance in Game 5.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Convicted Athletes Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH WYATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- All professional athletes convicted of
violent crimes would be banned from playing in Wisconsin sports
facilities supported by taxpayer dollars under a bill a state
lawmaker proposed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dave Travis, D-Madison, announced the measure in the midst
of sexual assault allegations against Green Bay Packers tight end
Mark Chmura. Travis said the bill would apply to all professional
athletes and coaches, regardless of what team they play for or what
sport they play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to raise the bar and not let these guys think
they can get away with anything and have the taxpayers subsidize
it. These are supposedly role models for children,'' Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura has been charged with third-degree sexual assault for
allegedly having sex with his 17-year-old baby-sitter without the
girl's consent at a post-prom party April 9. He has said he is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chmura sure got me thinking,'' said Travis, who plans to
introduce the bill when the state Legislature returns in January.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal currently would cover only professional
players and coaches, Travis said he would consider including
college athletes in the legislation as well.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would apply to the Milwaukee Brewers Miller Park
baseball stadium and potentially to Lambeau Field. The Green Bay
Packers are seeking a sales tax increase in Brown County to help
pay for renovating the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would prevent convicted athletes from playing
at University of Wisconsin System facilities and many minor league
baseball stadiums, Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers released a statement Thursday that did not address
the proposal directly, but said the team considers player conduct a
''top priority for our sport and for all sports. ''
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League's newly enacted personal conduct
code says players who are convicted of criminal activity can be
fined, suspended or thrown out of the league.
</P>
<P>
   The code says criminal and violent behavior ''alienates the fans
on whom the success of the league depends and has negative and
sometimes tragic consequences for both the victim and the
perpetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   The league did not immediately return a telephone call The
Associated Press left Thursday seeking comment on Travis' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Jewell, a spokesman for Gov. Tommy Thompson, said Travis
was ''trying to make a point, and it's a valid point.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly violent crimes among athletes is of great concern,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell said the governor had not decided whether to support the
measure, but ''if the Legislature wants to get involved in this,
more power to them.''

<HEADLINE> US May Impose Sanctions On Fiji  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Thursday it is
considering a range of punitive actions against the military
leaders in Fiji who declared martial law on Monday following a coup
staged by rebels two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Philip Reeker said the actions being contemplated
''could have serious impact on Fiji's international contacts and on
outside assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be more specific, adding that the administration
is coordinating its response with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker also condemned what he called the ''repugnant criminal
actions'' of coup leader George Speight and his rebel companions,
who continue to hold hostages in Fiji's parliamentary complex.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages should be released immediately and unconditionally,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States opposes any unconstitutional change of
government in the Republic of the Fiji Islands,'' Reeker said.
''The consequences of any such action would be substantial and
detrimental to Fiji's standing in the international community.''

<HEADLINE> 'Lost Colony' Production To Open  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANTEO, N.C. (AP) -- The 63-year-old production of ''The Lost
Colony'' will be spiced up with an extra kiss and more romance in
hopes of drawing a younger audience to the drama about the English
settlement that vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance has been declining at the outdoor theater on Roanoke
Sound, in sight of the towering Jockey's Ridge sand dune and the
condos at Nags Head. Last summer, attendance was 74,000, down from
98,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which opens Friday and runs through Aug. 25, is
considered the country's longest-running outdoor drama with a
professional company of actors. Launched in 1937, the play closed
only during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Salgado, a former dancer and singer in the production and
now its chief executive, wants to attract 100,000 people this year.
She decided to emphasize the characters' romance after observing
the popularity of two hit movies that did much the same thing --
''Shakespeare in Love'' and ''Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got this group on the beach, and if we're not
entertaining we won't get them,'' Salgado said. ''We're trying to
market to the twentysomethings, to walk that fine balance between
educating and entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Billboards and flyers feature lead characters John Borden and
Eleanor Dare in a near embrace as they gaze into one another's
eyes. Borden and Dare are star-crossed lovers -- she's an aristocrat
and he's a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The drama goes back to 1587, when English colonists landed in
North America and the first English child, Virginia Dare, was born
in the new world. The colony disappeared, leaving as the only clue
the word ''Croatoan'' carved on a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''It deals more with passion and emotion than skin and sexual
sensation,'' said director Drew Scott Harris. ''What we lack in
exposed skin, it makes up in exposed hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, Dare arrives in the New World pregnant, although it
is unclear whether her husband, who gets killed, is the baby's
father. Dare once was portrayed as weak and dependent, but this
year is seen as a gutsy woman.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Paul Green's work is ''a very literate script,''
Harris said. ''A lot of the emotional stuff is not sitting there on
top of the words. You have to dig into the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers have told Harris the original play was ''wild with
emotion.'' But over the years, the play turned into a drier
historical drama focusing on the mystery of the colony's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   One difference this year will be the extra kiss between Dare and
Borden. The smooch occurs in the first act to whet romantic
appetites before the original second-act kiss. Harris also gives
Native American characters cleaner diction, instead of portraying
them as illiterate savages as former productions have.
</P>
<P>
   Another character adjustment involves the Indian chief Wanchese.
In the past, he was portrayed as a villain, but this year his
character will have more feeling as well as a family.
</P>
<P>
   The production is prey to the Outer Banks' sometimes oppressive
summer heat and humidity. The audience sits outside and actors
change in uncooled dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Only the costume designer and stitchers have an air-conditioned
work space, where the costumes also are kept, including the
60-pound skirt worn by the queen and Chief Manteo's cape, covered
with more than 3,000 pheasant feathers.
</P>
<P>
   The humidity and salt air also mean a dozen or more loads of
laundry are done daily and actors cannot wear microphones, but must
use ground mikes.

<HEADLINE> GOP primary contenders in final debate in race for U.S. Senate  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- The four Republicans running for the
U.S. Senate nomination took their last chance before the June 6
primary to build their credibility and to diminish that of their
opponents at a debate here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, state Sen. William
Gormley, R-Atlantic, Essex County Executive Jim Treffinger and
Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin faced off before their first
live audience at the Jewish Community Center. It was the only one
of their five debates not to be broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Franks and Gormley stand as the perceived front-runners by
virtue of their moderate views, their county endorsements, in which
Franks has an edge, and their money, in which Gormley has an edge.
To lay claim to the conservative wing of the party, Treffinger has
been waging a one-man war of words with the fourth candidate,
Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin, a former Libertarian who
stands alone in opposition to abortion and to all gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree the contest is close. The only polls of the GOP race,
which are now weeks old, have shown it to be too close to call,
especially with the likelihood of a low voter turnout Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A lively topic among them is likely to be the other side of the
aisle, where Democratic hopeful Jon Corzine has shattered national
spending records with a flurry of TV commercials and opponent Jim
Florio has been raising alarms that Corzine is a threat to
democracy.

<HEADLINE> Judge Lowers Bail for Phillips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- A judge reduced bail Thursday to
$130,000 for Lawrence Phillips, the former NFL running back accused
of beating his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Hills Superior Court Judge Linda Lefkowitz agreed to a
defense request to cut Phillips' bail from $630,000, which another
judge set Wednesday at the recommendation of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 25, is charged with three felony and three misdemeanor
counts for the alleged beating at his Beverly Hills home Saturday.
He remains in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The former Nebraska star's girlfriend was treated at the scene
for her injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is charged with felony counts of corporal injury to a
cohabitant, making a terrorist threat and conspiring to dissuade a
witness. The misdemeanor counts involve having a concealed firearm
in a vehicle, carrying a loaded firearm and vandalism with damage
under $400.
</P>
<P>
   A first-round draft choice of the St. Louis Rams in 1996,
Phillips was later released for insubordination. He was
subsequently released by the Miami Dolphins after a misdemeanor
battery conviction in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He revived his career with stellar play in NFL Europe last year
and was signed by the San Francisco 49ers, only to be cut for
missing practice.

<HEADLINE> Uncertainty Hits Venezuela Economy  </HEADLINE>
By FABIOLA SANCHEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Economists say the political
uncertainty surrounding President Hugo Chavez's ''social
revolution'' is hurting rich and poor alike, and could be prolonged
by the suspension of last weekend's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is the government isn't dealing with the economic
issues because of politics,'' said Juan Calvo, president of
Conindustria, Venezuela's largest private business organization.
''Independently of whether we have elections right now, the
government must deal with the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chavez is expected to outline a series of measures aimed
at jump-starting the economy, business leaders remain cautious.
They say the president's repeated verbal attacks on the private
sector and the electoral crisis are having a negative effect.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are hesitant and need to see a strong government plan,
said Ricardo Penfold, economist with Santander Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices have helped Venezuela, the world's third
biggest petroleum exporter. The extra oil income has been offset by
$3.5 billion leaving the country in the first quarter of this year,
private economists said. However, Central Bank director Armando
Leon told The Associated Press on Thursday the figure was closer to
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's capital flight was $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Calvo said the economic woes could be prolonged by the
uncertainty caused by the postponement of the May 28 vote --
Venezuela's sixth national election in a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the country's highest court suspended the balloting,
citing a lack of ''credibility and transparency'' caused by
technical difficulties. The temporary legislature must now set a
new election date.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling and the resignation of the country's
five-member National Election Council have sparked protests and
raised political tensions in this South American nation of 23
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters gathered Thursday outside the capitol building in
downtown Caracas chanting, ''Venezuelans want elections!''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Venezuela has been in limbo since Chavez pushed
through a new constitution last year that dissolved the Congress
and called for new elections to ''re-legitimize'' more than 6,200
public offices as part of a ''social revolution'' through radical
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, like much of Latin America, Venezuela is battling
to regain its footing after months of recession. But as countries
like Mexico and Brazil are rebounding, Venezuela's financial
picture remains unfavorable despite the largest oil reserves
outside the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's growth stood at 0.3 percent for the first three
months of 2000, much better than a 7 percent decline last year but
slower than economists had hoped. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate
hit 15.3 percent. Calvo said 44,000 jobs, especially in
construction in services, were lost -- on top of an estimated
600,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez received some good news Thursday, when the Central Bank
said the inflation rate was 1 percent in May compared to 1.5
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say Chavez's apparent success in controlling
inflation is due to little demand and a slowdown in economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the normally stable petroleum industry has suffered despite
high oil prices, largely because of the government's decision to
reduce output as part of its strategy to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 600 medium and small petroleum-related
businesses shut down, said Hugo Hernandez, vice president of the
Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Third Baseman Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox third baseman John Valentin
underwent surgery on his left knee Thursday by a doctor who the
club said it did not authorize.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's agent, Dick Moss, said Valentin returned to his New
Jersey home after the surgery in New York by Dr. David Altchek, the
team physician for the Mets. Valentin, who had surgery performed by
Altchek on the same knee last November, is expected to miss the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox said they had no information on Thursday's operation
to correct a ruptured patellar tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the club's efforts to coordinate the medical care,
John Valentin went to a physician that was not authorized by the
club to perform the procedure,'' Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said ''I'm at a loss to understand'' the team's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody from the Red Sox, (general manager) Dan Duquette or
anybody, has called me to indicate there is any problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea refused to say whether the team was upset with Valentin's
choice of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Red Sox team physician, had said
Wednesday that he expected Altchek to perform the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said Altchek was authorized by the Red Sox to perform the
surgery last November, when scar tissue around Valentin's patellar
tendon was cleaned out. Altchek also repaired a small cartilage
tear. He also has performed surgery on Boston pitcher Bret
Saberhagen's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who went on the disabled list April 10 with patellar
tendinitis in his left knee, had started just eight games since he
returned to the roster on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The latest injury occurred in the second inning Tuesday night
against Kansas City when he collapsed while charging a grounder by
Carlos Beltran.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said Altchek is one of the top three orthopedic surgeons in
the country and is on a list agreed to by the owners and the
players association of doctors to be consulted for second opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sort of resent the fact that they say John did anything
improper,'' Moss said. ''It's not like John went to some
fly-by-night guy. This is one of the leading guys in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what they have in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, 33, is in his ninth major-league season, all with the
Red Sox. He has the longest tenure on the team and entered the
season batting .283. This season, he batted .257 with two homers
and two RBIs in 35 at bats over 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   He is signed through the 2001 season with a club option for
2002.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Plans Retreat  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With U.N. peacekeeping operations under
fire, Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Security Council members
planned a weekend retreat Friday in an effort to figure out what
has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The informal meeting -- the second one in as many years -- comes
at a crucial time for the organization, which is still reeling from
the seizure of 500 U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone but is also
gearing up for the deployment of a 5,500-strong mission to the
Congo and a doubling of its force in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're right in the middle of important missions and more
coming up,'' John Ruggie, Annan's special adviser, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general ''wanted to take this opportunity, before
we deploy in Congo and Lebanon, to see what lessons ... we learned
from the recent cases that we should be applying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruggie said the retreat at the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico
Hills, New York, would give the council a chance to discuss the
details of peacekeeping policy that fail to get addressed in daily
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone is certain to feature prominently in the weekend
discussions of the 15 council ambassadors, as it represents the
most serious threat to international peacekeeping since the U.N.
debacle in the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels of the Revolutionary United Front, who signed a peace
agreement with the government last year, took the U.N. peacekeepers
hostage last month and held them for more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has said the rebels were able to take
advantage of the young U.N. mission sent to oversee the peace
agreement because the troops volunteered by member governments --
many from poor African countries -- arrived without proper training
or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said Thursday that during the weekend retreat, he would
raise the issue of better equipping and preparing U.N.
peacekeepers, particularly with a dangerous mission coming up in
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they will need to go in with heavier equipment -- not
necessarily to do battle, but sometimes you need to show force in
order not to use it,'' Annan said in Atlanta during an hourlong
forum on CNN. ''You have to have a credible presence so that they
don't even dare to challenge you.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan has been increasingly critical of the Western response to
the peacekeeping challenges facing the United Nations, saying the
organization cannot be expected to keep the peace in Security
Council-mandated missions if council members such as the United
States aren't willing to finance them.
</P>
<P>
   He has also recently said the United Nations needs to review how
it decides to deploy peacekeeping missions and under what
conditions it sends troops into the field.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Open Fire on Belize Boat  </HEADLINE>
By KARLA HEUSNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELIZE CITY, Belize (AP) -- Halfway through a commuter boat ride,
three crew members suddenly opened fire on the captain and
passengers, killing at least five people and throwing surviving
women and children overboard, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three survivors said they spent 17 hours floating together in
the Gulf of Honduras until a fisherman discovered them Wednesday
morning. Others drowned one by one as they waited for rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just opened fire like nothing, like crazy. They just
shot,'' said 21-year-old passenger Evelyn Rojas, describing the
assault Tuesday on the boat ''Maria Estela,'' which had been taking
passengers from Guatemala to Belize.
</P>
<P>
   There was no known motive for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying 10 passengers and a crew of five, the 28-foot skiff
left Guatemala's Puerto Barrios on Tuesday afternoon for the
normally uneventful trip through the Gulf of Honduras in the
Caribbean Sea to Belize's Punta Gorda.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour into the voyage, as the light craft neared
Guatemala's maritime border, the three mutineers grabbed assault
weapons they had hidden under boxes and turned them on the
passengers, authorities and survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   Five passengers apparently were shot dead immediately,
Guatemalan Naval Capt. Jose Maria Valladres said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said she jumped into the water and tried to swim as far
from the boat as possible, grabbing a life jacket and hanging on
amid a shower of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants, meanwhile, shot other passengers and threw
women, children and an elderly man overboard, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, Julio Requena Jr., jumped into the water after
being shot, but the gunmen continued to fire on him in the water,
said passenger Larry Smith, an American who has lived in Belize for
27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Requena managed to avoid being shot again, not long
after the assault ended he ''told us goodbye and disappeared into
the water,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, a Belizean tour cruiser recovered the bodies of
two Belizeans, a Honduran man and two Guatemalans, all of whom had
been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the three passengers who were rescued, the others
aboard had not been accounted for, and authorities said some may be
hostages aboard the boat, which was still missing. Belizean naval
boats were searching for the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Although Guatemala and Belize have been locked in a border
dispute since January, both sides agreed the attack was not
politically motivated.

Jury acquits 3 inmates in 3 weeks
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) -- A state prison could have intervened in the
case of a 21-year-old inmate who claimed the plastic shank he
possessed was for self-defense against a former cellmate who tried
to molest him, a jury ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's acquittal of the promoting prison contraband charge
against Kareem Young, an inmate at Elmira Correctional Facility,
keeps Young from having an additional seven years added to his
current five-year sentence for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in three weeks that a Chemung County jury
has acquitted an inmate at the maximum security prison on a charge
that would have extended his sentence. And Chemung County Public
Defender Richard W. Rich Jr. says the acquittals reflect the
injustices that sometimes occur within prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   Young was charged with possessing a plastic shank during a fight
with an inmate in a shack in the prison's recreation field.
</P>
<P>
   Rich said Johnson had a history of problems with the inmate,
Patrick Johnson, while they were sharing a cell at the prison, and
that Johnson allegedly tried to molest Young in their cell.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had subsequently been moved by correction officers into
a different cell, Rich said, and Young had told staff before the
fight that he feared for his life because Johnson had threatened
him, Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young did everything he could to report the thing before it
happened,'' Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   Rich successfully defended two other inmates in unrelated cases
during the last three weeks. On May 25, a jury found 31-year-old
Michael Henriquez innocent of assaulting another inmate. He was
facing life imprisonment if he was convicted, Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, Rich argued that a correction officer had planted a
weapon on Elmira Correctional Facility inmate Dean Andrea, 27,
because the officer had a grudge against Andrea.

<HEADLINE> Report: Packers To Release Chmura  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers will release tight end
Mark Chmura on Monday, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an anonymous source ''closely connected to the matter,''
the newspaper said Thursday the Packers plan to cut ties with the
former All-Pro who was accused of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old
girl at a post-prom party on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Chmura, 31, and Robert Gessert, 43, were
ordered to stand trial in Waukesha County on third-degree sexual
assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf was out of his office
Thursday afternoon and was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura's agent, Eric Metz, could not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've read a million reports that say he's going to get cut,''
Metz said Thursday. ''But I haven't heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Metz said Chmura, who declared his innocence earlier this week,
plans to speak publicly Saturday about his future in football and
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura's release has been widely expected since shortly after
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing Chmura after June 1, the Packers will gain $900,000
in salary cap room that could be used to sign free agents. Chmura
signed a five-year, $15 million contract -- which included a $3
million signing bonus -- during the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, who became one of the game's elite tight ends during the
Packers' run to consecutive Super Bowl appearances, missed all but
two games last season with a neck injury that caused partial
paralysis in his arms and threatened to end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Metz said he hasn't considered whether Chmura will have a future
in football beyond the Packers. Metz publicly urged his client to
retire last season because of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Packers' decision could be based more on their
concerns about his health than his guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't assume anything in this business ... but I also
assume that he's innocent too, and that he'll be acquitted on all
charges,'' Metz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And what happens when he's acquitted of all this? Are they
releasing him because of (the incident)? Are they releasing him
because of the injury? That's going to be the speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was planning to play in the upcoming season before his
arrest. Prosecutors say Chmura had sex with the 17-year-old girl --
who was once a baby sitter for Chmura's two children -- in a
bathroom at Gessert's home without her consent. An 18-year-old
woman said Gessert fondled her while they were in a hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, who faces a 10-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine,
is due back in court on June 23 to enter a plea. No trial date has
been set.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers began planning for Chmura's departure less than a
week after his arrest. They selected tight end Bubba Franks with
its first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura did not participate in the team's two minicamps since his
arrest and wasn't expected at the team's fourth and final minicamp,
which begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In seven seasons with the Packers, Chmura became one of Brett
Favre's favorite targets, catching 188 passes for 2,253 yards and
17 touchdowns. Favre said Chmura's absence last season was a strong
factor in the Packers' slump to an 8-8 record that cost coach Ray
Rhodes his job.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Offers Peace Overtures  </HEADLINE>
By ABEBE ANDUALEM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- After abruptly declaring the Horn
of Africa war over, Ethiopia shifted from fighting to diplomacy
with its neighbor Thursday -- offering to return all newly captured
land if Eritrea joins it in a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Eritreans studied their enemy's sudden peace overtures,
suspicious after a 2-year border war of surprise invasions and
attacks on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war will never be finished because Ethiopia will never be
satisfied. They want to reach Asmara,'' said Milke Kebede, an
18-year-old student in the streets of the Eritrean capital.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations waited Thursday for word from 3-day-old peace talks
in Algiers, where Ethiopia pressed its agenda on Eritrea in
indirect talks through African, European and U.S. envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Mediators are trying to broker a cease-fire and a lasting accord
over the two neighbors' disputed 620-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   Success of the negotiations appears now to hinge on details of
Ethiopia's withdrawal from Eritrea and security arrangements on the
long-disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't ask me for blind optimism, but I have no reason to doubt
that we'll succeed,'' Ahmed Ouyahia, the lead envoy in the
Organization for African Unity-sponsored talks, told reporters in
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   The international peace push was prompted by Ethiopia's
steamrolling 19-day offensive into western and southern Eritrea
last month. Saying it had retaken all land seized by its smaller
neighbor at the outset of the war, Ethiopia on Thursday declared
the offensive and the war itself over.
</P>
<P>
   With the apparent advantage, Ethiopia said it now stood ready to
negotiate directly with Eritrea -- something it had always refused
to do while Eritrea held disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea rejected that offer until Ethiopian forces leave the
towns, villages and miles of undisputed Eritrean soil seized in the
May offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before any (direct) discussion, there is a need to fulfill the
obligations of stopping the war and withdrawing,'' Eritrean Foreign
Minister Haile Weldensae told The Associated Press at the talks in
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia says it will leave the land only with a cease-fire, and
with international assurances of an as-yet unspecified nature for
Ethiopia's security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are calling on the international community to give us
guarantees that Eritrea will not repeat its madness of invading
neighbors,'' Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said during a
break at the Algiers peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The two neighbors, among the world's 10 poorest countries, at
times spent up to an estimated $1 million a day arming and manning
for their border conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The war cost the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and
civilians on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea says the latest offensive alone displaced more than a
half-million of its people. Refugees fled north and east to escape
the fighting, some escaping by donkey and foot into neighboring
Sudan and others washing up on the shores of Yemen after crossing
the Red Sea in fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' refugee agency in Geneva said Thursday it
was waiting for word of Ethiopia's withdrawal from Eritrea so it
could deliver relief unhindered.
</P>
<P>
   For some in Eritrea, a nation whose esteem is wrapped up in the
legacy of the sandal-clad fighters who fought a 30-year guerrilla
war for independence -- peace on Ethiopia's terms seemed to come at
a high price in pride and land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eritrea does not want to lose the war,'' said Haile Brhane, a
51-year-old portrait painter in the Eritrean capital. ''How can you
live at peace if you lose your possessions?''

<HEADLINE> Bengals Release Ki-Jana Carter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ki-Jana Carter, whose NFL career was ill-fated
from the start, was released Thursday by the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The former Penn State running back was the No. 1 overall pick in
the 1995 draft but missed that entire season when he tore an
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   He played only one game in 1998 after severely fracturing his
wrist in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   He was sidelined in 1999 when he dislocated his right kneecap in
the third game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ki-Jana came into the NFL with tremendous ability, but his
injuries took away his chance to reach his potential,'' Bengals
president Mike Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect him a great deal for the way he kept battling with a
positive attitude through a lot of adversity. We sincerely wish his
association with our team could have had a more positive outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter played in just 35 games in five years and rushed for 747
yards on 227 carries with 16 touchdowns. He also had 52 catches for
375 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Carter started 14 games for the Bengals, first losing the
starting job to Garrison Hearst and then to Corey Dillon, who has
had three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Carter dislocated his kneecap again in a private
workout. Team doctors examined the knee Wednesday and said it would
be six to eight weeks -- nearly the start of the preseason -- before
Carter could return to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame. I love Ki-Jana. He's a great kid,'' coach Bruce
Coslet said. ''But his problem is durability. After hearing the
reports from our doctors and the uncertainty of it, we have to go
with other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bengals probably would not have released Carter at
this time -- and taken a double hit -- if they had been able to waive
dissident wide receiver Carl Pickens. But the Bengals could not get
definitive word by the 4 p.m. deadline on the status of the NFL
Players Association's grievance over the franchise player
designation assigned to Pickens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand they that they have to do what they have to do,''
Carter said Wednesday, anticipating the move. ''I'm just trying to
get my knee ready for the season.''

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, US Said To Fix Military  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- After 21 years, the United States and
Nicaragua have normalized their military relations, Nicaragua's
ambassador to Washington said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government accredited former Sandinista officer Brig.
Gen. Manuel Salvatierra as military attache to the Nicaraguan
Embassy in Washington on Wednesday, Nicaraguan Ambassador Francisco
Aguirre Sacasa said Thursday by telephone. The U.S. State
Department was unavailable for immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua and the United States had a tense relationship during
the 10-year leftist Sandinista regime, which had close ties to Cuba
and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Nicaraguan relationship improved dramatically after the
Sandinistas were deposed in 1990 in an election and were replaced
by a pro-U.S. government. Relations became much closer after
Hurricane Mitch in 1998, when the U.S. government sent 1,700 troops
to Nicaragua to help build roads and build health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has a tremendous symbolic impact, because it's the
finalization of the last traces of the Cold War between the main
world powers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Sandinista fighter in the 1970s, Salvatierra became a top
military official in the 1980s, when his forces were fighting the
U.S.-backed ''Contra'' rebels.

<HEADLINE> State says inmates set cell fire  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- An investigation indicates the two
inmates injured in a fire at the Northern Correctional Institution
set the items inside their cell ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Correction Capt. Heather Ziemba said Thursday the
department was still investigating to determine what the two men
used to start the fire in their cell Wednesday night and how they
got the materials. Smoking is not allowed in Connecticut prisons.
</P>
<P>
   One of the inmates is awaiting trial for the Jan. 23, 1999 fatal
shooting of East Hartford police Officer Brian Aselton. Alex
Sostre, 25, was treated at Johnson Memorial Hospital for smoke
inhalation. His cellmate, Pedro Poupart, 18, a New Haven man
serving 17 months for assault on a police or fire officer, was
being treated for minor burns at the MacDougall Correctional
Institution in Suffield.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines, papers, boxes, mattresses and bedding were set ablaze
in the fire, which guards spotted during routine rounds about 7:45
p.m. in a unit housing about 50 inmates, including residents of
Connecticut's death row.
</P>
<P>
   Six guards used extinguishers to largely doused the flames. When
30 firefighters arrived at the Somers prison about 10 minutes
later, the fire was smoldering and the inmates had been moved to
another area of the prison, Somers fire Chief Bill Meier said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cell was fully involved, but the fire did not spread, Meier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both prison and municipal officials said planned emergency
procedures were followed and worked well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went like clockwork,'' said Somers First Selectman Gordon
Mello, who was leading a town meeting on funding for a new million
firehouse when his emergency pager went off. ''The first thought
that ran through my mind was 'Gee, I hope this is a test.' Then I
heard the sirens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziemba said that at no time was public safety threatened or the
security of the prison compromised. The evacuated prisoners were
held in other secure areas of the prison for about four hours, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The firefighters never felt threatened at all,'' Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   A third inmate, Julio Gomez, 29, was treated at Johnson Memorial
after he became unruly during the evacuation and was subdued with
pepper spray, Ziemba said. The Meriden man is serving three years
for violation of probation; his record includes burglary, larceny
and drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was being evacuated for his safety and he was
noncompliant,'' Ziemba said. ''In order to get him under control
and protect him, he was restrained with pepper spray.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire marked the first time the town's firefighters were
called to the prison since 1997, when the Department of Correction
disbanded its fire department. The prison houses more than 430 of
Connecticut's worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Meier said his department is not usually called to minor fires
at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the fact that we were responding led us to believe it was
a bigger fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the first selectman said the public was never at risk and he
remained at the town meeting, where officials gave final approval
to a $2.2 million firehouse already under construction
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt very comfortable continuing my duties,'' Mello said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Targets Chechnya's Mountains  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pounded Chechnya's
mountains with warplanes and artillery Thursday, trying to drive
hundreds of rebels out of their strongholds, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials in Chechnya also claimed that Aslan Maskhadov,
the elected president of Chechnya, had been wounded in the most
recent fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov was wounded overnight outside the village of Malye
Shuani in the Nozhai-Yurt region, where Russian forces have
directed much of their bombing and shelling, said a spokesman in
Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, which is under Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be confirmed independently. Russia's chief
military spokesman on Chechnya, deputy chief of the general staff
Gen. Valery Manilov, said the report was ''on the level of rumors
that require confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov commanded the Chechen forces that drove Russian troops
out of the separatist republic in the 1994-96 war. But since
becoming president he has been unable to exert control over Chechen
warlords and Russian officials have said he has only several
hundred fighters under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov estimated Thursday that about 2,500 rebels ''capable of
vigorous actions'' remain in Chechnya. The rebels have been
concentrated in the mountains since the bulk of the fighters fled
the capital Grozny in early February, but have continued to mount
sporadic attacks in Grozny and elsewhere in Russian-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 600 fighters had been surrounded in the rugged region
around Nozhai-Yurt in southeastern Chechnya. Russian ground troops
were refraining from close-quarters fighting with the militants,
trying instead to pinpoint rebel positions for air and artillery
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has relied on that tactic throughout the nine-month
campaign to subdue the rebellious republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops launched a major operation Monday to clear the
region and the neighboring district of Vedeno of rebels. The area
has been a stronghold of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Russian losses have reached 2,331 killed and 6,798 wounded since
fighting in the North Caucasus region of Russia began in August,
Manilov told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said Russian troops in May killed 393 rebels and
destroyed about 100 rebel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The military has often exaggerated the damage it has done to
militant formations and their equipment, and the claim could not be
verified.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rebels have not mounted large-scale operations
recently, they have stepped up ambushes that have inflicted serious
casualties on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the second-ranking Russian civilian official in
Chechnya, Sergei Zveryev, was killed when remote-controlled bombs
blew up his car on the outskirts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb attack underscored the rebels' ability to hit back in
areas long under nominal Russian control. Russian officials say
some rebels have melted into the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also blames Chechen rebels for the explosion that killed
three soldiers in the southern Russian city of Volgograd on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops, whom the rebels pushed out of Chechnya in
1994-96, re-entered in September after Chechnya-based militants
seized villages in Dagestan and after about 300 people died in
apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 2, Orioles 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Bryan Rekar came within two outs of
his first career shutout as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the
Baltimore Orioles 2-1 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave Tampa Bay its first two-game winning streak
since May 11-12. The Devil Rays spilt the four-game series against
Baltimore, stopping a skid that saw them drop eight straight
series.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar (2-3) took a five-hitter into the ninth inning before
allowing a one-out solo homer to Brady Anderson. Roberto Hernandez
came on and got two outs for his sixth save in 10 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar struck out four and walked none to get his first win as a
starter since beating Florida last July 10. Over his previous four
starts this season -- including three losses -- Rekar allowed 15
earned runs in 17 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore starter Scott Erickson (2-2) allowed two runs and
eight hits in his first complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the third in nine games for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff's RBI-single in the first inning gave Tampa Bay a
1-0 lead. McGriff, who hit his 399th homer in the Devil Rays' 4-3
win over Baltimore on Wednesday, moved within four hits of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams' run-scoring single in the fifth gave Tampa Bay
a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who were held without an extra base hit for just
the third time this season Wednesday, had just three singles and
didn't advance runner past first base through five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar retired nine straight before Anderson had a two-out double
in the sixth. Anderson was left stranded when Mike Bordick grounded
out.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle, who was the Orioles' designated hitter for the
second time in the series, went 2-for-3. He has hit in 12 of his
past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Baltimore 3B Cal Ripken Jr. extended his major league
record of hitting into double plays to 331 in the second inning.
... Devil Rays SS Felix Martinez has a hit in all seven games he's
played since being recalled from Triple-A Durham last Friday. ...
Baltimore's Charles Johnson has an eight-game hitting streak, two
short of his career-high. ... Baltimore DH Harold Baines, who is
hitting just .233, was out of the starting lineup for the second
time in the series. Jeff Conine replaced Belle, who was the DH for
the seventh time this season, in right field.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls For Elian Protest  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Thursday called a demonstration of a
half-million women for Friday morning to protest a U.S. court
decision that would keep Elian Gonzalez from returning to his
homeland for at least another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The march of Cuban mothers and grandmothers would be the largest
single rally since the beginning of the international custody
dispute began after Elian was rescued at sea in late November.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. appellate court panel sided Thursday with Elian's father
in the 6-month-old international custody battle, saying that
immigration officials had been entitled to deny an asylum hearing
for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But under the ruling, Elian must remain in the United States for
14 days to give his Miami relatives a chance to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not cross our arms in the face of this prolonging of
the injustice and the crime,'' the government said in a statement
read Thursday on state television.
</P>
<P>
   The statement decried Elian's ''cruel and interminable wait to
return to the bosom of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Even members of a visiting American congressional delegation
found the additional delay frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like the family in Miami will just want to drag this
on,'' said U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat in
Havana this week with members of the congressional Black Caucus.
''I don't understand it. It's clear that the child should be in the
custody of his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have fought to keep Elian with them in the
United States, arguing that they can give him a better life off the
communist island. Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has
demanded his parental rights as the child's sole surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother and 10 others perished in late November when
their boat sank during a journey from Cuba to the United States.
Two men on a fishing trip rescued Elian off the Florida coast after
finding him floating on an innertube.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives were given temporary custody of Elian,
who immediately became the subject of an international tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez traveled to the United States on April 6 in
hopes of reclaiming his son and returning with him to the island,
but the Miami relatives refused to turn the child over to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son were reunited on April 22 after Elian was taken
forcibly from the Miami relatives' home during an armed federal
raid. Elian has since lived with his father in the Washington area
while awaiting the decision.

<HEADLINE> GOP primary contenders have final debate in race for U.S. Senate  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- The four Republicans running for the
U.S. Senate had one final chance to blitz each other before the
June 6 primary here Thursday, but a restrictive debate format
watered it down.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, state Sen. William
Gormley, R-Atlantic, Essex County Executive Jim Treffinger and
Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin now head their own ways to
hit the street and perhaps the airwaves to impress undecided
Republicans and to make sure the people in their corners show up
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Franks and Gormley stand as the perceived front-runners by
virtue of their moderate views, their county endorsements, in which
Franks has an edge, and their money, in which Gormley has an edge.
Treffinger has joined the leaders by raising more than $1 million
while Sabrin, the former Libertarian, stands alone in the pack by
opposing abortion and all gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to lay claim to the party's conservatives,
Treffinger has been waging a one-man war of words with Sabrin.
However, little of it surfaced Thursday before about 200 people at
the Jewish Community Center here. It was the last of five debates
and the only one not broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree the GOP primary contest is close. The only polls
taken showed it to be virtually too close to call, especially with
the likelihood of a low voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The format kept the candidates from hacking at one another and
also gave them no chance to provide contrasting answers on the same
issues. Many of the questions veered toward foreign policy matters
that have had a minor role in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions, however, did lead candidates into tricky ground.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about campaign finance and his donations from casino
industries, which are prohibited for state office candidates,
Gormley ducked the specific question and said he had always worked
for the best interests of the constituents of his Atlantic
County-based district. ''That's the main criteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, who has criticized Gormley for casino donations, had no
opportunity to continue that attack Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger, who has supported the use of school vouchers in
struggling urban districts, took it a step further Thursday by
claiming such vouchers would actually save taxpayers money because
parochial school tuition in Jersey City, for instance, costs less
than the per-pupil costs of the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said the Kosovo operation required the approval of
Congress and lacked a defined mission and ''exit strategy.'' Sabrin
took it further, denouncing the entire air war. ''We actually
killed more people with our own bombs than the Serbians killed in
Kosovo,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had a light moment when one panelist referred to
''Professor Gormley.'' Gormley drew laughs when he started
clowning, signaling a ''time out'' and pantomiming a wall between
himself and the actual professor, Sabrin.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin opposes gun control laws. ''NRA,'' Gormley said, pointing
to Sabrin, then pointed to himself, adding, ''No NRA.''

<HEADLINE> Crash Survivors Mark Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- One year after the crash of American
Airlines Flight 1420, survivors marked the anniversary Thursday
with a memorial service and their first look at the charred
wreckage of the jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was amazing to me after seeing the plane that so many of us
were able to survive, that we were able to make it out,'' said
survivor Jeff Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, of Anchorage, Alaska, spent two hours in the hangar
housing the wreckage looking for seat 8D, in which he remained
unconscious for 40 minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-82, carrying 145 people, careened off the runway after
landing in Little Rock in a late night thunderstorm. Eleven people
were killed, including the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor, Mohammad Abdel of San Jose, Calif., said
seeing the plane brought back the smell of the jet fuel that
drenched him during the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if there's any good answer to why I wanted to see
it, except for there's some kind of attachment to the plane,'' said
Abdel, who suffered minor injuries in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Rowe said viewing the wreckage brought people closer
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very emotional. There were a lot of tears, a lot of
hugs and people were amazed that we were able to get out,'' she
said after looking for how she escaped the burning wreckage from
Row 14.
</P>
<P>
   During a morning memorial service, survivors dropped 11 white
wreaths into the Arkansas River, two miles from the airport. They
also released 11 doves and a bugler played taps.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all friends of the heart, not just numbers on a
passenger manifest or names in the latest news report,'' survivor
Charles Fuller told more than 200 survivors and family members at
the gathering. Fuller's 14-year-old daughter, Rachel, died from
burns suffered in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors said their anger toward the airline over the
decision to land in the violent thunderstorm was part of the reason
they attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to be quiet about the need to see changes in
airline policy and procedures,'' said Kristy Sheridan of Koppell,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines Vice Chairman Robert Baker represented the
airline but did not speak at the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad day for our American family. We are out here to
offer support. We hope our being here is a demonstration of respect
for all those families and what they have been through,'' he said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has not determined a
cause of the accident. Investigators are considering weather, pilot
error, mechanical failure or a combination of factors.
</P>
<P>
   While the survivors and their families gathered for the tearful
reunion, lawyers representing some of them in lawsuits against
American were in a federal courtroom blocks away. U.S. District
Judge Henry Woods said 34 passengers have settled lawsuits against
the airline.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Considers Retreat Location  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton is considering
establishing a rustic retreat in his childhood hometown of Hot
Springs that would be connected with his planned presidential
library and policy center.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have begun with relatives who own the estate of
Clinton's late uncle, Raymond Clinton, the library's fundraiser,
Skip Rutherford, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're considering is a retreat location associated with
the programming of the policy center,'' Rutherford said. ''But
we're in the very early stages of negotiations on this particular
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the library, which is to be built on land purchased by
the city of Little Rock, the land for the retreat would be bought
with private funds, Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-acre site includes a five-bedroom home with a screened
porch, lots of trees and a boat dock on Lake Hamilton, Rutherford
said. The property is about 50 miles southwest of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Springs already is the site of the William Jefferson Clinton
Cultural Campus, which is being developed at the former high school
Clinton attended. The school moved more than 30 years ago and the
building has been vacant for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''When one looks at a retreat location, Hot Springs is a natural
and this property is a natural,'' Rutherford said. ''What makes the
site attractive is you walk in the middle of the site and you could
be anywhere rural in the world. You don't know there is a world out
there.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Grants Amnesty In Coup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Congress has granted amnesty to
participants in January's military-backed Indian uprising that
toppled President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   But the move, approved late Wednesday by 90 of the 123
congressmen, only covers criminal prosecution in civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
   The military is still pursuing its own charges against 113 of
its members, most of them colonels, who joined hundreds of Indians
on Jan. 21 in a takeover of the Congress building and proclaimed a
short-lived junta.
</P>
<P>
   The insurrection led to Mahuad's ouster. He was replaced by his
vice president, Gustavo Noboa, who on April 12 asked congress to
grant the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa told reporters Thursday that the ''amnesty is important,
but we must continue the dialogue with all social groups in the
country so that all understand that peace brings progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the fate of the officers still facing possible court
martials, Noboa said, ''That is in the hands of the military
courts. I respect each jurisdiction, just as I would like them to
respect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Noboa accepted the resignation of three members of
the military high command, which made no attempt to put down the
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Military tribunals are trying 17 officers for their part in
Mahuad's unconstitutional overthrow.

Elian's Dad Makes Plea To Relatives
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez asked his Miami relatives today to
end their court battle to keep 6-year-old Elian in this country and allow father
and son to ''finally go back home together'' to Cuba. Speaking hours after the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with him in the 6-month-long custody battle,
Gonzalez said, ''A child simply should be with his parents, always with his
parents. As the father, I should be speaking on behalf of my son.'' In its
ruling, the three-judge panel said the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
decision that only a parent can act for a 6-year-old child in immigration
matters was reasonable.

<HEADLINE> Japan Cabinet To Dissolve Parliament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Cabinet of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on
Friday agreed to dissolve the lower house of Parliament, paving the
way for national elections on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was taken at a morning Cabinet meeting and was to
be finalized with the formal dissolution of the powerful body in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Mori has plummeted since his remark last month that
Japan is a ''divine nation'' and recent polls suggest that his
administration is the least popular to face an election since the
end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Mori has also been dogged by scandals since he assumed
leadership after his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, fell into a coma in
April. Obuchi died May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had initially expected a sizable sympathy vote for the
ruling coalition centered on Mori's Liberal Democratic Party after
Obuchi's death, but many now question whether the LDP will benefit.
June 25 would have been Obuchi's 63rd birthday.

<HEADLINE> Peru Election Protests Continue  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Defeated candidate Alejandro Toledo said
Thursday that he will continue pushing to disqualify President
Alberto Fujimori's re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is a new election in which Fujimori does not
participate,'' said Toledo, who boycotted Sunday's presidential
runoff. ''He's broken all the laws and the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, 54, said nationwide protests would continue, including d
march on Saturday in downtown Lima, followed by an all-night vigil
in front of the Organization of American States' local
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no need for a second election. This one was an
expression of the popular will,'' said Francisco Tudela, Fujimori's
vice-presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS permanent council decided Wednesday in Washington to
recommend that the controversy over the fairness of Peru's
presidential runoff be addressed in a meeting of OAS foreign
ministers scheduled to begin Sunday in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But after intense debate, the council ruled against the United
States' suggestion that the issue be taken up in the context of a
1991 resolution designed to deal with threats to democracy. The
resolution gives the ministers broad authority to take punitive
action in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo called the OAS council's decision ''a great victory''
because Peru's representative at the meeting failed in her attempt
''to discredit the OAS election observer mission'' and ''close the
case on Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   OAS election monitors left Peru two days before the vote in
protest after Fujimori's government refused to delay the runoff to
ensure the reliability of ballot-counting software.
</P>
<P>
   Other international and local monitors did the same, pronouncing
the election and the campaign that led up to it unfairly biased in
favor of Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   With Toledo boycotting the election, Fujimori, 61, won by a wide
margin. Final results announced Thursday gave Fujimori 51.2 percent
of the vote, compared to 17.7 percent for Toledo, who had asked his
supporter to spoil their ballots by marking them with the words
''no to fraud.''

<HEADLINE> UCLA's Sua Wins Discus Title  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Even while training through the NCAA Outdoor
Track and Field Championships, UCLA's Seilala Sua was good enough
to win the women's discus Thursday and make meet history.
</P>
<P>
   Sua's triumph made her the first woman to win the same field
event four times. Wisconsin's Suzy Favor is the only other woman to
win the same event four times, the 1,500 meters from 1987-1990,
with her final victory also coming at Duke's Wallace Wade stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sua, who will defend her shot put title Friday, also tied Favor
for the most overall outdoor NCAA titles by a woman. Favor also won
the 800 in 1990. Indoors and outdoors, Sua has six NCAA titles,
including this year's indoor shot put crown. Favor finished her
career with nine.
</P>
<P>
   Sua, the sixth-ranked discus thrower in the world last year and
the sixth-place finisher at the World Championships, was not
concentrating heavily on the NCAA meet because she is working
toward next month's Olympic trials and the Sydney Games in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, Art Venegas, thought the strategy might backfire.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, although Sua, the two-time U.S. champion, was not at
her sharpest. After winning her previous three NCAA titles with
throws over 200 feet, she didn't pass that distance until her final
attempt, throwing 200-9.
</P>
<P>
   ''She hasn't reached her top gear yet,'' Venegas said. ''When
she does, it will be scary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought by now she would be throwing 220 feet, but it's been
tough on her. She's not been as dominant as usual, because she
wasn't peaking for April, May or June like in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Venegas also had another reason for Sua's relatively mediocre
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons she struggled so much was because of the
weight of doing something that isn't commonly done,'' he said.
''She's basically outgrown this level of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sua put it a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very nervous on my first throw,'' she said, ''because
it's harder coming in as the favorite. I don't think it was
pressure to win. It was pressure to get a good throw.''
</P>
<P>
   In other finals, Brad Hauser led a 1-2-4 Stanford finish in the
men's 10,000, outkicking teammate Jason Balkman to win in 30
minutes, 38.57 seconds, the slowest winning time since 1956;
Christi Smith became the first NCAA champion from Akron, taking the
heptathlon with 5,797 points; Texas' Erin Aldrich won the women's
high jump at 6-2}; and LSU's Russ Buller took the men's pole vault
at 18-4{.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Joachim Olsen of Idaho won the men's shot put at 66-5};
Houston's Jenny Adams took the women's long jump at 21-5{; and
SMU's Libor Charfreitag won the men's hammer throw at 253-4,
breaking the 25-year-old stadium record and a distance that
qualified him for the Olympics for Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   In the pedestrian 10,000, Stanford almost had its third
consecutive 1-2-3 finish, but Hauser's twin brother, Brent,
collapsed just before crossing the finish line and was overtaken by
Drake's Jason Lehmkuhle.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening round of the women's 100 hurdles, Ohio State's
Donica Merriman equaled the stadium record of 12.84 and matched the
fifth-fastest time in the world this year in winning her heat.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was another hurdles heat winner in 12.87, tying the
seventh-fastest time in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas' 1,600 relay team of Melvin Lister, Sam Glover, Ryan
Stanley and Kevin Baker ran the fastest time by a collegiate team
this year and the fifth-fastest in the world, winning its heat in a
school-record 3:02.02.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Razorbacks' chances of winning a ninth consecutive
title were damaged when shot putter Marcus Clavelle, projected
among the top three, and 10,000 runner Adam Dailey, one of the
favorites who was bumped onto the inside of the track while running
fourth, both failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' women also ran a sizzling 1,600 relay heat, winning with
the world's fourth-fastest time, 3:29.74, with a team of Angel
Patterson, Nakiya Johnson, Moushaumi Robinson and Tanya Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Terrence Trammell, the world leader in the
men's 110 hurdles, easily won his opening heat in 13.61. Trammell,
also one of the favorites in the 100, ran 10.19 in his heat and
reached the semifinals despite competing with a sore left
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   LSU's Derrick Brew, the second-fastest 400 runner in the world
this year, failed to advance to the final, running 45.79 in the
heats. World No. 1 Michael Blackwood of Oklahoma won his heat in
45.17.
</P>
<P>
   There also were surprises in the women's 800 heats, as Tracy
Robertson of Arkansas and Liz Diaz of Texas, considered among the
top contenders, did not advance.

<HEADLINE> Musical giant Tito Puente dead at 77  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Musical giant Tito Puente, the Grammy-winning
''El Rey'' of big-band mambo whose pioneering sound paved the way
for Latin musicians from Carlos Santana to Marc Anthony, has died
in Manhattan. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant percussionist and bandleader, who had undergone
recent treatment for a heart ailment, died Wednesday at the New
York University Medical Center, said his agent, Eddie Rodriguez. At
his family's request, no other details were given.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before the current ''Latin explosion'' of Anthony, Ricky
Martin and Jennifer Lopez, Puente -- a contemporary of the late Desi
Arnaz -- was driving audiences to the dance floor with his animated
style and influential music. He created his own jazz by blending
Latin rhythm with the big band stylings of Tommy Dorsey or Count
Basie.
</P>
<P>
   Puente's star ascended across six decades. He earned five
Grammys as he recorded more than 100 albums in a career than began
at age 13. His most recent Grammy, best tropical Latin performance
for ''Mambo Birdland,'' came in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank God for giving me the opportunity to know and care for
one of the most amazing men ever to walk the earth,'' said Anthony,
who first performed in Madison Square Garden at Puente's
invitation. He returned the favor in February, inviting Puente onto
his HBO special.
</P>
<P>
   Puente crossed over before anyone coined the expression,
collaborating with traditional jazz artists such as Dizzy Gillespie
and Lionel Hampton. He wrote the song ''Oye Como Va'' years before
it became an enormous rock hit for Santana.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Santana offered his condolences to the family and
said he was thankful to have been able to tell Puente himself how
much his work meant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very honored and grateful to have been touched by Tito
Puente's spirit and his monumental talent,'' Santana said in a
statement he issued from Duisburg, Germany. ''He helped open doors
for me as well as many other musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in Berlin, said Puente was ''more
than a musician -- he was a trailblazer.'' He said Puente's
''countless recordings are classics in the genre he helped
define.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also paid tribute to the late bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   Puente performed with various symphonies, and brought his band
to the White House for Presidents Carter, Reagan and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But he also transcended music to enter pop culture. Bill
Murray's character in ''Stripes'' hailed Puente's musical genius,
as did television's Lisa Simpson. Puente performed the theme song
for ''The Cosby Show,'' and even played himself in the 1992 movie
''Mambo Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Tito's life was like one of his solos -- he got all he could
out of it,'' said Bill Cosby, a friend and a fan, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he received a National Medal of Arts from Clinton -- one
of dozens of honors bestowed on Puente for both his musical prowess
and his ceaseless goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   The inestimable influence of the Harlem-born national treasure
was reflected in tributes offered by a variety of musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tito was for me more than family,'' said Cuban-born singer
Celia Cruz, a long-time friend and collaborator. ''Our world is in
mourning because one of the souls of Latin music has died.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Estefan, in a statement with husband Emilio, praised
Puente as ''a pioneer in the music industry ... an inspiration for
artists and music lovers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tito said to us recently that his music was not only the story
of who he was, but also the pride and the passion of a people
rejoicing in who they are,'' the Estefans said. ''There are no
better words with which to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Anthony Puente Jr. was born April 20, 1923, in Harlem
Hospital, the oldest child of a a factory foreman and his wife.
Initially, Puente was a Fred Astaire-styled dancer; a serious ankle
injury in a bicycle accident refocused his attention on music.
</P>
<P>
   Puente quickly took to percussion, beating rhythms on boxes or
the windowsill and playing his first semi-pro gig at age 13 in a
local club.
</P>
<P>
   The high school dropout was soon playing the timbale with the
Machito Orchestra, a group that had successfully merged the Big
Band sound with a Latin beat.
</P>
<P>
   Puente developed a flamboyant style and convinced the band
leader to move the timbales -- a pair of single-headed drums mounted
on stands and played with sticks -- from the back of the band to the
front.
</P>
<P>
   From his new spot, Puente became the center of attention:
wide-eyed, animated and constantly moving. He reveled in his work
as the consummate showman.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year stint in the Navy during World War II, Puente
took courses at the famed Juilliard School of Music. He then
arranged and worked with other bands until finally debuting his
own, the Tito Puente Orchestra, in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   When the '50s mambo craze swept the states, Puente's fame soared
and he became a regular headliner at the New York Palladium. He
moved to Hollywood in the '60s, working with the biggest Latino
stars: Cruz, Ray Barretto, Mongo Santamaria.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the hard-working Puente became an
international star, taking his band around the world. In 1992, his
100th album -- ''The Mambo King 100th LP'' -- was nominated for a
Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 three-CD career retrospective, ''50 Years of Swing,''
included a cut from his 1946 debut ''El Rey del Mambo'' (''The King
of the Mambo'').
</P>
<P>
   ''The excitement of the rhythms and the beat make people
happy,'' he said in a 1997 Associated Press interview. ''We try to
get our feelings to the people, so they enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente was released May 2 from a San Juan, Puerto Rico, hospital
after two days of treatment for an irregular heartbeat. He canceled
all his events in May, including three concerts planned with the
Symphonic Orchestra of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Puente is survived by his wife, Margie, two sons and a daughter,
said his agent. Memorial services were planned for Sunday and
Monday in Manhattan, with a funeral Tuesday morning in Nanuet.

<HEADLINE> Miracle 82, Sting 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Nykesha Sales scored 24 points and the
Orlando Miracle held off a late charge by the Charlotte Sting to
win their home opener 82-79 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Johnson added 16 points, Adrienne Johnson 14 and Taj
McWilliams 11 for Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte cut Orlando's lead to 80-79 on a layup and foul shot
by Rhonda Mapp with 33.5 seconds remaining. Shannon Johnson was
fouled and hit both free throws for the final margin. Charlotte
Smith's game-tying 3-point attempt was short.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Stinson led Charlotte with 18. Smith added 15 and Mapp 10
for the Sting, who shot 7-of-14 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando led by as many as 13 in the second half, 70-57, at the
9:37 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte got to 76-71 with 2:52 remaining on a 3-pointer by
Smith. The teams traded baskets until Stinson's 3-pointer cut
Orlando's lead to 80-76 with 1:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams' jumper at the 6:19 mark in the first half broke a
25-25 tie as the Miracle went on a 17-6 run to take a 42-31 lead
with 1:47 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte closed with a 6-2 run to trail 44-37 at the half.
Sales led all scorers with 18 first-half points on 6-of-13
shooting.

<HEADLINE> Pawtucket's Ohka Throws Perfect Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) -- Tomo Ohka became the third pitcher in the
117-year history of the International League to throw a nine-inning
perfect game Thursday night as Pawtucket beat Charlotte 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Japanese right-hander needed just 77 pitches --
59 of which were strikes -- to complete the first perfect game in
Pawtucket history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never come close to anything like this,'' Ohka said
through an interpreter. ''But when I realized what was starting to
happen, I concentrated more on trying to win the game for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the game ended, the first thing that went through my mind
was 'I did it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka (5-5) didn't go to as many as three balls on a single
Knights hitter and went to two balls just twice. He had eight
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to keep my emotions under control and to stay calm,''
Ohka said. ''I wasn't overwhelmed by the situation ... I treated it
just like any other game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka was the Boston Red Sox's minor league player of the year
last season, going 8-0 for Class AA Trenton and 7-0 for Pawtucket.
He was 1-2 with a 6.23 ERA in 12 games for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Liu Rodriguez led off the sixth inning with a
grounder just to the right of second base, but David Eckstein
hustled to the ball and threw out Rodriguez by a foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got a lot of outs early in the count and we swung at a lot
of borderline pitches,'' Charlotte's McKay Christensen said. ''He
threw a lot of well-placed fastballs and a tough slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzy Alcantara homered in the fourth, and Pawtucket added a run
in the eighth on a wild pitch.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma St. Leads NCAA Golf  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ZENOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPELIKA, Ala. (AP) -- Oklahoma State junior Charles Howell
couldn't help but wonder if he was in for another second-day slide
in the NCAA Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Howell had nothing to worry about. He shot a
6-under-par 66 to lead the Cowboys to a one-stroke lead over Texas
on Thursday at the midway point of the 72-hole tournament at Grand
National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Howell moved into a first-place tie with Longhorns sophomore
David Gossett at 11-under 133. Gossett followed an NCAA
record-tying 63 with a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Howell had contributed to Oklahoma State's past second-day NCAA
troubles with rounds of 74 and 77 the past two years. The Cowboys,
seeking their ninth NCAA title and first since 1995, had the lead
after the first day both times.
</P>
<P>
   ''That probably cost us the tournament, those morning rounds,''
said Howell, who birdied five holes on the back nine Thursday. ''It
was important for me to play well this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He had plenty of help. Senior Landry Mahan fired a 68 and is at
6 under. Freshman J.C. DeLeon lopped four shots off his first-round
74 as Oklahoma State was 12 under for the day for a 19 under total.
</P>
<P>
   ''Landry's playing great. That's the best he's played all
year,'' Howell said. ''For a freshman (DeLeon) to calm down and
shoot 70, that was huge too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossett, who started out on the 10th hole, began the day with a
double-bogey and bogey and was 2 over after nine holes. The
reigning U.S. Amateur champion recovered with an eagle on the par-5
4th hole followed by two straight birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little sloppy starting off,'' said Gossett, who had a
32 on the last nine holes. ''But I'm proud of myself, the way I
hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was special,'' Texas coach John Fields said. ''The team
got off to a tough start and hung in there and showed a lot of
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven players are within five strokes of the lead. Texas
freshman J.J. Wall had a 71 and is three shots back. East Tennessee
State's Chris Wisler shot 68 and is 9 under. UNLV's Jeremy Anderson
and Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar are at 7 under, one ahead of
Arizona's Ricky Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The team competition is turning into a three-way scramble.
Georgia Tech is at 14 under, eight shots up on fourth-place North
Carolina. Kent is at 5 under and Houston and UNLV are at 3 under.
</P>
<P>
   Texas opened the tournament with a 16-under round and
eight-stroke lead over Georgia Tech. Oklahoma State answered with
the big second round, while Georgia Tech has countered with rounds
of 8 under and 6 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Cowboys) played a real low round today,'' Tech coach
Bruce Heppler said. ''Texas had one yesterday. Maybe we've got one
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The field will be cut to 15 teams and the top nine individuals
after a playoff Friday morning between Wake Forest and defending
champion Georgia. Both are 6 over.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's individual winner, Northwestern's Luke Donald, also
has struggled a bit. He's at 2-under 142.
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 player below par in hot, nearly windless
conditions on the 7,003-yard, par-72 course. By comparison, only
three players were under par at the 36-hole mark last year at
Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The favorable conditions left the trailing teams and players
with hopes for a quick resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this golf course anyone can make a big score and catch a
20-under team,'' said Jason Dufner of nearby Auburn, which made the
cut at 2 over. ''It will be tough to do in two rounds, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has a much less daunting task. Just ask Gossett.
</P>
<P>
   ''A one-shot deficit is nothing,'' he said. ''This is only
halftime.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Andrew Faulds, who displayed an actor's flair as a
member of the House of Commons for three decades, died Wednesday.
He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   His devotion to issues such as the Palestinian cause and his
attack in 1973 on ''Zionists in the Labor Party'' ruled out his
advancement in the Labor Party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   After Rhodesia proclaimed its independence in 1965, Faulds
demanded that white leader Ian Smith be executed. He was also among
the few Labor members of Parliament who spoke out against the
military campaign to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Faulds was elected to Parliament in 1966 and retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking up politics, Faulds had roles in about three dozen
films and played Jet Morgan in the radio adventure series,
''Journey into Space.''
R. Loudon Kelly:
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Longtime newsman R. Loudon Kelly, a 23-year
veteran of The Associated Press, died May 26. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly worked for the Denver Rocky Mountain News during the
1930s, where he was a film critic, crime beat reporter and sports
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Later he worked for the AP in Denver as news editor, and in Salt
Lake City, where he was the bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also is survived by a son and four grandchildren.
Themba Khoza:
</P>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Themba Khoza, a leader of the
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party who allegedly organized deadly
attacks on ANC rivals in the 1990s, died Sunday of AIDS. He was 41.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Khoza -- a member of parliament -- was
awaiting trial on 19 charges, including attempted murder, inciting
violence and gunrunning. The charges stem from attacks on African
National Congress supporters during bloody factional fighting in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people died in the undeclared war between the IFP
and the ANC, which led the struggle against white rule, in the
run-up to South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted murder charges against Khoza stemmed from an
attack on two African National Congress members in 1990 at Ermelo,
east of Johannesburg. He also was implicated in alleged gunrunning
on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 elections, Khoza served in a national committee
that worked toward ending hostilities. He was elected to national
parliament in the 1994 elections and was re-elected in the June
1999 election.
Mary Langston:
</P>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Mary Langston, who for years cooked Elvis
Presley's peanut butter and banana sandwiches, died Tuesday of
complications from a stroke. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Langston cooked for the King of Rock 'n' Roll for 14 years and
continued working for his family for 12 years after he died in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, under her maiden name, Jenkins, Langston wrote a book
about her experiences with Presley called ''Memories Beyond
Graceland Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, she said Presley returned from a concert tour in 1972 and
told her about a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich he had
eaten while on the road. Langston said it took her three tries to
get the sandwich to Presley's satisfaction, and then she cooked
them for him the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Presley died at age 42 of heart disease worsened by drug abuse.
Jack Lloyd:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jack Lloyd, a writer and columnist for The
Philadelphia Inquirer for more than 30 years, died Sunday of a
heart attack. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about pop culture, entertainment, jazz and the Atlantic
City performance scene.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Sinatra released a comeback album in the 1970s, Lloyd
gave it such good reviews that Sinatra, who had a stormy
relationship with the press, asked to meet with him when he visited
the area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two children and a
brother.
Petar Mladenov:
</P>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Petar Mladenov, who served under
Bulgaria's longtime communist strongman Todor Zhivkov and then
helped oust him before becoming president, died Wednesday following
a long illness. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   Mladenov served 18 years as foreign minister under Zhivkov. In
1977 he became a member of the policy-making Politburo.
</P>
<P>
   The end of hard-line communist rule in Bulgaria came in a
Communist Party coup in which reform-minded comrades ousted
Zhivkov.
</P>
<P>
   Mladenov and former Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov helped shape
the reformist group, under the influence of then Soviet-leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's ''perestroika.''
</P>
<P>
   Mladenov became president in November 1989, overseeing the
party's formal break with Stalinism. He resigned in July 1990,
bowing to pressure by the anti-communist opposition after he
allegedly suggested that tanks be used to stop anti-government
demonstrators.
Tito Puente:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tito Puente, the exuberant percussionist and
bandleader who rose to stardom during the mambo craze of the 1950s
and paved the way for Latin musicians from Carlos Santana to Marc
Anthony, died Wednesday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before the current ''Latin explosion,'' Puente -- a
contemporary of Desi Arnaz -- was driving audiences to the dance
floor with his wide-eyed, energetic style and influential sound. He
created his own jazz by blending Latin rhythm with the Big Band
stylings of Tommy Dorsey and Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-decade career that began at age 13, the New York City
native recorded more than 100 albums and won five Grammys. His most
recent Grammy, best tropical Latin performance for ''Mambo
Birdland,'' came in February.
</P>
<P>
   Puente crossed over before anyone coined the expression,
collaborating with jazz artists such as Dizzy Gillespie and Lionel
Hampton. He wrote the song ''Oye Como Va'' years before it became
an enormous rock hit for Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Puente performed with various symphonies and brought his band to
the White House for Presidents Carter, Reagan and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, his 100th album -- ''The Mambo King 100th LP'' -- was
nominated for a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Puente received a National Medal of Arts from President
Clinton.
Jonas Rosenfield:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jonas Rosenfield, former president of the
American Film Marketing Association, died Wednesday. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield helped independent film producers compete with major
studios by developing the American Film Market, a cheaper
alternative to the Cannes Film Festival held in Santa Monica,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the sale of English-language films abroad climbed
steadily under Rosenfield, reaching $1.8 billion in the last fiscal
year before his retirement in 1998.
Johnnie Taylor:
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Soul legend Johnnie Taylor, whose 1976 ''Disco
Lady'' was a hit on the dance floor and on the pop charts, died
Wednesday of an apparent heart attack. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The Crawfordsville, Ark., native was nicknamed the ''Philosopher
of Soul'' by Memphis' Stax Records.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was a protege of Sam Cooke and took over the Soul
Stirrers after Cooke left gospel for rhythm and blues in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Taylor scored his first number one on the R&AMP;B charts
with ''Who's Making Love,'' his first million-seller, followed by a
steady run of other hits. When Stax went bankrupt in 1975, Taylor
signed to Columbia Records and had his biggest commercial success
with ''Disco Lady.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Whales Die After Beaching  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Nearly 80 whales died after beaching
themselves on Mexico's southeastern coast, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 98 whales worked their way onto the shores of a
nature reserve in the Yucatan peninsula on Wednesday, said Ramiro
Rubio, the director of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities launched a rescue effort and were able to bring 22
to deeper waters but 76 died, said Rubio.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were taking samples from the animals and the water to
determine what might have led to the beachings.
</P>
<P>
   This particular species, known as false killer whales, is prone
to beaching itself, Rubio said, who heads the Ria Lagartos
Biosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Officials buried the corpses to prevent any damage their
decomposition might cause to the ecosystem.

<HEADLINE> Fever 57, Sol 54  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Kara Wolters, outplayed for much of the game,
scored six of her eight points in the final six minutes as the
Indiana Fever beat the Miami Sol 57-54 Thursday night in both
teams' opening game of their inaugural seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Fever overcame a 17-point second-half deficit, and Wolters
added a key block in the closing seconds for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana trailed 39-22 early in the second half, but used a 30-11
run to take a 52-50 lead with about two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 Wolters hit two short jumpers, and Rita Williams
followed with a 3-pointer to give the Fever their first lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Wolters added back-to-back baskets with a little
more than a minute remaining to seal the victory. Wolters also
blocked Jameka Jones' baseline runner in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol had a chance to tie with three seconds to play, but
couldn't get off a shot. Miami shot 30 percent and made just eight
baskets in the second half. Indiana shot 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters had been outmatched for much of the game by Miami center
Marlies Askamp, who had 13 points and 10 rebounds and dominated the
lane. Debbie Black, the Sol's scrappy on-court leader, added 13
points and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters was quiet for much of the night as she settled for jump
hooks, badly missing most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   With little help from Wolters and teammate Stephanie McCarty,
the Fever cut into the lead in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the spurt came without forward Jurgita Streimikyte. She
left the game at the 12:17 mark with a sprained right ankle. She
had to be helped off the court after scoring six points.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, she headed to the locker room. She returned with
a splint and crutches.
</P>
<P>
   The Fever didn't score in the final 6:45 of the first half. But
the Sol also struggled to find the basket, missing an opportunity
to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Miami used a 12-2 run to take a 23-12 lead early.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Thompson, who led the Fever with 13 points, hit a jumper
with just under seven minutes to play to cut the lead to 27-20, but
Indiana didn't score again. The Sol's final six first-half points
came from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   They got a lot of help on the boards, too. On four straight
possessions, Miami missed a second free throw, but got the
offensive rebound and converted it into points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol outrebounded the Fever 21-13 in the first half,
including 13-3 on the offensive end. They led 33-20 at the break.

<HEADLINE> 150 Nations Adopt Patent Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A 150-nation conference adopted a treaty on
Thursday to streamline the patenting of inventions and clear an
international tangle of red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The Patent Law Treaty, meant to be a boon to corporations and
individual inventors, is expected to enter into force in about
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Successful completion of the PLT is a major step in the
broader process of reducing patent costs around the world,'' said
Kamil Idris, director-general of the United Nations' World
Intellectual Property Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, adopted by consensus after a final three-week
negotiating round, sets an upper limit on requirements that can be
imposed by a national patent office, said Albert Tramposch, WIPO's
director of industrial property law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does away with overly burdensome requirements,'' said
Tramposch.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually nations will share their judgments of inventions to
certify that the ideas are really new, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Application costs that typically run to tens of thousands of
dollars to patent a single invention in multiple countries would be
slashed, Tramposch said.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is the result of five years of negotiations, and will
be opened for signature by government delegations Friday.

<HEADLINE> Expos 9, Reds 7  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Rondell White and Charlie O'Brien hit two-run
homers Thursday night as the Montreal Expos concluded an
injury-marred trip with a 9-7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal won the first game and the last two on a 3-6 trip that
put a deep gash in its pitching plans. The Expos lost pitchers Matt
Blank, Mike Thurman and Hideki Irabu and catcher Chris Widger to
injuries during the three-city trek.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring only 13 runs during the first seven games on the
trip, the Expos broke out with 10 runs and 16 hits -- matching their
season high -- on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They went one better in the finale, piling up 17 hits off five
Cincinnati pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez (6-1) needed every one of those hits to beat a
team that's troubled him throughout his career. Vazquez had leads
of 8-2 and 9-3, but ended up leaving in the seventh when Dante
Bichette's two-run homer cut it to 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos' depleted bullpen induced two double plays in the last
three innings to hold on. Steve Kline pitched the last two innings
for his second save in three chances.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal wasted a chance to open it up again when Danny Graves
walked the bases loaded in the eighth but Orlando Cabrera grounded
out. It was the only inning in which Montreal failed to get a hit.
</P>
<P>
   White and O'Brien homered off Ron Villone (6-2), who gave up 11
hits and eight runs -- both career highs -- in four-plus innings. The
drubbing ended the best stretch of the left-hander's career -- four
wins without a loss since April 23, a span of six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez came into the game with 2.79 ERA that was fourth-best in
the NL, but once again had big problems against the Reds. The
right-hander was 0-2 in his three previous starts against
Cincinnati, rocked for 16 runs in 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati gave him problems again with a lineup missing Ken
Griffey Jr., who got the day off against his wishes because of an
0-for-14 slump.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker started in center and had three hits, including
an RBI single in the seventh. Bichette's homer cut it to 9-7 and
ended a rough night for Vazquez, who gave up 12 hits and seven
earned runs that raised his ERA to 3.41.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette had three hits off Vazquez, leaving him 6-for-10 career
against him with two homers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was 89 degrees at the first pitch. ... Three Expos have
at least 40 RBIs -- Vladimir Guerrero (45), White (41) and Jose
Vidro (40). The Expos have never had two players get 100 RBIs in
the same season. ... O'Brien was called up May 25 after Widger got
hurt. His homer was his first hit in eight at-bats. ... White is
2-for-11 career off Villone. Both hits were homers. ... A day after
manager Jack McKeon said there was no reason to rest Griffey, he
changed his mind. Griffey is hitting .212. ... Tucker was called
out in the third when he stepped out, got back in the box and then
stepped out again as Vazquez threw. Home plate umpire Marty Foster
called strike three. ... Mark Wohlers pitched one perfect inning
for Class A Dayton in his second rehab appearance, retiring all
three West Michigan batters he faced. He threw seven strikes in
nine pitches.

<HEADLINE> Royals 13, Red Sox 11  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Dave McCarty capped a wild game with his fourth
hit, a two-run triple in the eighth inning, as the Kansas City
Royals had their best offensive game of the season in a 13-11 win
over the Boston Red Sox on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who trailed 8-2 after five innings, rallied with
nine runs in a crazy sixth inning that saw the teams combine for 12
runs, 12 hits and four walks as 22 batters faced 78 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Two runners were thrown out at the plate in the game, Kansas
City's Joe Randa on the back end of a double-steal attempt in the
second and Boston's Jeff Frye on Trot Nixon's double with the score
11-11 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kansas City scored the winning runs off Derek Lowe (2-2).
With Carlos Beltran at first and two outs, Randa singled and
McCarty tripled into the right-center gap.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (5-2) was the beneficiary of the Royals' season
highs of 13 runs and 19 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett had a grand slam, his 17th homer of the season, and
Nomar Garciaparra added a two-run shot, his third, for Boston. Each
drove in four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kansas City batters -- Johnny Damon, Mike Sweeney, Beltran
and Randa had three hits each to go with McCarty's four.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took a 1-0 lead in the third as Rey Sanchez, who
reached on the first of third baseman Wilton Veras' two errors,
scored on a groundout by Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Boston scored six runs as it batted around in the bottom of the
inning. One scored on a sacrifice fly by Veras and another on a
groundout by Trot Nixon before Everett's fifth career grand slam
and first with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City made it 6-2 on two singles and a double-play
grounder by McCarty in the fourth. Boston went ahead 8-2 in the
fifth on Garciaparra's homer after a walk to Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Royals matched their biggest inning of the year, taking
advantage of nine hits and two errors to score nine runs, only five
of them earned, against four pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Singles by Beltran and Randa knocked starter Ramon Martinez out
of the game. Rich Garces allowed singles to McCarty, Gregg Zaun and
Damon that scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Rheal Cormier gave up a two-run double to Jeff Reboulet, then
retired Sweeney on an RBI-groundout and would have escaped the jam
leading 8-7. But Veras booted Jermaine Dye's grounder, sending in
Reboulet with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran and McCarty followed with run-scoring singles and Tim
Wakefield replaced Cormier. Zaun then singled, making the score
11-8, but was out on a rundown.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox tied it in the sixth on Veras' sacrifice fly and
Garciaparra's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reichert pitched two innings for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Boston 3B John Valentin underwent surgery for a ruptured
patellar tendon in his left knee. Dr. David Altchek, the New York
Mets team physician, performed the operation in New York. Valentin
is expected to miss the rest of the season. ... Garciaparra's homer
was his first since April 26 and his first at Fenway Park this
season. He totaled 92 homers the last three years. ... The Royals
scored nine runs in the sixth inning against Toronto on April 6.
... Damon had three hits for the second straight night. ... Tomo
Ohka of Boston's Triple A team in Pawtucket pitched the first
perfect game in club history and the third in the 117-year history
of the International League, beating Charlotte 2-0. He threw 77
pitches.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed In Zimbabwe Unrest  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- An opposition parliamentary candidate
was beaten to death by suspected ruling party activists and a white
farmer fatally shot by unknown assailants in the latest round of
violence ahead of upcoming elections, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Attackers beat to death Thadeus Rukuni, a candidate for the
Movement for Democratic Change, at his home in Bikita, 190 miles
south of Harare, southern Masvingo province police spokesman Steady
Tonde said.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers were suspected members of President Robert
Mugabe's ruling party who forced their way into Rukuni's house
Monday, Tonde said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors reported the attackers chanted revolutionary songs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rukuni was to challenge local ruling party candidate Claudius
Makova, a retired army colonel, in parliament elections scheduled
for June 24-25.
</P>
<P>
   MDC officials said Rukuni's killing -- the first slaying of an
MDC candidate -- was part of a ruling party campaign to intimidate
potential opponents ahead of Saturday's nomination deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Unidentified armed attackers shot and killed farmer Tony Oates
in his house late Wednesday 40 miles northwest of Harare, the
Commercial Farmers Union said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 people have been killed in violence linked to the
election. The labor-backed MDC party is seen as the biggest threat
to the ruling party at the polls since Mugabe led the nation to
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Dow Jones Newswires reported that Zimbabwe's
government has ordered $72 million worth of arms from China.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's army has sent 11,000 soldiers to neighboring Congo to
help President Laurent Kabila fight rebel forces backed by Uganda
and Rwanda. The war reportedly costs Zimbabwe more than $15 million
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Documents obtained by Dow Jones showed an order of military
hardware that included anti-personnel shells, hand grenades, and
ammunition for assault rifles and tanks.

<HEADLINE> LSU Female Athletes Gain Victory  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- In a victory for female athletes seeking
damages from LSU, a panel of federal appeals court judges refused
to reverse their position that the school intentionally denied
female students equal access to athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
initially ruled on the matter in January, then reconsidered the
case in light of new arguments by LSU. But on Thursday, the judges
ruled that those arguments lacked merit to overturn any part of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reopens the possibility for lead plaintiff attorney
Nancy Rafuse of Atlanta to include thousands of present and former
LSU female student-athletes in a class-action lawsuit against
Louisiana's largest public university.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the case does not become a class action, the five
initial plaintiffs still may seek damages, Rafuse said.
</P>
<P>
   The case dates to 1994, when three female soccer players said
the school's refusal to offer them varsity status and the funding
that goes with it violated Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendment
Act.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Doherty ruled that LSU was
not in violation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the lawsuit was expanded to include two softball players
and, while it was pending, LSU added varsity women's soccer and
softball. This time, a judge ordered LSU to submit a plan for Title
IX compliance but ruled the school had not intentionally
discriminated against the female athletes. The judge also denied
class-action status for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, the federal appeals panel reversed that ruling,
saying the discrimination was intentional and that the district
court judge must hold further proceedings on whether the lawsuit
can proceed as a class-action.
</P>
<P>
   In asking the appeals court to reconsider the issue, LSU sought
to prove not only that its actions were not intentional, but also
that the state university was immune from paying damages under
state sovereignty clauses in the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the appeals court said LSU dropped its immunity
when it accepted federal education funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''As best I can tell it's the same end result going back to
district court to decide some more issues,'' Rafuse said. ''I'm
happy to see the court did not need to look at immunity issue.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU athletic department spokesman Herb Vincent said the
university will not comment until its lawyer has an opportunity to
study the opinion.

Court Denies Asylum In Elian Case

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal appeals court sided with the government today and
denied an asylum hearing for Elian Gonzalez -- a ruling that could send the
6-year-old shipwreck survivor back to Cuba with his father within weeks. The
unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of

Court. Family lawyer Kendall Coffey said he hadn't decided on a course of

Gov't Names 12 To Drug Kingpin List
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today put 12 suspected international drug
kingpins on a new U.S. government blacklist aimed at financially isolating
traffickers and their associates. The list contained no surprises. Most, if not
all, of the suspects named were already under indictment. The list consisted of
six Mexicans, a Burmese warlord, a Chinese national operating in Southeast Asia,
two from St. Kitts-Nevis and two from Nigeria. The White House submitted the
list to Congress late today, meeting a June 1 deadline set in a law enacted last
year.

Trial Lawyers Give to Campaigns
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With two major bills to limit lawsuits heading for the
Senate floor, trial lawyers in April contributed $508,000 to Democratic Senate
campaigns. The Houston law firm of Williams Bailey donated $250,000 of the total
raised from trial lawyers in unregulated soft money during April by the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The committee took in $300,000 at a
fund-raiser in Savannah, Ga., during an Association of Trial Lawyers of America
conference. Senate Republicans also are collecting money from special interests
awaiting action on legislation. The railroad industry in April contributed
$185,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

<HEADLINE> Actor Swayze OK After Crash Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) -- A small plane piloted by actor
Patrick Swayze made an emergency landing and clipped a wing on an
empty street in central Arizona on Thursday. Swayze was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze was flying a 1978 twin-engine Cessna 414A from Los
Angeles to Las Vegas, N.M., when he was forced to make an emergency
landing, said John Clabes, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. P.J. Janik, a spokesman for the Prescott Valley police,
said the plane landed on a paved street in a housing development
under construction in this town 90 miles north of Phoenix. As it
landed, the plane hit a light pole and sheared off a four-foot
section of its right wing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze's spokeswoman Annett Wolf in Los Angeles confirmed Swayze
had made an emergency landing and that he was not seriously hurt.
She said Swayze has a home in northern New Mexico, but declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Clabes said Swayze was the only person aboard the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what forced the emergency landing,
but FAA officials had been told it was a pressurization problem.
The FAA lost track of Swayze's plane on radar at 13,000 feet around
11 a.m. and couldn't contact him by radio.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze, 47, has starred in several movies, including ''Ghost,''
a hit that cast him alongside Demi Moore, and ''Dirty Dancing,''
the 1987 movie that made him a star.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Enter S. Leone Battle  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers will not be
dragged into an offensive war in Sierra Leone despite signs the
country's rebels are massing ahead of a pullout of British troops,
a U.N. official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Sierra Leoneans, terrified of a possible rebel attack on
the capital, Freetown, have pleaded for a strong military response
by the international community. So far, the U.N. peacekeeping
mission, known as UNAMSIL, has used force infrequently, and only
when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''UNAMSIL is not going to be involved in the fighting,'' U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst said, but added ''We have no intention of
pulling out if the rebels should advance toward the city. We will
defend the civilian population if they are in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said the beleaguered peacekeeping force was pinning its
hopes on a regional diplomatic initiative to negotiate a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The world body is still recovering from an incident last month
when the rebels took about 500 U.N. personnel hostage, holding them
several weeks before freeing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands
of civilians and intentionally maimed many more during eight years
of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, the RUF abandoned a peace accord signed last July,
seizing the U.N. captives and advancing to within 25 miles of
Freetown. Pro-government forces, with the help of British military
advisers and equipment, have since been pushing the rebels back
from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The government campaign was set back Wednesday when its forces
were driven from Lunsar, some 60 miles east of Freetown, just days
after they captured the strategic town from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Lunsar was in the
hands of the RUF following heavy fighting with the Sierra Leone
army.
</P>
<P>
   The pullout from Lunsar came after a heavy, eight-hour gunbattle
there, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.N. troops shot dead a suspected fuel thief after he
and two others opened fire on the peacekeepers in Freetown's port
overnight, Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Devils Can't Capitalize on Chances  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Randy McKay's frustrated look
summed up the New Jersey Devils' night in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup
finals against the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had plenty of chances to beat Ed Belfour -- maybe even
more than in their 7-3 victory Tuesday night -- but only did it once
Thursday night in a 2-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull scored both goals for the Stars, getting the winner
with 4:16 to play following a New Jersey turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano pushed the puck around defenseman Brian Rafalski and
Hull redirected Jere Lehtinen's fluttering shot past goaltender
Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Devils had at least a half a dozen great chances
to take the lead. No one had more than McKay, one of the heroes of
the Devils' 1995 championship season.
</P>
<P>
   McKay, scoreless in his last 19 playoffs games, had a chance in
close in the second period and mouthed an obscenity when Belfour
stopped the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third, he missed on a close-range deflection
attempt. With 13:20 to play, he failed to convert from 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux also had a couple of great chances, one on a
backhander in close in the opening minute of the third period and
another on a 25-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora, who both scored two goals in Game
1, also had chances on a power play with less than nine minutes to
play, but Belfour stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur only faced three shots in the first period, but one was
a great one by Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Modano won a battle along the boards with Rafalski and sent the
puck back to Hull at the top of the circle. He wristed a bullet of
a shot over Brodeur's glove into the top of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Mogilny tied it at 12:42.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a pass from Scott Stevens, Scott Gomez skated the
puck through the neutral zone with Roman Lyashenko draped all over
him. Approaching the Stars' zone, the rookie center kicked the puck
forward, giving Mogilny a clear path to Belfour, who gave up six
goals on 18 shots in Game 1 before being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny, who had hit the goalpost right after Hull scored,
didn't miss this time, snapping a shot from the inside edge of the
left circle.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs Sign 3 Junior Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs signed goalie Jamie
Hodson, forward Morgan Warren and defenseman Allan Rourke on
Thursday night, beating the midnight deadline to sign major junior
players drafted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If Toronto had not signed the players before the deadline, they
would have re-entered the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Hodson, selected 69th overall in 1998, was 13-22-3 with a 3.36
goals-against average last season for Brandon in the Western Hockey
League. He underwent reconstructive knee surgery last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, drafted 126th overall, had 29 goals and 65 points for
Moncton in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Rourke, drafted
154th, had 31 goals and 43 assists for Kitchener in the Ontario
Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Forced Repatriations Worry U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The United States has expressed concern to
Chinese officials about the forced repatriation of North Korean
refugees, the State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Philip Reeker said the administration supports the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in his opposition to such
repatriations. The UNHCR contends the repatriations are a violation
of international law because the North Koreans face persecution on
their return.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take human rights extremely seriously, and expect all
members of the international community to abide by the guiding
principles of the U.N. Charter as well as the 1951 convention on
refugees and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' Reeker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said estimates of the number of North Koreans who have
fled to China range up to the hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply concerned about the desperate situation many
North Koreans face,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage Grounds Boston Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A power outage caused by a transformer fire
grounded flights at Logan International Airport and caused delays
on public transportation in the Boston area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The airport lost power for almost two hours, airport spokesman
Tom Kinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen incoming flights were canceled and outgoing flights
were delayed, airport spokesman Phil Orlandella said. He said the
entire airport was affected, down to the gates and jet bridges,
though the control tower continued operating on emergency power.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's Blue Line and
the commuter rail north of the city also experienced delays.
</P>
<P>
   The outage was caused by a transformer fire in a suburb north of
Boston, a spokesman for the Chelsea Fire Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison spokesman Mike Monahan said about 13,000
residential and business customers lost power, most in Chelsea and
East Boston, where the airport is located.

<HEADLINE> Thunderstorms Wreak Havoc in Wis.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRON RIDGE, Wis. (AP) -- Thunderstorms packing heavy rain and
strong winds pounded Minnesota and Wisconsin on Thursday, sending
rivers out of their banks and destroying homes in this southeast
Wisconsin community. At least one tornado was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Straight-line winds that struck about 6 p.m. knocked down four
homes and damaged several others in Iron Ridge, Dodge County
Sheriff's Lt. Glenn Welles said.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado touched down in southwest Wisconsin, damaging several
homes in Cataract, and 100 mph winds overturned cars and trucks on
Interstates 90 and 94 near Camp Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   In Gays Mills, near the Iowa border, two dozen families were
evacuated from their homes when the Kickapoo River spilled its
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the streets are blocked off by emergency vehicles, and
crews are getting ready to fill sandbags,'' said Bob Monk of the
Salvation Army of La Crosse, which set up a shelter for the
displaced families. ''It's an eery feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooding along the Pecatonica River shut down a highway bridge
into Darlington, cutting off access to the southwest Wisconsin city
from the south.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just can't get across the river until it goes down,'' said
Deputy Jim Jacobson with the Lafayette County Sheriff's Department
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service reported the Pecatonica River at
15.57 feet in Darlington early Thursday, about 4{ feet above flood
stage. The river was expected to crest at 17 feet early Friday, a
level that could cause major flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Minnesota, up to 5 inches of rain flooded
communities and caused creeks to spill from their banks.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest rain fell late Wednesday and early Thursday near
the Iowa border, with the town of Harmony receiving 5.71 inchesin a
24-hour period, said Pete Boulay, an assistant state climatologist.
</P>
<P>
   In Spring Valley, about 100 miles southeast of Minneapolis,
residents of 25 homes were evacuated as the usually slow-moving
Spring Valley Creek turned into a torrent more than 200 feet wide
in some places.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just like a wall of water that came through,'' said Jim
Cooper, Spring Valley emergency management coordinator. ''It
happened so fast that we were not able to get in and sandbag.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Reimbursement Plan Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A lawyer for Wal-Mart argued Thursday
that Arkansas' plan to pay big chain pharmacies less than small
drug stores for filling Medicaid prescriptions was a blatant move
to curry political favor with the independents.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest retailer is suing its home state to void
implementation of a two-tiered method for reimbursing pharmacies
for providing medicine to Arkansas' poor, elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge G. Thomas Eisele heard the one-day
trial Thursday and said he would rule next week. Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. is not seeking damages.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Human Services, which oversees Medicaid,
implemented its policy April 28 as part of a plan to save $4.5
million from spiraling drug costs. Officials said they also hoped
to minimize losses for small drug stores that provide extras such
as prescription delivery and service to nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart contends the policy is unjustified and discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart lawyer Bill Coston said that a May 1999 memo suggested
the DHS based its plan on politics, not prudence. In the memo, Ray
Hanley, DHS director of Medical Services, suggests to Director Kurt
Knickrehm that a plan that protected independent drug stores might
work politically.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a scheme to rip off the big boys,'' Knickrehm said
during a break in the trial. ''What it protects is the access that
we need to have for Medicaid clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, a $100 billion retail giant, estimates its Medicaid
prescription losses at $1 million annually if the new policy
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a matter of principle, we don't support what they're
doing,'' Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jessica Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could have implications for some poor communities in
the state. Walgreens, which has located some of its 13 Arkansas
stores in lower-income neighborhoods with high Medicaid traffic,
has also filed a lawsuit against the state and threatened to pull
out of the Medicaid program rather than accept a lower
reimbursement.
