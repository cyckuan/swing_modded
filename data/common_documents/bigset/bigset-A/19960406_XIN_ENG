<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today maintained that Iranian pilgrims would hold
political demonstrations during the forthcoming hajj rituals in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said holding the rally during the hajj season "is
not meant to disturb the law and order of the Moslem country of
Saudi Arabia, but to foster better understanding among world
Moslems."
</P>
<P>
"It is part of our fundamental and religiously inalienable
principles," noted the Iranian president in a meeting with high-
ranking clerical officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which will dispatch 78,000 pilgrims to Mecca and Medina
beginning from Sunday, declared Friday that Iranian pilgrims will
stage political demonstrations as "a divine obligation" during
the forthcoming hajj rituals in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian government banned all political activities
during the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
After the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, Iranian pilgrims
insisted on staging political demonstrations and rallies, saying
that the pilgrimage should be used for political aims.
</P>
<P>
A bloody incident occurred in Mecca on July 31, 1987, leaving
thousands of pilgrims killed and injured.
</P>
<P>
Some 320 Iranians were killed in the incident when thousands
of Iranian pilgrims clashed with Saudi police in a political
demonstration near the ground mosque in the holy city of
Mecca.

<HEADLINE> Coup Against Afghan Governor Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The administration of
Nangarhar province in Afghanistan has foiled a coup attempt
against governor Haji Abdul Qadeer Khan and nabbed a gang
comprising 80 armed people belonging to Shari tribe in Jalalabad
today.
</P>
<P>
The Nangarhar shura (council) at an emergency meeting decided
to interrogate the arrested people by a special team.
</P>
<P>
An official of the administration on telephone informed from
Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan that beside modern and heavy
weapons, they also recovered important documents from the arrested
people.
</P>
<P>
A number of letters have been addressed to them by Maulvi
Tarakhel, a known religious scholar supporting the Taliban Islamic
student militia.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that the act could be linked up with
the conspiracies being hatched against Nangarhar governor Haji
Abdul Qadeer Khan and his shura members since long.
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting reports about the affiliation of the
arrested people with other forces and groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nangarhar administration, the arrested
introduced themselves as supporters of the Peshawar-based Afghan
Council for Understanding and National Unity, but the letters
recovered from them were from Maulvi Tarakhel, who was considered
to be an active supporter of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Some sources linked the gang with a powerful member of
Nangarhar shura Commander Hazrat Ali who also belongs to Shari
tribe while another source even associated the arrested people
with the United Nations Mediation Office in Afghanistan headed by
Mehmud Mesteri.
</P>
<P>
The UN is planning to shift its mediation office to Jalalabad
from Pakistan.

<P>
New York, April 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 vehicles of
different types have turned the spacious Javits Center of
Manhattan into an auto city, as the 96th New York International
Auto Show opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The annual auto show of New York was initialized in November
1900, when the horse drawn carriages were still the primary mode
of transport. Now the show has become a staple of New York
citizens, who would throng to the center to see the latest cars
and trucks, to kick the tires and ponder the merits of each
vehicle during this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Japanese car manufacturers have been using the annual
event to compete for bigger market shares by displaying examples
of the latest in transportation technology. But this year, cars
and trucks from Germany and the Republic of Korea are showing a
growing attraction.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the image of the vehicles as simple utilitarian
transport has vanished. Safety, comfort, non-pollution and
multi-functions are what the car makers are striving for. Experts
said that the show has also become an important window through
which people can have a view of high technology and the trend of
the world auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the offerings in sedans have never been "so
stylish, technologically advanced and exciting as they are this
year." They expected to draw about a million visitors and car fans
to the exhibition during the 10-day show.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the vehicles on display, there will be a number
of new games for visitors to enjoy. A three-dimension theater will
bring people all the excitement of the auto industry with
thrilling visual and audio effect. A racing simulator will allow
fans to test their skills in a number of auto and motorcycle
racing.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide access to more people of the globe, many
companies have put their products onto Internet.

JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- From April 7, Israelis will be
able to enter Jordan in their private cars via the Arava border
crossing north of Eilat, Israel Radio said today.
</P>
<P>
A bus route will also operate between the two countries via
the Arava crossing. The ticket will cost 4.5 shekels (1.45 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Israeli cars will be limited to the
southern part of Jordan. Israeli vehicles must also use Jordanian
license plates and purchase special insurances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first flight of Royal Jordanian will land at
Ben-Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
There will be five Royal Jordanian flights weekly from Jordan
to Israel at the present. A round-trip from the Jordanian capital
of Amman to Tel Aviv costs 100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
All these are in accordance with an agreement between Israel
and Jordan on civil aviation and transport signed earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
In six months, the agreement will be examined, and experts
believe that the Hashmite Kingdom may request that the number of
flights be increased.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Say Croats, Muslims Still Holding POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb official today
denied a statement by deputy High Representative for Bosnian
civilian affairs Michael Steiner late Friday that Muslims and
Croats had "apparently met their obligations" by releasing all
remaining prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Dragan Bulajic, president of the Serb State Commission for the
Exchange of Prisoners, said that Bosnian Muslims still held seven
Serbs who had been registered by the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) and that the Croats still held 12 Serbs.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Bulajic told reporters, there were no more
prisoners of war in Serb prisons; only 12 prisoners who had
committed war crimes. Serb parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik
said Friday night that the Serbs had released all prisoners except
the 12 war criminals.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to hand them over with their dossiers to a judge of
the Hague tribunal in Banja Luka later today," Tanjug news agency
quoted Bulajic as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has sent the files of the remaining 12 Bosnian Serb
prisoners to the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
The international community set a deadline of Friday night for
the three parties in Bosnia to release all remaining POWs except
those who have committed war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslims set free 18 Serb prisoners and the Croats
released 28 Serbs Friday night before the deadline passed, but
they are still holding some Serbs who have been registered by the
ICRC, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
After the three parties in Bosnia failed several times to
comply with the Dayton agreement to release all prisoners by
January 19, the international community's High Representative Carl
Bildt conditioned participation at the second donors' conference
in Brussels on April 13-14 with the release of all remaining war
prisoners.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Three Main Purposes in Chirac's Visit to Lebanon (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
left here this afternoon, winding up a three-day state visit to
Lebanon during which, local observers say, he apparently wanted
to achieve three main purposes.
</P>
<P>
The first one is supporting the Middle East peace process and
the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which
calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon,
and seeking a French role in the future post-peace security
arrangements between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The second purpose is stressing traditional, "rooted" relations
between France and Lebanon and France's support for Lebanon's
ambitious reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
The third one is calling for the participation of all the
Lebanese people in the next parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's visit to Lebanon was his first official visit to an
Arab country in the Middle East, and was also the first visit by a
French president to Lebanon since it gained independence from a
French mandate in 1943. Chirac was also the first Western
president to have visited Lebanon since the end of the 1975-1990
civil war in this country.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chirac repeatedly stressed France's support
for the Middle East peace process, envisaging that the year of
1996 would be "a decisive year, and a year for conclusion of peace
agreements between Lebanon and Israel, and between Syria and
Israel."
</P>
<P>
He said that only through peace negotiations could foreign
occupation be removed and the conflict in south Lebanon be ended.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also met with the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
Commander, Major General Stanislaw Franciszek Wozniak, and
inspected some positions of the multi-national forces, especially
those of the French contingent. He expressed the hope that Lebanon
would extend its sovereignty to all its lands, and that the
peoples in the region, including the Israelis, could live in peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that France had paid a tax of blood for a restoration
of peace in this region, stressing that his country was ready to
participate in the peace "if all the parties want it to do that."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on the last day of his visit, Chirac
clearly stated that France was "ready to help Lebanon guarantee
the security on its borders" following the withdrawal of the
Israeli troops and the deployment of the Lebanese security forces
on all the Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
He said that a main topic of his talks with Lebanese leaders
was "to consolidate the bilateral relations in various fields."
</P>
<P>
He also said France is willing to play a role in the Middle
East region "through Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The French president and Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri presided over a ceremony for signing a protocol on
French financial aid to Lebanon, which amounts to 500 million
French Francs, in support of Lebanon's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also met with Maronite Cardinal Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir,
the spiritual leader of Lebanon's Maronite Christian community.
</P>
<P>
Chirac announced that they talked about the next parliamentary
elections in Lebanon, which will be held in October. He said that
he stressed to Cardinal Sfeir the necessity for the Lebanese
Christians to participate in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France hoped that the next elections in Lebanon
would be a chance for all the Lebanese to participate in the
authority, and a way for them to realize internal peace in this
country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Lebanese Christian oppositions boycotted the
parliamentary elections in 1992, on the grounds that no just
election could be held in this country when there were still
foreign forces on its lands.
</P>
<P>
Intensive contacts are being held presently between all the
parties in Lebanon in a bid to map out an election law acceptable
for all the religious sects and political groups.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that, in view of a close relation
between France and the Lebanese Christians, Chirac's visit to
Lebanon could reduce the possibility of another boycott by the
Christians against the next elections.
</P>
<P>
The observers also maintain that during the visit, France has
clearly expressed its willingness to consolidate the relations
with Lebanon and expand its influence in this region through
Lebanon, willingness which could be regarded by the United States
and Syria as a threat to their interests.

OTTAWA -- A gunman, suspected to be the estranged husband of
one of his victims, shot dead nine people and wounded two others
before killing himself on Friday in one of Canada's worst multiple
shootings, police said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred as a family prepared for a wedding
ceremony in a house in the middle-class Mission Hill district of
Vernon, 300 miles northeast of Vancouver in Canada's British
Columbia Province. The bride and her sister, who was estranged
from the gunman, were among the dead. The groom was on his way to

Security Council (NSC) here today in response to the DPRK's
announcement of giving up its duties to maintain the Demilitarized

</P>
<P>
Kim said that the recent moves by the DPRK represented "a
deliberate act of provocation that, unlike any provocative moves

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Investigating Iran Arms Sale to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Republican-controlled
Congress has launched investigations to determine whether
President Bill Clinton secretly approved Iranian arms shipments to
Bosnia despite a United Nations arms embargo against the Balkan
nation during its bloody civil war, Congress sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The investigation came after Los Angeles Times Friday published
a report alleging that the Clinton administration secretly gave a
green light to covert Iranian arms shipments into Bosnia in 1994
while pledging to uphold the U.N. embargo policy and urging U.S.
European allies to isolate Tehran globally as a supporter of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Four U.S. House committees are probing the matter, and Senate
Majority Leader and likely Republican presidential candidate Bob
Dole has ordered four Senate panels to do the same, the sources
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dole said on Friday that the Los Angeles Time's report is "very
disturbing news."
</P>
<P>
The report raised questions about whether the administration
was "intentionally duplicitous in their dealing with the Congress"
and whether laws were violated in the conduct of covert
intelligence operations, Dole said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said through a spokesman that the
president's policy on the Bosnian weapons deliveries "may have
resulted in Iran's terrorist regime for the first time gaining a
major foothold in Europe."
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials confirmed that Clinton was aware of
the Iranian arms shipments.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that the policy did not amount to a "green
light" for Iran to arms the Bosnian Muslem-led government.

here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Petr Korda and Daniel Vacek, who were nominated just before the

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iranian Hardliners Wage New Attacks on Liberals (II) (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conservative Iranian parliament is now investigating the
Tehran Municipality.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the English daily "Iran News" published
Thursday, Mohsen Kouhkan, a member of the investigating team, said
the team had "identified many discrepancies (at the municipality)
such as lack of implementation of law, unlawful fees collected,
unlawful (financial) aids granted and unnecessary excesses."
</P>
<P>
Conservative members of parliament said that despite lack of
cooperation from the municipality the reports would come out,
which they said would have "political consequences for senior
officials of the municipality."
</P>
<P>
Corruption in the government is an issue that most Tehran
residents talk about when they are taking the buss. The talks are
open and people do not mind getting heard.
</P>
<P>
Even pro-Rafsanjani newspapers openly write about the rampant
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Bahman, a liberal weekly run by Deputy President for Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs Ataullah Mohajerani, reported in its latest
issue that between March 21, 1995 and March 20, 1996, Iranian
courts handled cases involving about half a billion U.S. dollars
of embezzled money.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's administration is also attacked for not taking
sufficient measures to control the runaway inflation.
</P>
<P>
Hamshahri, a Persian daily published by the municipality,
reported today, quoting the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), that
between March 21, 1995 and February 20, 1996 the rate of
inflation in the urban areas reached 50.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, economists reject CBI's report, saying that actual
inflation is about 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is also criticized for being anti-clerical even
though Rafsanjani himself is a clergy and for being too soft on
the United states.
</P>
<P>
A student leader said that if "the government was more
revolutionary, more aggressive, the U.S. would not dare put any
pressure on Iran."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iranian Hardliners Wage New Attacks on Liberals (I) (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian hardliners waged a new
round of attacks against the administration headed by moderate
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani, 62, and his government have come under
attacks in recent days for corruption, inflation and for being
anti-clerical and soft on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Today's headlines in the local dailies reflected statements by
hardline Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati who attacked the government
during a Friday prayer, saying that the officials squandered the
public money.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the New Year's address by Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei was also a cloaked attack on the Rafsanjani
administration for its excesses.
</P>
<P>
In his address delivered on March 20 (Iranian New Year's Eve),
Khamenei said that officials "were duty-bound not to squander" the
resources of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Following Supreme Leader Khamenei's line, hardline Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri also lost no chance to attack
Rafsanjani's government for corruption.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here noted that the conservative camp headed
by Nateq-Nouri has clearly adopted a new strategy by attacking the
moderate camp headed by Rafsanjani with two clear purposes.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the hardliners try to prevent President Rafsanjani
from getting the third term of presidency though the Constitution
allows only two consecutive terms of presidency.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, they want to defeat Rafsanjani's close aide and
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who is believed to be a
very hopeful candidate for the presidential elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that with 14 months left to the
presidential elections in 1997, Rafsanjani's liberal faction is
coming under increasing attacks for corruption among the
officials.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, Iran's political center, rumors are spreading that
Rafsanjani's family is involved in the importation of Daewoo cars
from South Korea and controls exports of dry-fruit pistachio.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Hashemi Rafsanjani, the oldest son of President
Rafsanjani, had to publicly rejected the widespread rumors. He
also denied that his family was ever involved in the importation
of electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The attacks on Rafsanjani or his top aides by the
conservative hardliners are to destroy the president's image and
weaken the liberal camp," a political analyst said.
</P>
<P>
He added that since Rafsanjani cannot run for a third
consecutive term, the hardline politicians were aiming at
weakening Rafsanjani's top aides such as Tehran Mayor
Karbaschi.

<HEADLINE> 800-year-old Imperial Tombs Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Twelve imperial tombs from the Jin
Dynasty (1115-1234) have been discovered in Acheng City in the
northermost China province of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Acheng was the site of the first capital of the Jin dynasty,
and was a political center for 38 years before the Jin moved the
capital to the present-day Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Four out of a total of nine emperors used Acheng as the seat of
their empire, but no imperial tombs had ever been found until the
early 1990s when archaeologists identified the tomb of the first
emperor and his son.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, scholars have discovered 11 other
imperial tombs scattered in six townships in the city.
</P>
<P>
Stone figures of humans and animals, and altars were placed in
front of the tombs. Researchers say that some of the imperial
tombs have an underground palace, which is probably the only part
that has not been demaged.

OTTAWA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A gunman, suspected to be the
estranged husband of one of his victims, shot dead nine people and
wounded two others before killing himself on Friday in one of
Canada's worst multiple shootings, police said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Orders "Iron Clad" Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 6 (Xinhua) -- President Kim Young-sam has ordered
South Korean troops to maintain "an iron-clad defense posture"
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Kim gave the order at an emergency meeting of the National
Security Council (NSC) here today in response to the DPRK's
announcement of giving up its duties to maintain the Demilitarized
Zone.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that the recent moves by the DPRK represented "a
deliberate act of provocation that, unlike any provocative moves
in the past, stem from North Korea (DPRK)'s elaborate and
long-term scheme."
</P>
<P>
This was the third time that the president has convened an
emergency NSC meeting in accordance with the South Korean
constitution.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, the DPRK announced in a statement that it is
"giving up its duty to maintain" the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that
divides the DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
It accused South Korea of ignoring the 1953 armistice agreement
by bringing tanks, artillery and heavy weapons into the DMZ,
deploying a large number of armed military personnel there and
building large military facilities in the zone.
</P>
<P>
This had turned the DMZ into an "armed zone and a new attack
position for the invasion of the north," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has made us no longer unilaterally observe
articles of the armistice agreement concerning DMZ," said the
statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 1953 armistice agreement prohibits the introduction of
firearms other than revolvers into the joint security area.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK also said its troops and vehicles entering the joint
security area of Panmunjom and the DMZ will no longer bear
identification insignia.
</P>
<P>
It said that these actions were necessary because there have
been flagrant violations of the 43-year-old armistice agreement
that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War.

<HEADLINE> 3,000-year-old Fertility Symbol Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A carving representing male
reproductive organs dating back some 3,000 years has been found in
the Three Gorges area in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The carving, made of soft black stone, shows the fertility
worship of the people at that time and is among the rarest of the
relics in a country where people are traditionally not so open
about sex, according to Chinese archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
The sculpture was found on Zhongbao Islet, which is now part of
the dam foundation in the Three Gorges area on the middle reaches
of the Yangtze River, the largest water conservation project in
China ever.
</P>
<P>
Also discovered on the island were pillar holes and other
man-made objects from about 6,000 years ago, an elephant tooth
from the same period, 23 pits containing thousands of pieces of
pottery, jade and stoneware, and remains from the Xia (21th-16th
Century BC) and Shang (16th-11th Century BC) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The items are part of the tens of thousands of cultural relics
that have been unearthed in the dam area.
</P>
<P>
The relics include pottery, porcelain, stone, jade, bronze and
ironware from the Xia, Shang, Zhou (11th Century-221 BC), Qin
(221-206 BC), Han (206 BC-220 AD), Song (960-1279), Yuan
(1271-1368), Ming (1368-1644), and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, some 50 archaeologists from 10
provinces have taken part in excavation work at 24 historical
sites in the dam area, which are located on the two sides of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
At the Yangjiawan site, scholars excavated neolithic remains
that will contribute to the study of the ancient environment of
the Three Gorges area and layouts of early residential areas.
</P>
<P>
Also found at the site was a piece of pottery with an
inscription regarded as a valuable clue to the origin and
development of Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Some pottery jars discovered at the Baimiao site have filled in
blank spots in archeological charts of the late Neolithic Age,
while a lot of relics found in the dam area, which date from the
Zhou Dynasty (11th century BC-221 BC) to the Qin-Han Dynasties
(221 BC-AD 220), may help give a true picture of the culture
developed by the Ba and Chu peoples living in the area before the
Bronze Age, according to scholars.
</P>
<P>
They disclosed that their next task would be to excavate
cultural relics in areas far from the dam but which will also be
submerged after the reservior is completed.

MOGADISHU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A spontaneous ceasefire seem
holding in south Mogadishu today after two-day fighting between
the rival militiamen of Osman Hassan Ali Atto and those of
General Mohamed Farah Aidid.

Early in the morning, heavy shellings of fighting were heard

The general has apparently left Baidoa, 340 km southwest of
Mogadishu, for a new option to settle the dispute between his
militiamen and those of Osman Atto.
</P>
<P>
It is not known what the option will be, a massive militia
attack or a political solution for the crises which seems to be
weakening the power militia of the Habar Gidir clan both of whom
General Aidid and Osman Atto belong to.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed the General was prompted by increasing
pressure from many parts of Somalia including the international
community.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 battle wagons were in the company of General
Aidid last night when he arrived after more than 8 months of
absence from the capital. The General was also accompanied by
hundreds of heavily armed militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The two-day fighting in south Mogadishu between followers of
Osman Atto and The General has claimed the lives of more than 25
people, wounding more than 60 others.
</P>
<P>
Other armed clashes have also erupted between the supporters
of General Aidid and those of Ali Mahdi Mohamed living in Medina
district near Mogadishu's International Airport last night.
</P>
<P>
The clashes which continued for more than an hour did not make
any of the warring sides gain any territory. However, both sides
have sustained undisclosed casualties. Mogadishu international
airport was not functioning since the departure of the
international community from Somalia in early March last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Mr Hussein Haji Bood, said
his faction, the United Somali Congress of Somali Salvation
Alliance (USC/SSA), will not remain quiet about the fighting
which continues between Osman Atto's men and those of General
Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The clashes at the airport last night corresponded to the
wishes of USC/SSA to support Osman Atto's men in their conflict
with their arch rival General Aidid. However, few people are
optimistic about the realization of USC/SSA's words.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union delegation was caught at the
middle of a cross fire between the supporters of General Aidid
and those of General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan in Kismayo
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The shootout began when the Deputy President of General Aidid,
Mr Mohamed Haji Aden and General Morgan quarrelled over the
hosting authority of the European delegation in Kismayo.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen of General Morgan have managed to suppress
those of Mr Aden and managed to let the delegation tour the city
and its main hospital run by the MSF-Belgium.
</P>
<P>
However, the clashes have once again resumed at the airport
during the departure of the delegation. But none of the
delegation was hurt.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for General Morgan, Mr Abullahi Ali Guled,
accused General Aidid's deputy president of masterminding a plot
to kidnap the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Mr Guled furthermore said Mr Aden's men were fulfilling orders
from their superiors in south Mogadishu who rejected the
delegation to visit south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Mr Aden who is also from the same clan family of General
Morgan, Mejerten, was in Kismayo since September last year.
</P>
<P>
The delegation which has been visiting Somalia for two days
has submitted to the Somali local authorities the European
Union's budget allocated for Somalia for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The sum will be 60.6 million U.S. Dollars for developing
livestock, education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, water,
sanitation and institutional buildings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- More than two million people in
the Chinese capital participated in the 12th annual national
tree-planting day, today.
</P>
<P>
Local citizens and soldiers planted more than one million
trees, pruned another four million, and cleaned five million sq m
of green space.
</P>
<P>
An enthusiastic atmosphere of those digging in the earth,
moving saplings, watering trees, fertilizing the soil, and pruning
twigs pervaded the metropolis all day.
</P>
<P>
Groups of students from the city's universities and members of
ethnic communities planted trees marking ethnic unity among
different nationalities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Making Beijing greener has been at the top of the list of
efforts of the municipal government for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
This was exemplified by the fact that each year more than one
million people joined the tree-planting effort, bringing to 36.26
percent the tree coverage in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Per capita green space now stands at 7.08 sq m in the Chinese
capital, according to official statistics, and the figure
is expected to reach eight sq m by the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Austria Aids Uganda's Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian government has
granted 118,000 U.S. Dollars to the Uganda judiciary in a bid to
help the East African country in reproduction of publication of
laws.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Ministry of Justice said here today
that the money was received on Wednesday and it was transferred
from Vienna to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The money, the source said, was used to start the third phase'
of reproduction of the publication of the laws of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The laws of Uganda which are reproduced include statutes
and statutory instruments from 1965 to 1993, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Justice Benjamin Odoki was quoted as saying that the
judiciary aims to reproduce the laws for the years
because they have not been easily available to the courts in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Odoki said the laws of the country had not been revised since
1964 and that the lack of publication has made them scarce to
circulate to institutions which needed them, including the
general public.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem was brought about by the problems the
country went through in the past 30 years.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here today

<P>
Li, saying he was very glad to meet with Belarussian Foreign

said to him "You and Foreign Minister Qian have held very good
talks, our two sides have frequent contacts, and continued
exchanges of high-level visit, which helped strengthen bilateral
ties."
</P>
<P>
Li said that Belarus has a very good foundation for science and
technology and has plenty talented people, and that he believes its
national economy will have sound development.
</P>
<P>
As an independent and sovereign state, Belarus has the right to
chose its own pathway and decide what it should do, Li pointed
out, noting that this is understood and respected by the Chinese
side.
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to strengthen economic and trade
cooperation with Belarus, and to develop direct trade ties. The
Chinese side are satisfied with current Sino-Belarussian relations
and their cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Senko thanked Li for the meeting, and conveyed the sincere
wishes and greetings of Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko
and Premier Mikhail Chigiry.
</P>
<P>
"We highly value the meeting with foreign minister Qian Qichen,
which is both significant and beneficial," Senko said. The
atmosphere for Minsk-Beijing political ties is very good, he
noted, adding that President Lukashenko's visit to China, and
Premier Li Peng's visit to Belarus last year gave great impetus to
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 20 agreements signed by the two sides
provide a foundation in law for bilateral cooperation. "We should
in the future spare no effort to develop the economic and trade
ties," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also thanked China for its support of
Belarus on some international issues.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Jobless Rate in 5 Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To cope with the problem, the ministry has decided to work on
comprehensive measures with both urban and rural factors being
considered.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong said that urban jobless pressures will ease only
after the number of migrant rural laborers is reduced, so job
opportunities in the countryside are crucial.
</P>
<P>
The measures proposed at the conference include:
</P>
<P>
-- central government departments and local governments
implement the system of sharing responsibilities for the jobless
problem in reform measures;
</P>
<P>
-- the "re-employment project," which has already proven
effective in providing jobs for the out-of-work and long-time
unemployed will be be expanded nationwide, and more funds will be
invested and the re-employment training will be increased;
</P>
<P>
-- an "organized and orderly migration of rural surplus
laborers" program will be introduced, and rural laborers will be
restricted from entering major cities where the jobless problem is
relatively serious; and
</P>
<P>
-- the jobless insurance system will cover all laborers at an
earlier date.

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Jobless Rate in 5 Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Labor Ministry said today
that the country is developing a series of measures to create more
jobs and to hold the rising urban jobless rate to 3.2 percent this
year, and 4 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Rural surplus laborers will be encouraged to stay where they
are, so that the number on migrants will be held at around 30
million this year, and 40 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The statements came at a national conference on employment here
today, attended by central government personnel and labor
officials.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Li Boyong cited unemployment as a global issue
the concern of every government. For populous China, he noted, it
has always been a serious problem, and will become even more so in
the future.
</P>
<P>
"Because of its close links with social stability, economic
reforms and national development, the major issue of unemployment
must be addressed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those at the conference decided that government at various
levels should increase the number of jobs to 41.5 million in the
next five years, up from the 38 million created by the demand of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed will be held to 8.5 million, and the
jobless rate to around 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, China created 36.36 million jobs for
urban residents, and the urban jobless rate was below 3 percent,
according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The worsening job situation will mainly be caused by a rapid
rise in the number of new laborers in the next several years, and
by redundant workers in state-owned enterprises and an increase in
the number of rural surplus laborers. Jobs created by economic
growth will hardly meet the demand for work.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry estimates that the number of unemployed both
in urban and rural areas along with the redundant and surplus
laborers could reach 153 million in the year 2000, if nothing is
done about it.
</P>
<P>
That number will be the country's highest since 1980, according
to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> hke --- Faulty Aids Test Affects 20,000 in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) - About 20,000 people in Britain who
were cleared of having the HIV virus in the past six months will
have to be retested because the test used was found to be faulty,
the government said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health confirmed that a "small proportion" of
people who are HIV positive were falsely given negative results in
the test, which is commonly used in British laboratories to test
blood samples for the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus which can lead
to Aids.
</P>
<P>
The problem was discovered last week by the test manufacturer,
Chicago-based drug company Abbott Laboratories Inc. which sent
letters to British laboratories, telling them to stop using the
test.
</P>
<P>
Abbott spokesman Mat Kuhn said in Chicago on Friday: "We
suspended distribution on March 25 and took action following a
small number of reports of inaccurate results. We voluntarily
informed all our customers and government health authorities
throughout Europe."
</P>
<P>
"This is going to cause a lot of anxiety and expense," a
British consultant said. "We don't know who is going to pay."
</P>
<P>
The number of people who may be HIV positive in the repeat
tests will be small. About 40,000 people a year ask to be tested
for HIV in England and Wales and the positive rate is 1.3
percent.

GUANGZHOU, China, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Bin scored his second
in the last minute to pace the Guangdong Hongyuan club for a 3-2
win against Thai Farmers Bank in an international soccer friendly
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Farmers Bank, Asian club champions in 1995, netted the
first off a corner kick in a goal-mouth melee which caught the
home audience aghast before half break.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai footballers that lost to Yokohama Flugels of
Japan in the inaugural Asian Super Cup final last year, were
overrun by the home squad when Li Bin and Chi Minhua found the net
twice in the 63rd and 75th minutes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, the Thai team scored the equaliser before Li
Bin slammed home the winner for Hongyuan one minute before the
final whistle.
</P>
<P>
The Thai team has won the national titles annually since 1991
while Hongyuan only ranked fourth in the Chinese professional
league last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin, outlining
his re-election platform, vowed today to continue economic and
political reforms and keep Russia unified.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of his supporters from across the country,
Yeltsin stressed that he has the strength and the will to win the
presidential election scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to complete the economic reform program by the
year 2000, adding that it will be followed by natural economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
He promised to take further concrete steps in the social sphere
to safeguard citizens' interests, particularly those of retirees
and the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
The president said government officials would be made to work
more effectively, the number of personnel in state bodies had to
be cut and the fight against corruption intensified.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin again pledged to push forward the stalled peace process
in the breakaway Republic of Chechnya, where fighting has
continued despite Yeltsin's ceasefire decree.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow had proposed negotiations between the federal
authorities and Chechen rebels, even including separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev, through mediators.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent troops into Chechnya in December 1994 to quash
Chechen separatists' drive for independence. The war has lasted
for 17 months and Yeltsin himself has admitted it is an obstacle
to his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 delegates from every region of the country attended
the meeting of the All-Russia Movement for the Election of
Yeltsin, which is led by Sergei Filatov, Yeltsin's former chief of
staff.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng's Visit to France "Extremely Important" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit to France by
Chinese Premier Li Peng is "extremely important" and a "major
event" in France-China relations, according to French ambassador
Francois Marcel Plaisant.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Xinhua, Plaisant noted that
development of Sino-French relations was revived by a joint
communique on January 12, 1994. Then, in April of that year,
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid a visit to China and
in September, Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited France.
</P>
<P>
Li's first visit to France is yet another important event in the
course of continued progress of France-China relations, he added,
saying that this visit is made more important by the fact that
France has a new president, Jacques Chirac, who himself attaches
great importance to Asia, and China in particular.
</P>
<P>
Developing relations with China and Asia will be a great theme
during the new president's seven-year tenure in office, Plaisant
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Li's visit to France is of prime political significance
judging from the strategic aspect -- both France and China are
permanent members of the UN Security Council, both have nuclear
weapons, and both are influential in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jiang Zemin, in his meeting with French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in February, stressed the
importance of handling Sino-French relations with strategic
foresight. This was also reflected in talks between President
Chirac and Premier Li at the recent Asia-Europe Meeting in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic and trade relations between the two
countries, he said that, according to French statistics, bilateral
trade was 30.2 billion French francs in 1993, 34.7 billion in
1994, and 39.1 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, France, the world's fourth trade giant, has only a 1.7
percent share of the Chinese market, Plaisant said, noting that
"there is much to be done."
</P>
<P>
French enterprises have shown interest in China and rank second
among members of the European Union in terms of investment in
China, the ambassador said, adding that he hopes cooperation in
space and other high-tech fields can be increased.
</P>
<P>
As a veteran diplomat with 36 years' experience, Plaisant
arrived in Beijing to take the ambassadorial post just a week
before the two countries signed the January 12 communique. He
said he was glad to be an eyewitness to the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the potential of this document will continue to
be unleashed in future cooperation in all fields including
politics, economy and culture," said Plaisant.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the upcoming visit to France by Premier Li Peng will
mark a new and effective step toward this direction," the
ambassador added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Plays Model Role in Region: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's financial business
is playing a model role in the Asia-Pacific region, according to a
World Bank report.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report for a forthcoming conference of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be hosted in
Hong Kong in 1997, the World Bank said that the experience of Hong
Kong provides an interesting example of how, in a relatively free
market economy, concerted public policy actions can effectively
facilitate capital market development.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Hong Kong has allowed the
internationalization of its currency and permitted foreigners to
issue bonds in Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's substantial infrastructure needs will spur the bond
market, as will the need to finance China's growth, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As a regional financial center, Hong Kong is well positioned to
intermediate in bonds for the East Asia region, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been rewarded for its
achievements with the hotly sought-after right to host the
conference of the World Bank and IMF in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to draw 10,000 participants,
including 3,000 officials delegates, 1,000 guests and observers,
3,000 visitors, 1,000 World Bank and IMF staff and 2,000 media
representatives, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also underline Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The largest power plant in
Phnom Penh with a capacity of 18.6 megawatts a year was
inaugurated today to ease the power shortages hampering the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The current capacity of power stations in Phnom Penh is 73
megawatts which is inadequate to meet the capital's demand for
electricity, Industrial Minister Pou Sothirak said at the
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The new power station was built at a cost of 14 million
U.S. dollars with a loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that a 10 megawatt power plant financed by

HELSINKI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Contacts between Finnish and
Chinese government leaders will help promote their countries'
trade and economic cooperation, Finnish Minister of European
Affairs Ole Norrback said today.
</P>
<P>
He said during an interview with Xinhua that China's
highly-developed economy, together with the traditionally healthy
trade relations between the two countries, has laid a firm
foundation for their further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Norrback, who will accompany Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari
on a visit to China on April 15, stressed that the exchange of
visits by leaders of the two countries demonstrated their
intention to strengthen friendship and to help expand cooperation
between Finnish and Chinese enterprises.

Norrback said he was satisfied with the development of
bilateral trade, which, he said, is in line with Finland's
interests.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that different views still exist between China
and Finland on some issues, but he said the differences should not
hinder their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Finland and China enjoy broad prospects for trade and economic
cooperation, especially in telecommunications, forestry and
environmental protection, Norrback said.
</P>
<P>
He said Finland gives full backing to the European Union's plan
to expand cooperation with China.

<HEADLINE> Dumping at Lantau Causes HK Environmentalists' Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Dumping by construction
companies has spoiled a 100 meter-stretch of coastline on south
Lantau, Eastern Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's largest island, Lantau is noted for its
beautiful scenes and coastline to travelers.
</P>
<P>
The dumping which began last year has destroyed a coastal strip
 at Shui Hau, south Lantau, leaving only one tree standing along a
 100-meter shoreline.
</P>
<P>
The dumping has caused environmentalists' concern and they sent
 men to photo the spoiled scenes and the number of the trucks
involved in the dumping.
</P>
<P>
Green Lantau Association is urging reinstatement of the land
and prosecution of those responsible for the dumping.
</P>
<P>
But a land officer of the Islands District said that most of
the dumped area on Lantau was privately owned and there was little
 the government could do, unless the offender was caught
red-handed.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that an investigation into the dumping will be
 made, but reinstatement of the land would depend on resources,
which were limited.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was likely the villagers had planned the
dumping to level off the land.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leaders and high-ranking
officials participated in tree-planting activity in east Beijing's
Chaoyang Park today, which is the country's 15th annual national
tree-planting day.
</P>
<P>
Having planted a lacebark pine, President Jiang Zemin said that
although China has made remarkable progress in the past few years,
its green coverage is still lagging behind that in those countries
outstanding in term of greening space.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that people will continue to go all out
for nationwide afforestation in an effort to beautify the country.
</P>
<P>
Beside him is Premier Li Peng. He called on people to further
increase their "sense of greening".
</P>
<P>
Other senior Chinese officials and officials of Beijing
municipality also participated in the tree-planting in the park,

<HEADLINE> Iran Tries to Head Off Israeli Move in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today vowed to boost its relations with Arab countries
despite Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres' latest challenge by
visiting Iran's two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities got very nervous about Peres' visit to
Omen and Qatar. The Foreign Ministry even called in two
ambassadors to voice their angry.
</P>
<P>
To face severe challenge, Rafsanjani said in a meeting with a
visiting Kuwaiti minister that Iran is for consolidation of ties
with the neighboring Moslem and Arab countries, including Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president explained that was "not because of
financial benefits but for the sake of Islamic and spiritual
interests."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Rafsanjani's statement indicates Iran
was insistent on fighting back against Israeli influence in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned this week's visit by Shimon
Peres to Qatar and Oman, the two countries considered to be
friendly towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Jassem Mohammad al-Aoun, Kuwaiti Minister of
Communications, Electricity and Water, Rafsanjani termed Iran a
good friend and ally for the Persian Gulf countries, adding that
the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoys very high potentials for the
economic flourishment of the region.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Iran's efforts for expanding political, economic
and cultural cooperation with its neighbors, he said, Iran's
participation in technical and economic projects of the region
will cut the cost of these projects drastically and thus reduce
expenditures of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Al-Aoun termed the outcome of his talks with Iranian political
and economic officials as positive saying that Kuwait is
interested in broader cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait supported Iraq in its war against Iran (1980-88). But
Iran declared its opposition against Iraqi occupation of Kuwaiti
territory.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Kuwait have maintained friendly relations since the
end of the Gulf War, providing opportunity for high-ranking
officials to meet and discuss ways for expansion of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to local paper, the Iranian Foreign Ministry told
the two Arabian ambassadors that "the officials, people and
circles of [Arab] countries and especially the Persian Gulf
countries" would have to be doubly sensitive to the Israeli
influence in the area.
</P>
<P>
A source here noted that Iranian government is watching
Israeli moves in the region and is trying to preempt their moves
by giving advance notice to countries that are getting close to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the officials in Yemen are told to reconsider
hosting Peres," he said.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Yemen and Bahrain were the other two
countries in the region that were planning to invite Peres.
</P>
<P>
The latest military agreement between Turkey and Israel has
worried Iran as well. The news of the contract signed between
Ankara and Tel Aviv received prominent coverage in today's
Iranian dailies.
</P>
<P>
A commentary aired today on the state-owned Tehran Radio
criticized Ankara for signing a contract "which was in favor
Israel and to the detriment of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
It said that the contract was "unique" because there was no
other agreement like it.
</P>
<P>
The commentary predicted that the agreement will further create
a rift between the members of the burgeoning Islamic movement in
Turkey "who want to be in line with the Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
Another commentary published in today's Resalat, a Persian
daily published here, attacked Turkey as "the platform of
conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
It criticized Turkey for trying to appease Israel, warning
that "the ingratiation by Ankara makes the old enemy of the
Muslims closer to the sacred Islamic frontiers."

<HEADLINE> Bigwig's Arrival Heralds Ceasefire in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A spontaneous ceasefire seem
holding in south Mogadishu today after two-day fighting between
the rival militiamen of Osman Hassan Ali Atto and those of
General Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, heavy shellings of fighting were heard
in some parts of the city, but the thunderous noise of the heavy
rounds and small gunfire ceased at about 7:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Some politicians attribute the immediate spontaneous ceasefire
to the arrival of General Mohamed Farah Aidid in Mogadishu in mid
night last night.
</P>
<P>
The general has apparently left Baidoa, 340 km southwest of
Mogadishu, for a new option to settle the dispute between his
militiamen and those of Osman Atto.
</P>
<P>
It is not known what the option will be, a massive militia
attack or a political solution for the crises which seems to be
weakening the power militia of the Habar Gidir clan both of whom
General Aidid and Osman Atto belong to.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed the General was prompted by increasing
pressure from many parts of Somalia including the international
community.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 battle wagons were in the company of General
Aidid last night when he arrived after more than 8 months of
absence from the capital. The General was also accompanied by
hundreds of heavily armed militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The two-day fighting in south Mogadishu between followers of
Osman Atto and The General has claimed the lives of more than 25
people, wounding more than 60 others.
</P>
<P>
Other armed clashes have also erupted between the supporters
of General Aidid and those of Ali Mahdi Mohamed living in Medina
district near Mogadishu's International Airport last night.
</P>
<P>
The clashes which continued for more than an hour did not make
any of the warring sides gain any territory. However, both sides
have sustained undisclosed casualties. Mogadishu international
airport was not functioning since the departure of the
international community from Somalia in early March last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Mr Hussein Haji Bood, said
his faction, the United Somali Congress of Somali Salvation
Alliance (USC/SSA), will not remain quiet about the fighting
which continues between Osman Atto's men and those of General
Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The clashes at the airport last night corresponded to the
wishes of USC/SSA to support Osman Atto's men in their conflict
with their arch rival General Aidid. However, few people are
optimistic about the realization of USC/SSA's words.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union delegation was caught at the
middle of a cross fire between the supporters of General Aidid
and those of General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan in Kismayo
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The shootout began when the Deputy President of General Aidid,
Mr Mohamed Haji Aden and General Morgan quarrelled over the
hosting authority of the European delegation in Kismayo.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen of General Morgan have managed to suppress
those of Mr Aden and managed to let the delegation tour the city
and its main hospital run by the MSF-Belgium.
</P>
<P>
However, the clashes have once again resumed at the airport
during the departure of the delegation. But none of the
delegation was hurt.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for General Morgan, Mr Abullahi Ali Guled,
accused General Aidid's deputy president of masterminding a plot
to kidnap the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Mr Guled furthermore said Mr Aden's men were fulfilling orders
from their superiors in south Mogadishu who rejected the
delegation to visit south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Mr Aden who is also from the same clan family of General
Morgan, Mejerten, was in Kismayo since September last year.
</P>
<P>
The delegation which has been visiting Somalia for two days
has submitted to the Somali local authorities the European
Union's budget allocated for Somalia for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The sum will be 60.6 million U.S. Dollars for developing
livestock, education, health, infrastructure, agriculture, water,
sanitation and institutional buildings.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Phasing Out Indian Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign collaborators in India's
joint ventures in the consumer durable goods sector are gradually
phasing out the Indian partners and taking full managerial control
of the companies, industry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
After getting the Indian government approval for a majority
stake of at most 51 percent in a joint venture, most of the
foreign collaborators are trying to set up 100 percent owned
Indian subsidiaries. They have applied to the government for
fresh approval for an 100 percent owned subsidiary, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the important reasons for this trend in joint ventures
is the inability of Indian partners in matching the financial
muscles of their foreign collaborators in injecting funds, a
senior representative of a multinational company said.
</P>
<P>
As the foreign companies are coming in with technology, funds
and most importantly, the brand, sooner or later they would be
dictating their terms to most Indian partners in the case of joint
ventures, the industry sources said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Build more Low-cost Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Building Society
(ZBS) will this year spend more than 60 million U.S. Dollars on
the construction of low-cost houses countrywide, according to a
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Demand for low-income houses has been on the increase with
more than 65,000 people currently on the ZBS waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization has also made the housing situation worse, the
society Managing Director Francis Nhema said.
</P>
<P>
He added his building society would this year concentrate
mainly on the construction of low-cost units to cater for people
who are in dire need of houses.
</P>
<P>
Nhema said the crisis has seen the establishment of squatter
camps in and around Harare and in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Living conditions have been worsened by the rains which have
damaged the structures put up by desperate people. Some caught
fire resulting in the loss of lives and property, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, to help alleviate the crisis, ZBS has embarked on
construction projects countrywide which are now at various stages
of development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees High Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, the most populous country
in Africa has registered a rapid growth of population
particularly in the urban centers which is said to be at an
embarrassing level.
</P>
<P>
Third Eye newspaper today quoted Nigeria's Minister of State
for Works and Housing, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, as saying the rate
of urban population growth was about 6.5 percent, compared with
the annual growth rate of 3 percent for all developing countries
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, urban population accounted for only
14 percent of the national total in 1960, and only two cities had
more than half a million residents each.
</P>
<P>
By 1980, he said, 20 percent of the population lived in urban
centers and nine cities had more than 500,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Urban population became 34 percent of the country's total a
decade later and by the year 2000, the figure is expected to
reach 43 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the minister said, there were in cities
inadequate shelter, potable water supply, safe means of waste
disposal and other medical services.

<HEADLINE> PTF To Invest Heavily in Road Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) of
Nigeria will pump some 3.76 billion U.S. Dollars into the
rehabilitation of 12,000 km of highways and urban roads in the
country, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
A contract to this effect was signed between PTF and 25 road
construction companies in the capital of Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's road network consists of about 32,000 km of federal
highways, 30,000 km of state roads and 60,000 km of local
government roads.
</P>
<P>
Most of them were built during the country's oil boom in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
But with increased wear and tear, dwindling oil revenue and
lack of a sustained maintenance culture, the highways and roads
network continued to deteriorate over the years, said PTF
Executive Chairman, Major-General Mohammadu Buhari.
</P>
<P>
The state of the road network which has been the cause of
highway accidents, increased vehicle maintenance cost accompanied
by soaring transport cost, will continue to worsen "at an ever
faster rate" if no immediate and effective measures are taken, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The official did not mention when the projects, widely
regarded as the largest single one so far undertaken by PTF,
would start, but said the main aim is to open up passage for
timely delivery of agricultural inputs and products for export.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for Unity of Lebanon's Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac,
before winding up his state visit to Lebanon, called on here today
all the Lebanese political and religious parties to unite for
Lebanon's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held this morning in the Beirut
Presidential Palace, Chirac also called on the Lebanese outside
this country to unite for an existence of their country.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, the French president held meetings
with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and
Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri. He made an address to the
Lebanese 128-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also had talks with Maronite Cardinal Nasrallah Butros
Sfeir, the spiritual leader of Lebanon's Maronite Christian
community, on the upcoming parliamentary elections in Lebanon and
a participation of all the Christians in it.
</P>
<P>
Most of Lebanon's Christian opposition parties boycotted the
previous elections in 1992, on the ground that there could not be
a just election in Lebanon with the presence of foreign troops on
its land.
</P>
<P>
In addition to some 1,000 Israeli troops occupying an buffer
enclave in South Lebanon, there are 35,000-strong Syrian forces in
west Lebanon and in the capital city of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Stressing a national unity of Lebanon, Chirac said that France
hoped that the next parliamentary elections in Lebanon would be an
occasion for a participation of all the Lebanese in the authority
and a way to set up the internal peace in this country.
</P>
<P>
Chirac underlined that a just election law should be adopted,
allowing a representation of all the parties.
</P>
<P>
He underlined France's desire to liberate the Lebanese
occupied lands and its readiness to participate in an peace
agreement (between Lebanon and Israel).
</P>
<P>
The French president also stressed his country's support for
the peace process, especially the U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed France's readiness to help Lebanon guarantee the
security on all the borders after a withdrawal of Israeli forces
and a deployment of the Lebanese security forces.
</P>
<P>
The French president is scheduled to leave Beirut around 4:00
pm (13:00 GMT) for Cairo to continue his tour in this region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived in the Lebanese capital on Thursday
afternoon on the first leg of his Middle East trip, is the first
Western president to visit Lebanon since the end of Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is also the first French president to visit Lebanon
since this country gained its independence in 1943 from a French
mandate.
</P>
<P>
During Chirac's visit, the two countries signed a protocol
on French financial aids to Lebanon which amount to 500 million
French francs (100 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Closure Drives Palestinians into Corner (by huai chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli closure of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank has caused a devastating impact on the
Palestinian economy and a prolonging of the closure could have
disastrous ramifications on the Palestinian autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Both private and public sectors have been completely paralyzed
as a result of the closures of the borders between Israel and the
Palestinian territories. The closure began six weeks ago after a
series of suicide bomb attacks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. During
the first two weeks, Israel also prohibited Palestinian residents
from traveling between major towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
The economy is losing 10 million dollars (the daily gross
domestic product of Palestine) every day and the unemployment rate
has reached 80 percent according to Muhammad Shtayeh, Director
General of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and
Reconstruction (PECDAR).
</P>
<P>
Palestinian industry has been severely damaged by the closure
because of the reduced mobility of factory workers and a sharp
decline in the availability of raw materials. Restriction of free
movement between villages and cities has created an incredible
effect on factories. The inability of large number of workers to
reach their work locations has greatly decreased the productivity
of the factories, which have also faced difficulties in marketing
their products due to the travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Atef Alawneh, Palestinian Deputy Minister of Finance, said
most factories have suffered severe shortage raw materials. A
number of factories were forced to close down and the workers
were sent home because their reserves of raw materials have
completely been used up.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has also been badly affected. "This sector has
suffered huge losses," Alawneh said. "Large quantities of
agricultural produce have been wasted due to the inability of
farmers to harvest their crops in time. The farmers cannot even
market the crops that they already harvested. In addition, the
farmers are not able to get necessary agricultural supplies, such
as fertilizer, vaccines for agricultural diseases and seeds."
</P>
<P>
During the period of internal closure, trade between towns and
villages was as a matter of fact paralyzed, resulting in a
fragmentation of the Palestinian market. This in turn led to
decreased prices due to product surplus in some areas, such as in
the Gaza Strip and the northern West Bank, and increased prices
due to unavailability of goods in the central and southern areas
of the West Bank. As a result, tens of thousands of farmers in
the Gaza Strip, the Jordan valley and certain areas of the West
bank, who depend on this season's profits for their financial
solvency, have gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Government institutions have also suffered a lot from the
closure. the inability of workers to travel has reduced the
ability of the institutions to provide Palestinians with public
services. An example is the problems that the Finance Ministry is
currently experiencing.
</P>
<P>
The cessation of the Ministry's work and the decline in general
economic activity has resulted in a reduction in the Ministry's
budget. "The inability of Ministry workers to travel to their
offices has affected the collection of taxes and fees. The loss of
this revenue and decline in normal economic and commercial
activity has deprived the Treasury of essential resources,"
delcared Alawneh. "The situation creates a huge decline in the
budget, which will, in turn, limit the ability of the government
to fulfill its public obligations and to finance basic services to
residents, such as the payment of educational and health dues."
</P>
<P>
This budget deficit will prevent the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) from providing relief to those families who are
most affected by the closure. Many Palestinian families are on
the brink of starvation. The PNA, the only source of relief for
these families, is finding it increasingly more difficult to
provide the necessary aid because of the huge drop in its
resources.
</P>
<P>
PECDAR, the PNA institution that coordinates international aid
relief and economic infrastructure development, has also been
greatly affected by closure. Most of its projects have been
stopped, resulting in huge business losses for the contractors
with whom it was working.
</P>
<P>
According to Shtayeh, international aid agencies are also
experiencing losses due to the closure. "For instance, EU
projects worth millions of dollars have been stopped because
workers and engineers are unable to reach their work
locations. Most of the projects in Hebron and the Gaza district
have been stopped because of the area closure. No one knows for
how long this situation will continue."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mining Sector to Grow by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining sector is
expected to grow by 10 percent this year against the background
of firm world prices, while manufacturing growth should improve
by 8 percent, the zimbabwe central bank has said.
</P>

mining companies continued to increase as shown by recent
licences awarded by the government.
</P>
<P>
The bank said statistics showed last year the value of mineral
production rose by 44 percent to more than 610 million U.S.
Dollars, with gold output accounting for 40 percent of the total
value.

<HEADLINE> Body Formed to Co-ordinate Tourism in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Local and foreign tour
operators in Tanzania have formed a council to look into their
internal differences and chart out strategies to face kenya in a
major quest for equitable benefit and market share.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from Arusha, northern
Tanzania today, Prof. Karim Hirji, a tourism consultant based
here, was unanimously peaked as interim chairman by a meeting of
hoteliers, hunters, airline operators, tour and travel agents
there on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Karim told reporters that Tanzanian tourism was
currently seen as an appendage of kenyan tour packages and the
operators wanted the situation reversed before thinking of
cooperation on a regional scale.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by the principal secretary in
the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Mrs. Rose Lugembe,
who proved to be more than handy in building a bridge between the
major but antagonistic local and foreign tourism players.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyans have recently been pressuring Tanzania to re-open
the Bolongoja gate which bursts straight into the heartland and
splendour of the Serengeti and the Ngorongoro Crater reducing the
Maasi-Mara into a safari anti-climax. The gate was closed in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
All tourists from Kenya have to pass through the Namanga
border post at present, a move that benefits most hotels in the
country's northern circuit rather than they came in via
Bolongoja.

<HEADLINE> UN Accepts Sign Language for Deaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Deaf people could now
attend international meetings and conferences without facing
communication barrier with their hearing following the U.N.
acceptance of a sign language as an official one of the deaf.
</P>
<P>
Regional director of the eastern and southern Africa
secretariat (rsesa) of the World Federation for the Deaf (WFD),
Mr. Dominic Ouma Majiwa, told reporters in Dodoma, central
Tanzania on Friday that the UN had also endorsed the use of sign
language interpreters during such meetings and conferences.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Majiwa said in the past the deaf had been going through
the most critical problem of living in total isolation for lack
of information, sign language interpreters in Africa as most
governments and associations for the deaf either experienced
financial constraints or ignored the training of such personnel.
</P>
<P>
If more interpreters were trained, he said, most of them would
have been absorbed into serving the deaf in areas such as
hospitals, courts of law and the universities.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Majiwa urged the deaf to have their own sign language
based on their culture and the way their communities
communicated.
</P>
<P>
"That is why i have come here with my interpreter as i was
using my Kenyan sign language which is a bit different from that
used in Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WFD official urged governments to take initiative of
assisting local associations for the deaf in training their
interpreters and solving their socio-economic problems.

LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Home Affairs Minister
Chitalu Sampa has warned that stern measures should be taken

</P>
<P>
If the constitution amendment bill would be passed at

Two clauses in the proposed amendment bill will ban Kaunda
from contesting the presidency because Kaunda, whose father is
not a Zambian citizen, has already served two terms of office.

<HEADLINE> Indian Cabinet Okays Talks on Su-30 Aircraft Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian cabinet has
authorised the defence ministry to negotiate with Russia for the
purchase of a squadron of sukhoi-30 aircraft worth about 600
million US dollars, the official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
At its meeting here friday the cabinet cleared the defence
ministry's proposal to buy Russian su-30 fighters. A fortnight
ago, the cabinet okayed defence ministry's proposal to buy 10
mirage-2000-5 aircraft from France.
</P>
<P>
The su-30 is a long range interceptor capable of flying deep
into the enemy territory on bombing and interceptor missions while
the mirage-2000-5 is a short range multi-role fighter. The latter
can be used as a short range ground attack aircraft as also in
low-flying interceptor roles.
</P>
<P>
The Indian air force needs long range interceptors as well as
short range multi-role fighters. The su-30 and mirage-2000- 5 will
fulfil this requirement for at least the next decade, the same
sources said.

<HEADLINE> PNG Welcomes More Malaysian Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Papua New Guinea
(PNG) Prime Minister Julius Chan today expressed the hoped for
more Malaysian investments in his country, said Malaysia's Bernama
news agency.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Sibu, Sarawak, concluding his six-day
official visit, Chan said he expected Malaysian investments to
reach 2 billion US dollars by the end of the century from about
500 million US dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's investments in the PNG in the past eight
years had probably surpassed those of any other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chan urged Malaysian businessmen to diversify their
investments, which are now mainly in the forestry sector, into
communication, construction and finance sectors.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a ministerial-level committee be set up
between Malaysia and the PNG and meet at least annually to tackle
economic problems, especially on the guarantee of investment.
</P>
<P>
"I will try to make sure that what have been agreed with
investors in the PNG will be maintained and guaranteed," Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope for sending more people from the PNG
to be trained in Malaysia, especially in the national development
planning and in the forestry sector.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Champion Lost in China Table Tennis Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- World top chop-attack player Ding
Song, who helped China regain the team title at the world
championships in northern Chinese city Tianjin last year, lost to
Xiong Ke in a match of the China table tennis series here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, ranked 29th in the world, dominated the game with fast
attacks and top-spin play, beating the 11th-ranked Ding 21-12,
21-18.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Ding, who routed Sweden's former world singles
champion Jorgen Persson in the men's team final and then ended the
singles run of world top player Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium in
the Tianjin Worlds, failed to unleash his various spins as Xiong
often hit the ball at the middle of the table.
</P>
<P>
Ding had jumped to a 8-4 lead in the second set with
close-to-table attacks, but Xiong clawed back to clinch the match
with loop drives and deceptive serves.
</P>
<P>
In the women's match, world number four Liu Wei edged out
youngster Gong Yuechun 21-19, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Liu, world mixed doubles champion playing in
handshake style, depended on her experience to move her penholding
rival off balance and never hesitated on the crucial points.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attacks Israeli Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched this morning an attack at an
Israeli position in the Israeli-occupied buffer zone in South
Lebanon, breaking the calm in the area which had notably lasted
for several days.
</P>
<P>
The militant Hezbollah, which spearheads a guerrilla warfare
against the Israeli occupation in South Lebanon, announced in a
statement that one group of its fighters carried out the attack
at the Israeli position at Souida at 7:10 am (4:10 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It said that the guerrillas used machine guns and rockets in
the attack, destroying a base for launching Taw rockets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an artillery unit of the Shiite Fundamentalist
Party shelled the same position with "suitable weapons," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that the morning attack broke the calm
which had been covering South Lebanon since earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the two confronting sides refrained from
taking any provocative move on the last Arab-Israeli battlefront
in the past few days in order to make a tranquil atmosphere for a
current historic visit by French President Jacques Chirac in
Lebanon as well as in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in Beirut on Thursday afternoon on the first
leg of his tour in Middle East, where he will also visit Egypt
and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
One of prominent activities within Chirac's agenda in Lebanon
was a visit on Friday afternoon to the headquarters of the
multi-national peacekeeping force in South Lebanon at the
southern Lebanese coastal town of Naqura.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also inspected some positions of the U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, especially those of the French Contingent.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was the first Western president going most southward to
an area only several kilometers north of the Lebanese-Israeli
border.

Malaysian ringgit (about 6.38 US dollars) per kilogram, slightly
lower than 16 ringgit (about 6.4 US dollars) last week.
</P>

An absence of demand prompted narrow range trading throughout
the week with the market in weak note. Turnover declined to 494
tons this week from 945 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and the London Metal Exchange
widened to 50 dollars per ton Friday from 35 dollars per ton
previously.

as a result of slower regional markets. The market was not traded

(about 1.49 US dollars) per kilogram compared with 383 sen (about

Meanwhile the Malaysian CPO physicals wrapped up the week
higher on speculative buying in anticipation that the market will
be bullish next week.

<P>
The market extended its gains for two consecutive days till

there would be overseas interest in the market soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- World record holder in the women's
100-meter backstroke He Cihong gave up the 200m backstroke heats
competition at the China National Champion's Tourney here on
Saturday due to illness.
</P>
<P>
He, who shattered the world mark with 1:00.16 at Rome World
Championships two years ago, didn't perform well in her speciality
on Wednesday, clocking in a modest 1:02.98, 2.82 seconds slower
than her own best time. She had to settle for the silver, behind
Chen Yan, a teenager from Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
She had been expected to save some fame in the 200m backstroke.
She was the Asian record holder of the 200m event.
</P>
<P>
"She got a fever last night," said Zhou Ming, one of the vice
head coach of Chinese national team. "She will not participate
in tonight's final."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether He's withdrawal will affect her Olympic
qualification, Zhou answered with much caution, "Before the
official announcement of the Olympic line-up to Atlanta, I could
say nothing about that."
</P>
<P>
However, Zhou revealed that the possibility of keeping He out
of the Olympic squad would be "minuscule."
</P>
<P>
A group engaged in selecting the swimmers for the Atlanta
Olympics has been set up and the final list will be announced
soon after the Tianjin tournament.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lin, coach of He, said that the long-time lack of major
competitions was the main cause to He's failure.
</P>
<P>
He Cihong will go to Bangkok for the upcoming Asian Swimming
Championships, which starts on April 12.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Russia to Buy More Thai Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok has asked Moscow to import
more Thai goods in a bid to bring down Thailand's high trade
deficit with Russia, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Thep Devakula, permanent secretary of the Thai Foreign
Ministry, made the request in a meeting with visiting Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Panov who arrived here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current trade deficit with Russia stands at 800
million US dollars, with Russian sales to Thailand amounting to
1.2 billion US dollars and Thai exports to Russia 400 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thep urged Russia to buy more Thai computer hardware, furniture
and electrical equipment, saying that their prices are highly
competitive on the world market.

<HEADLINE> Newsprint Price Falls in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Newsprint Producers
and the Union of Newspaper Publishers have agreed to lower the
price of newsprint by 7.7 percent for deliveries during the
April-June period, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The lower price was made possible by a larger supply of old
newspapers on the international market, according to a release by
the Association of Indonesian Pulp and Paper Producers.
</P>
<P>
Old newspapers are imported as raw materials for producing
newspapers in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Prices of old newspapers make up 60 percent of the cost of the
newsprint production, while the remaining 40 percent consists of
other operational costs such as electricity, labor and bank
interest payments.
</P>
<P>
The heavily fluctuating costs have led to a quarterly, instead
of a yearly, fix of the newsprint prices in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The country currently has to import 2.2 million tons of old
newspapers a year for the production of newsprint and industrial
paper, while the domestic market can provide only 800,000 tons of
raw material.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Cautious About US Threat on Copyright (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is urged to
beef up its crackdown on infringements of intellectual property
rights as the United States has threatened to put it back on the
priority watch-list of retaliatory action.
</P>
<P>
A committee on international economic cooperation chaired by
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan Friday urged the
government to pass laws to ensure a watertight protection of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The government should not soften its suppression of patent
violations, although the country has been removed from the
priority watch-list to the ordinary watch-list since November 18,
1994, Amnuay said.
</P>
<P>
However, the US said in a trade estimate report issued on
Monday that Thailand's measures to protect intellectual property
are far behind international standards.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of Thailand's patent law is not sufficiently
effective and US firms usually have to pay patent registration
fees six to seven times higher than what they pay in the US, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also claimed that Thailand had failed to safeguard
materials protected by US copyright statues as agreed under the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Thai Commerce Ministry said some US
private companies had asked Washington to restore Thailand to the
priority list and accused Thailand of having problems in enforcing
patent laws, including inefficient protection of audio-visual
works.
</P>
<P>
The American businessmen wanted to put Thailand on the priority
list with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Krirk-krai Jirapaet, director-general of the Business Economic
Department under the Thai Commerce Ministry, said the US was not
justified to place Thailand back on the priority list as the
country has improved its copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has presented to the US details of its progress in
intellectual protection and planned measures to clear trade
barriers for US products.
</P>
<P>
Washington will reportedly announce its classification list of
countries under Section 301 of its Trade Act within the next 24
days.

<HEADLINE> 30 Indian Firms Penalized for Substandard Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Commerce Ministry has
suspended or canceled the licenses of over 30 exporters as a
penalty for exporting substandard goods, sources from the
ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also decided to impose deterrent penalty and
fiscal penalty on the exporters who tarnish the country's image by
exporting poor quality goods.
</P>
<P>
Stringent penalties have been imposed in six cases in the last
two months, including those related to two Mumbai-based firms
which were found to have exported substandard medicines to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The exporter-importer code numbers of two Kerala-based firms
were canceled after they were found to have exported poor quality
biscuits to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The above firms have been barred from export-import activity.
</P>
<P>
A heavy penalty was imposed on a Calcutta-based company that
was found to have exported inferior quality tea to Russia while
another company was debarred from exporting goods or obtaining
export licenses for three years.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government has given extra benefits of
special import licenses to exporters holding 1SO 9000 and BIS
14000 certification to reward quality exports as part of the
recent amendments to the country's 1992-97 export import policy.

<HEADLINE> Voters Face Crisis of Confidence: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The electorate does not credit
any of the political leaders with national status, said a study
conducted over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The disturbing political developments during this period in the
country have led to the voters facing a "crisis of confidence" in
their leadership.
</P>
<P>
The electorate has very little to choose between Prime Minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders L.K. Advani
and A.B. Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The absence of a charismatic leader has also resulted in
negative voting and preference for new and unknown faces, the
study further said.
</P>
<P>
Urban voters have shown their preference for a leadership which
breaks the old system and is more open and transparent in its work
and conduct in public.
</P>
<P>
For the rural electorate, a clean personality and nationalist
leadership concerned with welfare of the poor matter more.
</P>
<P>
For women, young and energetic leadership has a higher appeal,
the study said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- In its draft election manifesto,
India's biggest opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), promises to have a smaller government and a clean public
life.
</P>
<P>
There will be a severe cut-back on bureaucracy. In addition,
the manifesto promises sweeping changes in the country's judicial,
constitutional and administrative structure to ensure a clean
public life.
</P>
<P>
Free-market operations for growth will be promoted and programs
for poverty eradication and social infrastructure accentuated, the
BJP manifesto further says.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment will be encouraged for world class
technology, quality upgradation and identification of overseas
markets. The party's strategy favors an export-led growth based
primarily on a higher level of domestic savings and investment and
development of the requisite human skills.
</P>
<P>
The BJP in its draft manifesto promises to confine the public
sector only to sensitive areas where the nation's security is
involved and to areas where it is necessary to provide a
moderating or counter-poising role to the ill-effects, if any, of
an unchecked private sector. The BJP will constitute a
disinvestment commission for taking care of disinvestment from the
country's public sector.

<HEADLINE> Goal Set for Iron, Steel Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's iron and steel sector
should produce 96 million tons of rolled steel to meet 95 percent
of the amount demanded for the country's economic construction
through the turn of this century, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
That was announced by Liang Cai, an official from the Ministry
of Metallurgical Industry, who presented a report Friday outlining
China's development strategy for the iron and steel industry in
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, Liang said, more than 90 percent
of China's rolled steel should reach the international quality
standard and one-third of such products should achieve the quality
level achieved by the world's main steel producers, such as Japan
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the year 2000 China's iron and steel sector
should be capable of providing all the high-quality rolled steel
needed for auto making, all the steel plates for large-sized ships
and all the special steel products used in power generating
equipment and railways.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more than 80 percent of the thin steel
plates needed in auto making, 70 percent of the steel pipes for
oil drilling and exploitation and 70 percent of all stainless
rolled steel should be produced by domestic steel enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China has 38 iron and steel plants each with a steel production
capacity of 500,000 tons and 22 enterprises each with a steel
production capacity of one million tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China produced 94 million tons of steel,
representing an annual growth of 6.5 percent in the 1990-95
period.
</P>
<P>
When developing over the next five years, Liang said, China's
iron and steel sector should concentrate on quality and variety
rather than quantity.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's wood-based industry is
facing a shortage of raw materials, according to official sources
here.
</P>
<P>
The demand for timber in the country is estimated at 41.2
million cubic meters a year but forest concessionaires can produce
only 33.9 million cubic meters a year, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Reforestation and Land Rehabilitation
Hendarsun Suryanda Sanusiputra recently proposed that forests
managed by indigenous people should provide the remaining 7.3
million cubic meters to offset the shortage.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the indigenous people to play a bigger role
in the development of the wood-based industry in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The forests managed by the indigenous people, which are found
in 26 provinces in the country, cover a total area of 776,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The sources said technical problems and red tape are hindering
the development of Indonesia's industrial timber estates.
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging the participation of local people
in forestry projects, which call for the conservation of forests
as well as opening new business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia now has 144 million hectares of forest land, of which
30 million hectares have been declared protected forests and 19
million hectares are natural reserves and national parks.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the forest land consists of limited production
forests, regular production forests and convertible forests.

JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police have sounded an
alarm over the widespread trafficking of Ecstasy, a stimulant drug
that has gained great popularity among young Indonesians, the

<P>
Chief detective of the National Police Force, Brig. Gen.

</P>
<P>
Roesdihardjo said the laws on dangerous drugs are now outdated
because they do not cover the trafficking and use of new drugs
like Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Jakarta police seized several types of 6,315
Ecstasy pills from a Dutch national.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's head detective, Col. Adang Rismanto,
the police had kept a close watch in the past few months on the
Dutch man, who is a "shrewd" Ecstasy dealer.
</P>
<P>
The police are still investigating whether the man is part of
an international drug trafficking syndicate.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Propargite Banned From Using on Apples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The chemical propargite is banned
from using on apples and nine other fruits and vegetables because
of high cancer risk, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said that new studies showed the propargite, a widely
used pesticide in the U.S., posed "unacceptable risk" of cancer to
people who eat fruits and vegetables treated with the chemical.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which is part of an agreement between the EPA and
Uniroyal Chemical Co., the chemical's only producer, also covers
apricots, peaches, pears, plums, figs, cranberries, strawberries,
green beans and lima beans.
</P>
<P>
The chemical is used on 19 percent of the apple acreage
nationwide. In New york and Michigan, about half of apple trees
are treated with propargite.
</P>
<P>
The EPA estimated that the move should tremendously reduce the
danger of propargite.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Tritan Shehu was elected today
Chairman of the ruling Democratic Party of Albania at the party's
third national convention which was opened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Shehu, 46, a former minister of health and environmental
protection, replaced Eduard Selami who was ousted in March last
year due to different political views.
</P>
<P>
The two-day convention was held in preparation for the
forthcoming parliamentary election. The Democratic Party won the
1992 parliamentary election only two years after its establishment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, President Sali Berisha, also
a leading figure of the Democratic Party, said the party has
achieved great successes in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
He said the inflation rate dropped from 400 percent in 1992 to
6 percent now, and foreign debts were reduced from 200 percent of
its GDP of 1992 to below 10 percent of GDP today.
</P>
<P>
Albania was the only East European country which enjoyed a
two-digit growth rate, the president added.

<HEADLINE> Suzhou River to Add Tourist Site to Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou River, which has long
been known as filthy, stinking, and black sore on the Shanghai
landscape, has caused people to be very concerned about some
improvement measures.
</P>
<P>
As a means of remedying the situation, the China's largest
economic center has decided to try everything to improve the
river, which flows through the downtown area, with the idea of
turning it into a resort river for tourists by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Lu Shuping, director of the municipal environmental protection
bureau, told Xinhua today that the work will be done in three
phases:
</P>
<P>
-- In the next two years, trees and grass be planted along the
banks of the river;
</P>
<P>
-- By the year 2000, polluting sources will be eliminated, and;
</P>
<P>
-- By 2010, there will be a complete rehabilitation of the
river, making it into a tourist river.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the city decided to curb its air
pollution by checking auto exhaust.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city now has 470,000 motor vehicles,
which produce large amounts of exhaust each day, harming people's
health and degrading the urban environment.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the municipal government is working on a massive
gas-purifying effort for 100,000 vehicles producing excessive
amounts of exhaust this year.
</P>
<P>
The department is also considering charging special fees for
exhaust, and developing a system of fines for vehicles producing
too much exhaust gas, Lu added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Advocates "Voluntary Participation" in  CIS Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia stands for the principle of
"voluntary participation" and "mutual benefit" in the process of
integration of the CIS states, President Boris Yeltsin said today.
</P>
<P>
"The disintegration of the Soviet Union dealt a blow to many
people, and so we should develop cooperation and build our
economic relations on a new basis," he said at a meeting with
local leaders of Belgorod in southern Russia, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark on his first campaign tour outside
Moscow both as the incumbent president and a presidential
candidate since his official registration for the presidential
race Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The integration process of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) entered a new stage following the signing of an
agreement on March 29 to push the process by Russia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Kirghizstan, and of another agreement between
Russia and Belarus to establish a "union" Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the pace of the integration process varies among
CIS members, Yeltsin said the process will not be determined by
Russia alone.
</P>
<P>
He said if everything was determined by Russia, the integration
process would be much faster.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia will not force other countries to unite with it,
nor will it take over all of their problems.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin declined to predict the prospect of the Russia-Belarus
Union, saying it was still too early to say whether the two
countries will form a federation or confederation.
</P>
<P>
Apart from President Yeltsin, two other candidates -- Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and the Liberal Democratic Party
leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky -- have registered with the Central
Electoral Commission for the presidential election slated for June
16 this year.

Meechai Ruchupan, re-elected for a four-year term, said the

<HEADLINE> Enterprises to Be Bearers of Syndicated Loans for Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enterprises will borrow
syndicated loans from foreign and domestic banks to develop
business portfolios in the agricultural sector, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This was the understanding reached Friday by senior
agricultural, industrial, commercial, financial and scientific
officials at a national conference on rural finance and
agricultural industrialization in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Vice-Minister of Agriculture Zhang Yanxi as
saying that encouraging enterprises to engage in agricultural
business can help the millions of rural households engaging in
small-parcel farming get broader access to the market.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises are expected to play the role as "bearers" of
syndicated bank loans for an influx of investment and
manufacturing technology into the countryside, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Official figures suggest that because of the lack of such
bearers, more than 90 percent of foreign and Chinese investment
into the agricultural sector is in government loans and
low-interest bank credits through Chinese administrative
departments.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments' tight control of financing is hampering
the development of industrializing agriculture through
manufacturing, processing, storage, transporting, marketing, and
managerial know-how.
</P>
<P>
Financing agriculture through enterprises is a new concept for
the country's banking circles, which are calling for the
formulation of new regulations by the government, an official with
the Ministry of Agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is facing challenges, and it may fail to
meet the rising domestic demand for food if the structure of
agriculture, industry and commerce are not reorganized to support
the rural economy in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates show China needs a total of 130 billion yuan
to 180 billion yuan (15.7 billion to 21.7 billion US dollars) in
investment to increase annual grain output by 50 million tons by
the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in Hangzhou city
in east China's Zhejiang Province recently unearthed a porcelain
kiln dating from the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279).
</P>
<P>
Remains of three porcelain-making workshops have been found at
the kiln site three meters underground, which is located near the
imperial street of the dynasty that made present-day Hangzhou as
its capital.
</P>
<P>
Two glazed porcelain jars each with a diameter of one metre and
a great number of porcelain kettles, probably made for sodliers,
have been found in the workshops.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the find will contribute to the study of
private porcelain kilns in the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The experts have been excavating Southern Song capital site,
then called Lin'an, since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Over 30 Federal Soldiers Killed in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 5 (Xinhua) - More than 30 Russian soldiers were
killed and 67 wounded in heavy overnight fighting with rebels in
southern Chechnya, the Interfax News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place at the village of Goiskoye which the
government troops took over from the rebels early Thursday but
lost again in the night.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax said that Russian military operations against
Dudayev's rebel forces across southern Chechnya had been
continuing in the past days.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month, Yeltsin offered a plan of peaceful
settlement of the Chechen issue, ordering a halt to the army's
full-scale offensive from April as part of his bid to ease the
16-month conflict before the Russian presidential election.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian army commanders in Chechnya said Yeltsin's
order did not mean a halt to all military operations, they would
continue "special operations" against armed Dudayev's rebels while
withdrawing troops from part of the region.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the peaceful process characterized with
signing a truce agreement, sponsored by the Russian federal army,
the Chechen government and the local authorities in the region, is
still under way, 155 of 365 Chechen villages have agreed to join in
the process.

</P>
<P>
Earnings for the province from medicines were a real tonic,
says officials.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technological progress enabled the
pharmaceutical industry in the province to grow rapidly over the
past five years, says the Provincial Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
An official of the bureau said that the industry manufactured
pharmaceuticals worth 47.8 billion yuan (5.75 billion US dollars)
during the 1991-95 period, a 250 percent increase over the
previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The industry turned out 11 billion yuan worth of
pharmaceuticals last year, 11 percent of China's total
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years pharmaceutical factories produced 121
types of new medicines, and 330 types of new medical equipment --
both significantly more than the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Twelve pharmaceutical factories each manufactured at least 100
million yuan worth of products last year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the industry's rapid growth was due
primarily to increased investment in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years the industry spent 600 million yuan
developing new products, and upgrading technology.
</P>
<P>
As a result, each worker generated 25,400 yuan in profits and
taxes in 1995, more than colleagues in any other province-level
areas in China.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Make Conditional Compromise to NATO: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said today that Russia would make a conditional compromise with
NATO over its eastward expansion program.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia is prepared to make compromise on condition that
the North Atlantic alliance will not deploy its military
facilities near the Russian borders.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remark at a ceremony marking the
75th birthday anniversary of Nikolai Inozemchev, a famous Russian
economist and academician, at the Russian Institute of World
Economy and International Relations.
</P>
<P>
Primakov described the NATO expansion as a factor which only
sharpens the relationship among former Cold War foes.
</P>
<P>
It is completely unsuitable, he stressed, for NATO to impose
its geopolitical and military projection on Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said that though his country does
not have a veto right concerning the NATO expansion, it can stand
up to safeguard its national interests if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Russia will have to resort to corresponding measures if its
compromise fails to lead to a solution of the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will raise
the topic of the NATO expansion in April at the Moscow summit on
nuclear safety by the group of seven (G-7) industrial countries
and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims Release 18 of 28 Imprisoned Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslim authorities
released late today 18 imprisoned Serbs after the three Bosnian
parties were asked to release all their prisoners of war by
midnight tonight or face exclusion from the next week's donation
conference.
</P>
<P>
The imprisoned Serbs had first been transferred earlier in the
day from the Muslim town of Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia to a
prison in Sarajevo, from whence they were eventually taken to the
Serb stronghold of Pale before the deadline expired.
</P>
<P>
They were escorted by the international community's Deputy High
Representative for Bosnia Michael Steiner, the Serb news agency
SRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Steiner also met in Pale with the Serb state of Republika
Srpska's parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik to discuss the
release of the remaining prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the
Muslims held 28 Serbs before today's release, the Croats still
hold 44, and the Serbs are holding 16 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by a representative of the Hague-based
International Tribunal for War Crimes in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord, the Bosnian parties should have
released all their prisoners by January 19, but the deadline has
been extended several times, only to be disregarded every time by
the three sides.
</P>
<P>
International mediators finally conditioned the participation
in a donator's conference in Brussels on April 13-14 upon the
release of prisoners in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no reports about the release of pows
from the other two sides -- the Serbs and the Croats.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Debt Increases Quickly in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Americans' consumer debt grew
by a 13.9 percent annual rate in February, the fastest pace in
eight months as each of the major categories of consumer credit
posted sharp gains.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) announced today that the strong
increase of consumer installment credit in the country was the
steepest since it rose by 14.4 percent last June. It was up by 12
billion dollars, the biggest since a 12.8 billion dollar advance
in last May.
</P>
<P>
The increase in February boosted total consumer debt to 1.048
trillion dollars in the U.S., 14 percent higher than in February
1995.
</P>
<P>
The consumer debt increased by 10.9 billion dollars in January,
an annual rate of 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by real
estate.
</P>
<P>
Analysts contend that consumers eventually will have to control
their borrowing activity as debt levels climb and income growth
remains relatively slack.
</P>
<P>
Private spending grew only 1.2 percent during the final three
months of 1995, down from gains of 2.8 percent in the third
quarter and 3.4 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
But in February, revolving credit in the U.S., which includes
credit cards, jumped by 6.4 billion dollars, the biggest advance
since a 7.4 billion increase last May. The 19 percent annualized
gain was the steepest since 20.5 percent in June. The increase
pushed total revolving debt to 407.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Automobile loans rose by 3 billion, a 10.3 percent annualized
gain, and pushed motor vehicle debt to 359.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The credit category that includes loans for mobile homes,
education, boats, trailers and vacations increased by 2.6 billion
dollars, a 11.3 percent rate, to 281.2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tanker Leaks Toxic Chemical into Mexican Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A Norwegian tanker has spilled
at least 18,000 gallons of toxic chemical into the waters near a
southern U.S. port, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Bow Sun, a Norwegian tanker, leaked tetrachloroethylene into a
popular shrimping area about 18 miles off the coast near Port
O'Connor, Texas, after someone opened the wrong valve Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The spill, about 22 miles long, was reported Thursday morning
to the Coast Guard by the tanker's crew.
</P>
<P>
The chemical, toxic to fish and probably to shellfish as well,
is expected to kill an unknown number of fish in the area,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
They said that since the chemical, which is heavier than water,
sinks quickly to the bottom of the sea, there is no way to clean
it other than wait for it to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred when crew members flushing out one of the
vessel's tanks opened the wrong valve, said Allan Strand of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

<HEADLINE> No Legal Grounds for Bosnian Serb Colonel's Trial:  Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The lawyer of detained Serb Army
Colonel Aleksa Krsmanovic said today that there were no legal
grounds for his client to be tried by the Bosnian Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade lawyer Igor Pantelic said on Bosnian Serb television
today that "the Hague tribunal has taken a decided and clear
decision that Colonel Krsmanovic is not guilty," which meant that
his innocence was "beyond the shadow of doubt."
</P>
<P>
Krsmanovic and Serb General Djordje Djukic were arrested by
Muslim authorities in late January this year on an IFOR-controlled
road near Sarajevo on charges of committing war crimes. The two
senior officers were extradited to the Hague on February 8 at the
request of the the Hague International Tribunal for War Crimes in
the former Yugoslavia for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Hague tribunal, however, released Krsmanovic from custody
after it failed to find any evidence against him and returned him
to Sarajevo Wednesday night and the Bosnian government was
handling the case with legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"The tribunal's decision is mandatory, regardless of what
Muslim-Croat authorities, which have instituted proceedings,
think," Pantelic stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the Hague tribunal should have immediately and
unconditionally released Krsmanovic if it had wanted to boost its
prestige.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer added that his client would defend himself by
remaining silent and would in no way cooperate with the court in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
NATO-led IFOR spokesman in Sarajevo Major Simon Haselock called
on Muslim authorities Thursday to release Krsmanovic unless they
had "concrete evidence" of his guilt.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Praises Lebanon's Achievements in Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today spoke highly of Lebanon's achievements in reconstruction
since Hariri took office three years ago.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet held in his honor in Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Al Hariri's residence here tonight, Chirac called for a
participation of all the Lebanese people in their ambitious
reconstruction project, which was blueprinted by the Lebanese
billionaire-turned prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A personal friendship between Chirac and Hariri can be
traced back to the time before Chirac was elected to the
presidency in May, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"In the past three years, you have done a lot of work
and have overcome a lot of difficulties," the French president
said, "but there are still a lot of things waiting for
you."
</P>
<P>
"The countries in this region will manage to turn their
whole attention to self-developments, and will realize the
final success with a support of the international community,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"And France's support is for you and will not change, and
this is the message of promise and hope which I came
biringing with me to the Lebanese people," the French
president said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac described Beirut as a "bit constructing site,"
saying that it would become soon a modern capital of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, in his speech at the banquet, stressed his country's
adherence to a "permanent coordination" with Syria, Lebanon's
only Arab neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Hariri underlined assistances which Syria has provided to
Lebanon in order to put an end to the 1975-90 civil war and to
consolidate peace in the country, which has constituted a base
for the reconstruction in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction with the results of a permanent
coordination between Lebanon and Syria in the peace negotiations
for the liberation of the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
It was no surprise, he said, that France always supports
Lebanon's demand for an implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south lebanon to the international-recognized
border.
</P>
<P>
Hariri emphasized the cooperation between the country's three
top leaders in making great achievements since he assumed office
in October, 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the speeches, the French president conferred a medal on
the Lebanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in the Lebanese capital Thursday afternoon on
the first leg of his tour in the region.
</P>
<P>
He has held met with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House
Speaker Nabih Berri, Hariri and other political and religious
leaders.

ADDIS ABABA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia earned 141.7 million
U.S. Dollars in foreign currency by exporting 48,385 tonnes of

</P>
<P>
General Manager of the authority Tsegaye Birhane was quoted by

65.3 million dollars while private coffee exporters got 76.4
million dollars, by contributing 53 percent of the country's

He said the authority has, in line with the market economic
policy, given licences to 64 coffee exporters, over 3,000
coffee Collectors and 100 coffee hullers.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Status in Yugoslavia Critical: Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian state of
refugees sheltering in Yugoslavia, especially of those
accommodated collectively or staying with families, "is critical,"
the Yugoslav Red Cross said in its latest bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Municipal Red Cross organizations have been warning for months
that they can only provide minimum supplies of food, personal care
items, clothes and footwear for about 500,000 refugees who have
registered with the Yugoslav Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The situation is most difficult in Serbia's northern province
of Vojvodina where, in addition to 53,000 refugees who found
shelter in the province before Croatia's aggression on northern
and southern parts of Serb Krajina last August, 144,180 fled to it
after the aggression, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are staying with relatives for whom the
burden of hospitality is becoming too heavy both in the material
and in the psychological sense.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, refugees are overcome by a sense of guilt
because they feel they are burden to their relatives and therefore
experience psychological crises," the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin, foreign assistance to refugees in
Yugoslavia is insufficient and is mainly provided by the European
Union and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC).
</P>
<P>
In February, the EU humanitarian office provided food supplies
for only about 125,928 refugees in Belgrade where about 184,566
refugees have been accommodated collectively or are staying with
families.
</P>
<P>
The IFRC had distributed 400,000 packages of personal care
items by late March, while the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
had distributed about 200,000 winter jackets, the bulletin added.
</P>
<P>
All that, however, "is far from being sufficient." The Red
Cross organizations had only 5,000 tons of food in store in late
January, which is not even enough for monthly rations of food for
500,000 refugees, it noted.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 refugees are estimated to have fled the former
Yugoslavia's war zones to Yugoslavia during the past four years.
The crisis in the former Yugoslavia has forced a total of 3
million people in the region to become refugees or displaced
persons, and most of them are still not ready to return back
although the war in Bosnia finally drew a close last November.
