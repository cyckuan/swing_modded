<HEADLINE> EU Threatens Suit over UK, US Airline Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)

Monday threatened to take legal action against the British

government if it approves the proposed alliance between British

Airways (BA) and American Airlines on the terms the commission

considered too generous.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BA chief executive Robert Ayling said today in

London that he remained confident that BA and American Airline

could complete their alliance by the summer despite the EC's

threat.
</P>
<P>
Karel van Miert, the European Union's competition commissioner,

asked British antitrust authorities to insist on more concessions

from the two giant trans-Atlantic airlines while warning against

the risk of a jurisdictional wrangle over the plan.
</P>
<P>
The pact would "eliminate all competition, both current and

potential, between them on the market for transportation of

passengers between the U.K. and the U.S.," the EU commissioner

said in a letter sent to British Trade Secretary Ian Lang, which

was released to reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Lang urged BA and American to give up 168 of

their more than 3,000 weekly takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow

Airport in London as a condition for allowing the alliance to go

ahead.
</P>
<P>
However, Van Miert said in his letter that 168 slots would not

be enough to ensure adequate competition and the commission would

want some 300 to 400 slots to be surrendered.
</P>
<P>
Both Ayling and British antitrust authorities maintain that the

EC, the EU's executive body, has no jurisdiction over the

alliance. Britain's Ministry of Trade and Industry also expressed

disappointment over Van Miert's decision.

<HEADLINE> Ship Carrying Japanese Nuclear Waste to Pass Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The British cargo ship Pacific

Teal which left the French port of Cherbourg with eight tons of

reprocessed Japanese nuclear waste will pass the Good Hope Cape of

southern Africa on its route to Japan.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today by a joint communique signed by the

French state nuclear material company COGEMA, the Japanese

Federation of Electricity Companies, and the British Nuclear Fuel

Limited.
</P>
<P>
The ship, carrying highly radio-active, vitrified nuclear

wastes processed in a COGEMA plant in Cape Hague bordering the

English Channel, will arrive in the northeastern Japanese port of

Mutu-Ogawara in mid-March, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed between Paris and Tokyo in 1977-78,

Japan should bring home the vitrified nuclear wastes from its

nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Japan to ship back its nuclear

wastes reprocessed in France after the first shipment took place

in February 1995.

<HEADLINE> US CPI Rises 3.3 Pct in 1996, biggest in 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer price

index (CPI) increased by 3.3 percent for all of 1996, the biggest

gain in six years, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the jump was led by sharp increases in

energy and food costs last year. Outside those two areas, the

underlying inflation rate turned in its best performance in 31

years.
</P>
<P>
The big advance of the U.S. CPI in 1996 followed a 2.5 percent

increase in 1995, which had been the fourth straight year that the

cost of living had been below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest increase since a 6.1 percent jump in 1990, a

sharp increase that also reflected higher energy costs coupled

with an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
For last year, energy costs were up by 8.6 percent, the biggest

increase since an 18.1 percent surge in 1990. Food costs for all

of 1996 rose by 4.3 percent, also the biggest increase since a 5.3

percent rise in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile areas of energy and food, the so-called

core rate of inflation in the country rose just by 2.6 percent in

1996, matching the 1994 performance and the best showing since a

1.5 percent rise in 1965, the report said.
</P>
<P>
For last December, overall prices posted a fourth straight 0.3

percent increase, also reflecting a big jump in energy costs. But

outside food and energy, the core inflation rate posted a tiny 0.1

percent gain in the month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that as long as the CPI pattern in 1996 holds,

the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to feel compelled to start

raising interest rates to fight inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Requests Urgent UN Security Council Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today asked the

U.N. Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the military

situation along the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the president of the Security Council,

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ali Osman Mohamed Taha

called on the council to shoulder its responsibilities and to

convene an extraordinary meeting to examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ethiopian aggression violated the

U.N. Charter, international norms and the principles of good

neighborliness, constituting a grave threat to international

security and peace.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Ethiopian army has over the past two

days been shelling a number of cities relentlessly. The bombarded

cities include Kurmuk and Qeesan along the border strip between

Sudan and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Sudan maintained the right of self defense.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Foreign Ministry today summoned Arab ambassadors

in Khartoum, calling for assistance from the Arab states to help

Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir has

ruled out any political compromise with the rebels in the southern

part of the country in a speech to thousands of Sudanese rallying

in support of the government. The demonstrators accused Ethiopia

of aggression against Sudan and expressed their condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 Ethiopian troops and a group of Sudanese rebels

Sunday attacked the southern cities of Kurmuk and Qeesan, and

fierce fighting erupted between the two sides along 130 kilometers

of Sudanese-Ethiopian borders.
</P>
<P>
The General Headquarters of the Sudanese Armed Forces Monday

announced that the cities of Kurmuk and Qeesan were exposed to

shelling by all kinds of artillery and auxiliary weapons.
</P>
<P>
The shelling began 5.30 a.m. Sunday and lasted until 11

a.m. and the fighting was still going on in these areas today.

<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- France expelled to Spain Monday

evening the number two of the Spanish Basque separatist group ETA,

Josu Arkaus Arana, the Agence France Presse (AFP) today quoted his

wife Odile Hiriart as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arana was conducted to the Franco-Spanish border at Junquera in

Catalonia, and was handed over to Spanish police by French police,

said Hiriart.
</P>
<P>
He was on a hunger strike for 37 days and was very weak, said

Hiriart.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion was condemned by the French lawyers' union,

Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM), which described it as a

"flagrant violation of the international texts ratified by

France."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Interior Ministry today welcomed France's expulsion

of Arana, who was called Jose de Mondragon in Spain, and said that

he will be charged with three offenses in association with an armed

band.
</P>
<P>
Arana was arrested in 1991 in the Basque town of Biarritz in

southwestern France, and was detained without trial under a charge

of association with wrong-doers.
</P>
<P>
Although Madrid had not asked for his extradition, a French

commission in charge of expulsion said on December 12, 1996, that

his presence in France "makes up a grave danger to public order."

PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim

Young-Sam today criticized France for holding a discriminatory

attitude toward his country by canceling a plan to sell the

Thomson Multimedia (TMM) electronics corporation to the Daewoo

Electronics.
</P>
<P>
"The South Korean people think that the annulment of the sale

of Thomson is the result of a discriminatory treatment," the

Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted President Kim as saying to an

envoy of the French government, Jean-Claude Paye, in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that after the annulment, the South Korean people are

wondering whether France is a "reliable partner."

Paye was sent by French Prime Minister Alain Juppe to Seoul to

explain to the South Korean government about the annulment, made

in November, of a plan to sell Thomson SA group to Daewoo and the

Lagardere group of France.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision not to sell Thomson was made by the

Privatization Commission independent of government, and that the

government had to "respect the decision."
</P>
<P>
Kim said that the annulment will seriously affect relations

between South Korea and France, unless Paris takes measures to

"satisfy Seoul."

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Hebron Deal "Today or Tomorrow" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

said today that a Hebron deal between the Palestinians and

Israelis would reach "today or tomorrow".
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, Mubarak said the Palestinians now

feel satisfied over this progress, which gave them hope in the

possibility of finding out solutions to the remaining problems.
</P>
<P>
"A breakthrough about the further redeployment...will make the

Palestinians feel at ease because they had the impression that

after the Hebron deal there will be no progress on the West Bank

and Gaza," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that besides the solution of the remaining

sticking points, progress would also be achieved "in the coming

phases of the Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak voiced his belief that an extensive agreement on

expanding the Palestinian self-rule in Hebron and rural areas of

the West Bank could be reached "as soon as possible" and that the

unsettled problems are "four or five small issues."
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt had proposed that the next phase redeployment

after Israeli troops pullout from the West Bank's city of Hebron

should be done before the middle of 1998, but it had received no

replies from either party.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein picked up his suggestion and presented a new

compromise date to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli

Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu during his shuttle diplomacy

Sunday, said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Under the new formula on launching Palestinian autonomy in 80

percent of Hebron and the rural areas of the West Bank, the first

Israeli pullback is to be carried out by February 28, the second

and the third no later than mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
During previous talks, Arafat has wanted all pullbacks to

conclude by September 1997 as called for in the accords.
</P>
<P>
On follow-ups of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, Mubarak

said that the first step on the road of Israeli troop

redeployment should be taken on February 28 and other steps to

follow for a year till the middle of 1998 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak dismissed Israel's accusation that Egypt

encouraged the Palestinian hardline position in the peace

talks. "We have never tried to convince the Palestinians to delay

the application of the agreements as we are always keen on

achieving peace but a comprehensive and just peace," the

president added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his confidence in Netanyahu's commitment to the

implementation of the signed agreements, Mubarak said he is

"optimistic by nature."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries that made peace

with the Jewish state, have played an active role in the

Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique, Lesotho Urged to Reconsider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Bingu Mutharika, Secretary

General of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa

(COMESA) has urged Mozambique and Lesotho to reconsider their

decision to withdraw from the organization.
</P>
<P>
Mutharika told the press here today that the decision of the

two countries to quit the COMESA is a matter of concern to the

heads of state who established the regional body.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mozambique has just emerged from prolonged civil

war and requires special support in its plans to rehabilitate its

economy.
</P>
<P>
The country needs a market much larger than that is available

to it in southern Africa as it is considered as an awakening

giant whose future role in the COMESA is important, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As for Lesotho, Mutharika said, it has been of special

interest to the COMESA because of its small economy, and the

regional body has been devising ways of revamping the economic

activities in that country.
</P>
<P>
Mutharika noted that the COMESA has recorded significant

achievements in the areas of industrial, manufacturing and

agro-processing sectors which will benefit Mozambique and

Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Other successful COMESA programs that benefit the two

countries include trade development financing from the PTA Bank,

the COMESA Clearing House and the Trade Information Network.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and Lesotho announced their decision to withdraw

from the COMESA not long ago.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA, whose secretariat is based in Lusaka, is a

regional economic organization which groups countries in eastern

and southern Africa. It was founded in 1994 based on the regional

organization of preferential trade area for eastern and southern

Africa (PTA).

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Up by 5.3 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales increased

by 0.6 percent in December due to a slower-than-expected holiday

shopping season, helping hold the 1996 gain to 5.3 percent, the

U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales totaled a seasonally

adjusted 208.2 billion dollars in December, up from 207 billion in

the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The 0.6 percent advance last month matched the sales increase a

year earlier, which merchants had also described as disappointing.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last more than

three years -- were up 0.5 percent, erasing a 0.4 percent decline

last November.
</P>
<P>
Auto dealers increased by 0.7 percent after seeing a 1 percent

drop in November. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.6 percent in

December after being unchanged a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as clothing and groceries rose

by 0.7 percent after slipping 0.2 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The December activity pushed the U.S. retail sales for the

whole year of 1996 to 2.5 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 5.3 percent increase of sales in 1996, following a gain of

4.9 percent in 1995, was the largest since a 7.5 percent advance

in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Korean Groups Rap Japanese Ex-Minister for Defending Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Several Korean residents' groups

in Japan today blasted former Japanese cabinet minister Takami Eto

for his comments whitewashing Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of

the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot restrain our anger at shameless and unabashed

remarks distorting and embellishing Japanese colonial rule in

Korea," the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents

said in statement.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Eto reportedly said the treaty that effectively put

the Korean Peninsula under Japanese control was a

"country-to-country treaty" which can hardly be called an invasion.
</P>
<P>
"What's the difference between that and a merger of a town and

a village?" he was quoted by the Asahi Shimbun as saying.
</P>
<P>
Eto, who once served as construction and then transportation

minister, also said he doubted the credibility of the claim of

Korean "comfort women," who were forced into sexual slavery by the

Japanese army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The leader of another Korean rights group, Jiro Suzuki,

condemned as an "insult" Eto's statement defending "Japan's

misdeeds in the past."
</P>
<P>
He called on Eto, a ruling Liberal Democratic Party member of

the House of Representatives, to step down to take responsibility

for the gaffe.
</P>
<P>
Eto, 71, was forced to resign as Management and Coordination

Agency chief in November 1995 for claiming that Japan "did some

good things" during its rule of the Korean peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Violence Death Toll Drops in Kwazulu-Natal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A survey shows last

December has witnessed less death tolls in political violence in

Kwazulu-Natal Province as compared with the same period of 1995,

the South Africa's Human Rights Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
About 41 people died in political violence in Kwazulu-National

last December, as against 76 in December 1995, the committee's

spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman attributed the positive change to sustained

efforts by the police authorities, saying "without the presence of

the security force, the situation could have been much worse."
</P>
<P>
There was very little violent activity in urban areas, but

rural areas were still worst affected by violence, the spokesman

said,
</P>
<P>
Attackers appeared to have monitored the movements of the

security forces and often launched attacks when the police were

off guard, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal, one of the nine provinces in South Africa, has been

a "hot spot" where the ruling African National Congress and the

Inkatha Freedom Party, a leading organization of Zulu people in

the province, have been engaged in long confrontation resulted

from acute political differences.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Puts on Trial Former Politician for Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda today put on trial

Froduald Karamira, a former politician and considered one of the

50 masterminds for the 1994 genocide against Tutsis and moderate

Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the 50-year-old former

politician could be given death penalty if convicted of the

charges against him, which include "making speeches to encourage

massacres" and "participating in organization of massacres."
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan national radio stopped all programs and broadcast

live the trial, which took place in a small court in southwest

Kigali, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that Karamira was actually an ethnic Tutsi, but he

renounced his ethnicity and became the vice president of the most

radical branch of the Hutu Republican Democratic Movement called

"Power."
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in June last year at the Addis Ababa airport by

Ethiopian police, after being expelled from India at the request

of the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda began in December trial of people held responsible for

the death of 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994, and has

given two death penalties so far.
</P>
<P>
Some 90,000 people are waiting for trial in Rwandan jails over

charges of joining genocide.

MOGADISHU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were

killed and 22 others wounded in armed clashes between court

guards loyal to faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed and supporters

of religious leader Sheikh Ali Dhere in North Mogadishu last

night.
</P>
<P>
The armed confrontations began when militiamen of Mahdi

attacked the Shibbis Islamic Court supporting Sheikh Ali Dhere.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said the escalating animosity between the

two Abgal leaders began when an Islamic court loyal to Ali Mahdi

sentenced a former prisoner to death yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second armed confrontation between the forces of

Ali Mahdi Mohamed and those of Sheikh Ali Dhere since Ali Mahdi

Mohamed relieved Sheikh Ali Dhere from his chairmanship of

the Supreme Islamic Court in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali Dhere rejected to accept Ali Mahdi's intervention

in the Islamic courts operational systems, saying that Ali Mahdi

was not in a position to fire him.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Sell Out Lufthansa by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- German cabinet today approved a

bill to completely privatize the Deutsche Lufthansa airline by

selling the state's remaining 36 percent stake, Deutsche Presse

Agentur (DPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill, subject to parliamentary approval, would take effect

on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann expressed confidence

that the sale of the remaining stake could take place by the end

of the year.
</P>
<P>
At the current value of Lufthansa's shares on the market, the

36 percent stake would generate revenues of almost 3 billion marks

(1.88 billion U.S. dollars). Bonn's 1997 draft budget already

foresees the income from the privatisation.
</P>
<P>
The bill would guarantee that German shareholders would

maintain a majority interest in Lufthansa, or that in an extreme

situation such majority ownership could be restored, in keeping

with international law, the DPA quoted government officials as

saying.
</P>
<P>
To achieve that end, the bill demands that a buyer of the

Lufthansa shares should register his name and nationality.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Lufthansa shares on the stock markets are bearer

shares in which the owner is anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The bill makes provisions for German airlines to repurchase

their own shares once, under the vinculated share system, if it

becomes evident that foreign ownership rises beyond 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In an unlikely case that foreign investors' holdings go beyond

50 percent, the airlines can force these to sell those shares

acquired under the provisions of the new law.
</P>
<P>
German officials estimate that some 20 percent of Lufthansa

shares are currently owned by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The draft law also demands transparency from the airlines which

must, every three months, report how much of the ownership is in

German hands and how much in the hands of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the German state's remaining stake in Lufthansa

would conclude the phased-out privatisation of Lufthansa which got

underway in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In that year, Bonn sold 1.1 million shares and stopped buying

new Lufthansa shares. As a result, the state-owned stake dropped

to 36 percent from 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wissmann said the aim of the privatization is to convert the

airline into a competition-oriented "global player" free of state

interference.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also serve as a model for other future

privatizations being considered by Bonn, he said.
</P>
<P>
The complete privatization of Lufthansa followed the

privatization of the railway and post sectors. Bonn is considering

selling off state stake in housing, airport, mines and super

highways in a bid to enhance competitiveness of state-owned

enterprises.
</P>
<P>
German state-owned companies have been in the red for many

years owing to lack of competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> More Floods, Droughts Expected as Global Climate Warms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Floods and droughts are

expected to become more frequent as the global climate continues

to warm, said a senior scientist here with the National Oceanic

and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
</P>
<P>
As global temperatures increase, the hydrological cycle is

affected because large quantities of water will evaporate from the

Earth's soil and the atmosphere can also support greater amounts

of water vapor, the NOAA's senior scientist at the National

Climatic Data Center Thomas Karl said.
</P>
<P>
"This means more flooding with an increase in extreme

precipitation events, but also more droughts," he said.
</P>
<P>
In general, an increase in floods would occur where there is

enough atmospheric instability to trigger precipitation events.

However, the additional evaporation from the surface also leads

to a drying of the soil, and more severe and widespread droughts

arise where and when the atmosphere is not favorable to rain.
</P>
<P>
As for the United States which is expected to have more floods

in the future, observations since the beginning of the century

indicate that intense precipitation events have already increased

by about 20 percent, and cold season precipitation has increased

by nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recent events, like the flooding in the Northeast last autumn

and the flooding this winter, offer examples of the kind of

situations that are expected to be associated with an increased

risk of occurrence, Karl added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Exports Grow Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean exports value is

estimated to have increased by 10 percent last year to more than

1.9 billion U.S. Dollars, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported

today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country currently has enough foreign reserves

to cover more than four months of imports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said today while exports could have benefited from

the depreciation of the Zimbabwe Dollar, the value could have

been higher had the manufacturing sector recovered from the

drought-induced recession experienced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said tobacco, Zimbabwe's single largest export

earner, is estimated to have earned about 700 million U.S.

Dollars, gold 300 million U.S. Dollars and base mineral exports

more than 680 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the fastest growing sub-sectors of the

Zimbabwean economy, is estimated by industry experts to have

earned 130 million U.S. Dollars, with earnings set to rise to

early 300 million U.S. Dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Another start performer was the horticultural sector.

HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National

Traditional Healers Association (ZINATHA) said here today it has

made considerable progress towards finding a possible cure for

the deadly AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 percent of the country's 11 million population is

people die of AIDS each week.
</P>

ZINATHA President Gordon Chavunduka told journalists that

currently, the Geneva-based World Intellectual Property

Organization has approved and registered a patent application for

the anti-AIDS drug, PMZ, developed by the association.
</P>
<P>
Chavunduka said clinical trials will be held as soon as the

patent is received and if they are successful, commercial

production of the drug will start.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a drug which is likely to help cure AIDS, but

more work is still being done to boost its effectiveness since

tests have shown that the drug dissolves quickly in the body,"

the president said.

<HEADLINE> Huge Number of Children in UK Working Illegally: TUC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a quarter of children

aged under 13 in England and Wales are working illegally,

according to a Trade Union Congress (TUC) report.
</P>
<P>
The report published today was based on a national Mori survey

of 4,295 pupils aged between 11 and 16. Nearly 40 percent of those

surveyed either had term-time jobs or worked during the last

summer holidays.
</P>
<P>
The TUC said more than a quarter of schoolchildren with

term-time jobs said they were often or sometimes too tired to do

their homework because of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that some children were working in

factories, which was illegal. Children were suffering high

accident and injury rates while working. One in five had been

injured or had an accident at work, it added.
</P>
<P>
The TUC said, "British laws on the employment of schoolchildren

are a confusing mix of some national legislation and hundreds of

bylaws."
</P>
<P>
"While some bad employers knowingly exploit children as cheap

labor, most do not know what the law is -- and nor do parents or

their children," it said.
</P>
<P>
John Monks, TUC general secretary, said he was all for

schoolchildren earning extra pocket money, learning to be

independent and finding out about the world of work if they wanted

to.
</P>
<P>
"But we can't allow kids' education or health to suffer because

they are working illegally and in fact doing part-time jobs. Many

employers are probably just as confused as most parents about what

the law says on employing kids," he added.
</P>
<P>
What Britain needs urgently is clear: standardized laws and

proper resources for local authorities to enforce them

effectively, according to Monks.

BAGHDAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister

Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf has informed the Arab League (AL) of the

violations of its airspace by U.S. warplanes, the Iraqi News

Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter handed over to the AL chief Esmat Abdul-Meguid by

Iraqi permanent representative to the organization, the Iraqi

foreign minister said air violations by U.S. warplanes from their

Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian bases have amounted to 9,950 between

July 1 and December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The letter asked the AL secretary general to brief the Arab

countries on the letter.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iraq also protested to the United Nations against

the violations of its airspace by U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, the Iraqi foreign

minister said the U.S. warplanes flew hostile sorties and dropped

flares over Iraqi civilian facilities and residential areas

during the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf asked the Security Council to intervene to get these

"aggressive acts stopped." He also stressed Iraq's legal right to

claim material and moral compensation for the provocations.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces led by the United States set up two "no-fly

zones" in the south and the north of Iraq following the Gulf War

in 1991 on the pretext of protecting the Iraqi Shiites and the

Kurds. War planes of the allied forces often fly patrol missions

over the zones which are forbidden to Iraqi jets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik

Hariri today ruled out a large-scale Israeli aggression against

his country, but noted that the hardline Israeli government sees

it in its interest to create tension in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Mohammed Baalbaki, Chairman of the

Lebanese Press Syndicate, Hariri said that West and Arab leaders

placated him that Israel had no intention to launch a war

because it was "unacceptable to all world countries."
</P>
<P>
Hariri accused Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of

being "the only one in the world who does not want peace,"

Baalbaki told reporters following the interview.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's remarks came as south Lebanon has remained relatively

calm since the weekend after a spate of violence during the

period before and after the New Year.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli occupation forces and the Lebanese Muslim

guerrillas have not stopped their daily friction on the last

active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God which spearheads

a guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation in south

Lebanon, announced that one squad of its fighters carried

out an attack on an Israeli position in the so-called "security

zone" this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Amal movement, a Shiite moderate organization, said today

that its guerrillas killed two militiamen of the Israeli client

South Lebanon Army in the Israeli-occupied border strip Tuesday

night.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces opened artillery fire today at

Iglim Al-Toffah, a mountain ridge often used by guerrillas as a

springboard to launch attacks in the buffer zone, but no

casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"

in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border

attacks.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tension is running high

on the Swaziland-Mozambique border today after Swazi villagers

killed two alleged cattle rustlers at the weekend in northeastern

Swaziland, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three Swazis involved in the killing of the alleged

stock thieves were arrested on murder charges, SAPA quoted

informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the arrested Swazis were subsequently released at the

instruction of the director of public prosecutions, to enable

them to appear before their traditionaln chief, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Cattle rustling by Mozambican brigands is rife in Swaziland's

northeastern border region, and thousands of cattle have been

lost to theft over the past few years, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Mabila, a community chief in the affected area said

where the raiders are unable to find livestock, they resort to

burglary.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Agreement on Implementation of UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos

Clerides denied here today that an agreement had been reached

between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on immediate

implementation of a U.N. package of measures aimed at reducing

tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in reference to an announcement

late Monday night by U.S. State Department official Carey

Cavanaugh, who left here for Athens after a two-day visit to the

island. Cavanaugh allegedly said that President Clerides and

Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash gave their full support for

"immediate implementation" of the U.N. proposals.
</P>
<P>
No agreement has been reached apart from the earlier agreement

on the continuation of the military dialogue between the National

Guard and the Turkish troops on the basis of U.N. resolutions to

reduce tension, Clerides told the press.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. proposals include adoption of military code of

conduct, extension of the unmanning of army posts along the

demarcation line, removal of land mines and unloading weapons from

the posts near the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
So far, no breakthrough has been announced on the talks

under the U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides also noted he does not interfere with the

military dialogue as this is handled by the military.
</P>
<P>
Asked about press reports that the Cyprus government had

consented to a delay in the deployment of the Russian-made

missiles, Clerides described them as "totally unfounded".
</P>
<P>
Russia, he explained, had informed Cyprus it could not

deliver the missiles before 16 months elapse, despite the

government wishes to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh said Monday night that President Clerides promised

not to install the S-300 missiles for the next 16 months,

which the U.S. official believed will ease the tension on

the island.
</P>
<P>
However, President Clerides reiterated that "we cannot proceed

with a reduction of military tension alone without seeing any

progress on the substance of the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
The President also announced that he will visit Athens on

Thursday for talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis,

during which the U.S.-backed proposal for banning overflights of

Greek and Turkish military aircraft over the island would be

discussed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops

landed and seized the northern third of the island following a

short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Solana: Institutionalized Ties With Russia of Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier

Solana said today that the key to allay Russia's fear for NATO's

eastward expansion was to establish an "institutionalized

relationship" between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Belgian Royal Institute of International

Relations in Brussels, Solana said, "We need an agreement that

would suit our common interests and would establish a permanent

mechanism of consultation and joint action on those issues on

which NATO and Russia reach consensus."
</P>
<P>
With the approach of NATO's Madrid summit in July when NATO

will issue invitations for candidate countries in Central and

Eastern Europe to start accession talks, Russia finally agreed

last month to negotiate an agreement with NATO for a special

relationship with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia demanded a legal-binding document with specific

provisions which deal with its concerns about NATO's expansion,

actually asking for a vote right for issues concerning

enlargement.
</P>
<P>
In his speech today, Solana restated that NATO's enlargement

would "in no sense pose a threat to Russia."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, Russia's perceptions "do matter and they

must be taken seriously." Removing its "misunderstandings" towards

enlargement needed "special efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
Solana expressed once again NATO's wish of exchanging

representatives at each other's military headquarters with Russia,

an idea which was rejected by Russian Defense Minister Igor

Rodionov when he visited NATO last month.
</P>
<P>
Early next week, Solana will travel to Moscow to start the

first round of negotiation for a special NATO-Russia agreement

with his counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
NATO is wishing to have this agreement or charter ready by the

time of the Madrid summit in July.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Frederick

Sumaye today urged police officers in Tanzania to ensure that

they do not infringe human rights in exerrcising powers vested

upon them.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop on human rights for regional and division

police commanders at the Police Mess in Arusha, Northern Tanzania

today, the premier said the police force is there to maintain law

and order so that equal rights of individuals could be secured.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the official Daily News from Arusha,

Sumaye said that order in the country would promote good

governance and the rule of law without violating human rights.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, many people have been misleadigng the masses

on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this misleading, some people think that they can

infringe other people's rights in the name of human rights," the

prime minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are people who think that being

apprehended by police after breaking law is also an abuse of

human rights.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, Sumaye stressed, there is a need for

human rights education so that many people could be educated on

the basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister further said that human rights and the rule

of law are mutually complimentary terms adding that one cannot

exist without the other.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Addis Ababa today denied

its involvement in the takeover of two Sudanese border towns as

Khartoum urged the U. N. Security Council to prevent the alleged

Ethiopian attack on its territory.
</P>
<P>
It accused the Sudanese government, which also called for

general mobilization for Jihad or a holy war against "Ethiopian

aggressors", of trying to "externalize its internal military

debacle", said a statement issued here today by the Ethiopian

Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The statement said it was rebels of the Sudan People's

Liberation Army that took over the border towns while the

Ethiopian government troops had no connection with the military

development.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Ethiopian government will confer with other

members of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)

to seek a resolution of the Sudanese crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammad Taha

urged the U.N. Security Council "to take steps to ensure that

Ethiopia withdraws from positions inside Sudan and refrains from

carrying out further attacks."
</P>
<P>
It said the Ethiopian government troops had invaded its

territory and captured Kurmuk and Qeissan, the two border towns

about 600 kilometers southeast of capital Khartoum.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Coffee and

Tea Authority said today that Ethiopia has over six million

hectares of land suitable for tea development which could attract

private investors.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the House of People's Representatives,

Tsegaye Berhane, general manager of the authority, said the

potential of the sector has not yet fully exploited so far as

there is no participation of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Only two state-owned farms, the Wushwush and Gumero tea

plantations, are now producing over 3,000 tons of tea annually to

satisfy local demand.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are some 400,000 hectares of land covered by

coffee plantations in Ethiopia and the annual production volume

stands at about 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Coffee accounts for over 50 percent of the country's foreign

currency earning. Ethiopia earn 236 million U.S. Dollars from the

export of 108,000 tons of coffee to the world market in 1996/97.

<HEADLINE> Russian Diplomat Reacts Accusation on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Cyprus

Georgi Muratov today strongly reacted accusations by certain

countries against Cyprus' decision to purchase Russian-made

missiles and described them as "incomprehensible" and

"hypocritical".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here after a meeting with Socialist Edek

Party leader Vassos Lyssarides, Muratov said the acquisition by

Cyprus of the S-300s air-to-surface does not change things,

either in Cyprus or in the area since the anti-aircraft missiles

in question are purely defensive weapons.
</P>
<P>
Muratov noted that "if those countries which react to the

purchase are consistent, then they should impose an arms embargo

not only on Cyprus but also on Turkey, Greece and on the whole

of the region."
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat did not name those countries, but he was

apparently referring to the United States, Britain and other

western countries which came publicly against Cyprus' decision to

 acquire the Russian-made missiles and accused Russia of selling

weapons to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, Muratov reaffirmed that his country will cooperate

with the U.S. and other U.N. Security Council permanent members

toward a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Russian Foreign Ministry officials will

visit Cyprus within the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Russia has sold some advanced tanks and armored vehicles to

Cyprus in the past few years despite opposition from the

U.S. and other western countries.
</P>
<P>
The plan of the Cypriot government to purchase the Russian

missiles with a range of 150 kilometers has triggered Ankara's

military strike waning. Turkey has threatened to strike at the

missiles if they are deployed. But the Cyprus government has

claimed that it will go ahead with its defense program.

<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister of Luxembourg

Jacques Poos said today that the success of the Middle East peace

process needs the support from the U.S., the European Union and

the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Poos, who is visiting Egypt within the framework of a tour of

the region, made the remarks at a joint press conference with Arab

League Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid following their

meeting.
</P>
<P>
Poos said he is carrying a message to the league on the need to

support President of the Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not only needs the U.S. and

European Union support, but also that of the Arab countries," said

Poos, who is also Deputy Prime Minister of Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Poos said his visit to the Middle East aims at discussing

obstacles impeding the peace drive. He emphasized that it is

necessary to have the Arab countries' support to make the peace

process a success.
</P>
<P>
Meguid, for his part, said the meeting tackled the latest

developments in the Middle East with special focus on obstacles

impeding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the Arab countries are keen to effect a just and

balanced peace in the region to realize stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Meguid also lauded the European role in the peace process and

expressed the hope that EU, in cooperation with the U.S. and

international communities, would restart negotiations on the

Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also met with

Poos, who arrived here Monday night as part of his regional tour,

which will also take him to Jordan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg will assume the rotating EU presidency in the later

half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed to appoint a peace envoy to the region on

October 5. The 15-member block, urged by France, has been seeking

to play a greater role in the Middle East peace process, in which it

is already a chief financial backer.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security

Council renewed today a 28-member observer mission in the Prevlaka

Peninsula for another half year, until July 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council

commended the Agreement on Normalization of Relations between

the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,

which was signed in Belgrade on August 23, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement commits the parties to resolve peacefully the

disputed issue of Prevlaka by negotiation in the spirit of the

Charter of the United Nations and good neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Determining that the situation in Croatia continues to

constitute a threat to international peace and security, the

council urged the parties to abide by their mutual commitments and

to implement fully the Agreement on Normalization of Relations.
</P>
<P>
It requested the military observers and multinational

stabilization force authorized by the council on December 12, 1996

to cooperate fully with each other.
</P>
<P>
The Prevlaka Peninsula is in the Adriatic Sea and is a part of

Croatia. But it is located at the entrance to Boka Kotorska bay,

an important navy port of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. To

insure the safety of its ship, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia

managed in 1992 to negotiate an agreement with Croatia, declaring

the peninsula as a demilitarized zone. The U.N. Security Council

then sent military observers to help implement the agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A Royal Navy Task Group led by

the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, the biggest deployment of

Royal Navy ships since the Gulf War, left Portsmouth Monday for

the Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,500 personnel and 21 ships are involved in the

operation, visiting 34 countries and areas and taking part in 26

exercises during the next seven and a half months, according to an

official from the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The official told Xinhua that the aim of Ocean Wave '97 was to

demonstrate the UK's continuing commitment to the region and the

Royal Navy's ability to deploy an operationally effective and

self-sustaining maritime force for a prolonged period.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Soames, armed forces minister, said, "Britain has huge

interests in the Asia Pacific region -- commercial, political and

strategic.... It is essential to show commitment to the region."
</P>
<P>
"This shows our concern for the stability and health of that

part of the world. It will show Britain's determination to remain

a player on the world stage," he added.
</P>
<P>
Soames dismissed as "foolish idiotic speculation" suggestions

that the operation was a show of strength to China at the

hand-over of Hong Kong or an insurance policy should events not

run to plan.
</P>
<P>
"The orderly and smooth rundown of the Hong Kong garrison will

continue, and there is no reason to believe there will be anything

difficult whatever," he said.

Athens, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis

Tsohatzopoulos met today with the visiting Cyprus counterpart

Costas Eliades and the members of the island republic's

parliamentary defense committee to discuss matters of common

interest related to security, peace and cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the promotion of the Greece-

Cyprus joint defense doctrine during the three-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Eliades, accompanied by the Commander of the Cyprus National

Guard and the defense committee, arrived in Athens on Sunday for

talks with the Greek government on the entire range of issues

pertaining to Cyprus' defense.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed issues relating to the defense sector and the

Republic and Greek defense industries," Eliades said.
</P>
<P>
Tzohatzopulos declined to comment on statements by U.S. State

Department envoy Carey Cavanaugh, currently visiting Greece, who

said in Cyprus Monday that a deal had been struck between the

Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities aimed at reducing tension

along the ceasefire line dividing the island.
</P>
<P>
Eliades too was guarded when asked about the ongoing military

dialogue in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue is in progress and we have undertaken a

commitment not to make statements concerning it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to comment on. There is no decision,"

Tsohatzopoulos added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Believes in Future of South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia believe that there

is a bright future ahead for South-South cooperation, Ambassador

Nana S. Sutresna said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South-South Conference on Trade, Investment and

Finance, the Indonesian ambassador-at-large said that for such a

bright future to be realized, the developing countries have to

look closely at the resources they already have, muster them and

make full use of them.
</P>
<P>
"If we do just that, then I am confident that sooner than we

have imagined, South-South cooperation will solve many of the

problems of development in our respective countries and at the

same time prepare us to participate in the solution of the global

problems of our era," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the progress of South-South cooperation, Sutresna

said that the intra-regional trade among developing countries in

Latin America increased by 75 percent during the 1985-1990 period;

in Africa, by 60 percent; and Asia, by almost a hundred percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the value of sub-regional and intra-regional trade

in nominal terms has achieved levels two to three times higher

than the peaks reached at the end of the 1970s, from 17 billion

dollars to 28 billion dollars in Latin America, from 2.2 billion

dollars to 4.3 billion dollars in Africa, and from 18.2 billion

dollars to 41 billion dollars in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite these encouraging trends in sub-regional and

intra-regional trade, the volume of South inter-regional trade

remains relatively small. "It is important for the South to find

ways of further intensifying inter-regional trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to investments, the ambassador suggested that there

is a need for cooperation at all levels among developing countries

on investment because the incentives they have offerred to attract

investors sometimes become unnecessary competition among

developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In the area of finance, he said, the exchange of experts and

the promotion of human capacities, privatization and adjustments

to create domestic investment climates are critical if domestic

resources are to be mobilized and foreign investment is to be

effectively attracted.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Political Parties Attack Cyprus' Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Political Parties in

parliament today voiced their determination to block the Cyprus

government's deployment of the Russian-made S-300 missiles in

Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
This came following a briefing to the parliament by Defense

Minister Turhan Tayan on the latest developments of the missile

crisis on the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Left Party Chairman Bulent Ecevit said that Turkey

should do what it did in 1974 to prevent the missiles from

being deployed on the divided island if the situation becomes

even worse.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who was prime minister in 1974, ordered the Turkish

armed forces to land on the island to protect Turkish Cypriots

after a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the True Path Party, Dogan Gures, a

former chief of the General staff of the Turkish Armed Forces,

said that Turkey should not make any concessions in order to

avoid further similar cases in the future. He added that Turkey

should do everything to block Cyprus' purchase of the missiles

with a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Kahraman Emmioglu from the ruling Welfare Party said the

missile deployment plan has revealed Cyprus' Enosis dream was

still alive and that Turkey should spare no effort to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that certain circles should not try to take

advantage of the relatively weak coalition government, Bulent

Akarcali said that the Turkish nation should unite to face the

current crisis concerning state interests.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to launch a military strike against

Cyprus after the Cyprus government signed a contract with Russia

to buy the surface-to-air missiles worth of 250 million

U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces Ismail

Hakki Karadayi today wound up his two-day visit to northern

Cyprus to show Turkey's determination to block the missile

program.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu

Ciller is reportedly to visit northern Cyprus soon to put

pressure on the Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Monday, Turkish Foreign Ministry

spokesman Omer Akbel said that there was no divergence of

views between the Turkish government and military over the

current Cyprus issue.

Located in Huanghua City in the Bohai Bay, the zone currently
has five high-yield oil wells.
</P>
<P>
It was China's first offshore area under joint prospecting by
the China National Petroleum Corporation along with XCL and Apache
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Soon after China announced the opening up in 1993 of oil
prospecting in a 410,000-square-kilometer area in its northern
parts, the Chinese and American companies concluded a 30-year risk
exploration contract to jointly prospect for oil in the Zhaodong
Zone.
</P>
<P>
They first discovered oil and gas for industrial use in the C-1
exploratory well in June 1994.

<HEADLINE> Dalian People Take on Best Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Every morning at bus stops in
northeast China's port city of Dalian, white-collared workers can
be seen waiting for shuttle buses in their best business clothes.
</P>
<P>
The city, which holds an international garments festival each
year, is known for its dress sense.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that spending on clothes in the city ranks first
among the 35 major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Dalian people's passion for beautiful clothes did not wane even
in the most difficult period in 1960s, when it was hard to find
enough food. They would tighten their belts a bit more to save for
a piece of fine cloth.
</P>
<P>
But people's taste for clothes has improved as time goes by.
The locals now pay more attention to whether their clothes are
suitable for their professions, identities and different social
occasions, rather than whether it is fashionable.
</P>
<P>
The city's mayor Bo Xilai takes the lead in dressing according
to social occasions. He is always in trim uniform while meeting
with foreign guests or presiding at meetings.
</P>
<P>
"I think that wearing a tie and business suit shows a formal
and conscientious work style, so we require all civil servants in
the city to dress in business suits when on duty," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
He failed to wear a suit at last year's new year concert
because there was not enough time to change after he returned from
an inspection in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
However, the mayor still managed to change into his formal suit
during the interval.
</P>
<P>
"I usually wear a uniform at work with little decoration," a
woman employee in the municipal government said, "but I will make
up, take on more stylish clothes and wear some jewelry, when I
attend a wedding or party."
</P>
<P>
She confided that she never buys an item of clothing if she
sees someone wearing the same outfit in the street.
</P>
<P>
More and more Dalian people are aware of the function of
clothes in presenting the individual's character. They will often
consider if an item of clothing suits their figures and
personalities before digging into their pockets to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
Dalian people's love for clothes has also built a bridge
between China and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The city held the 8th International Garments Festival last
year, during which over 87 million US dollars of clothing-export
contracts were signed.
</P>
<P>
With the contracts, China will export clothes, children's
clothing, suits and knitwear to 26 countries and regions,
including Japan, the Republic of Korea, the US, and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Senior Leader of Nepali Ruling Party Demands PM's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of Nepal's
main ruling party today demanded that the party ask Prime Minister
Sher Bahadur Deuba to resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the Nepali Congress (NC) party Shailaja
Acharya said in a statement issued here that the NC party should
ask for the resignation of the prime minister without delay to end
the current political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Seeking a vote of confidence for the present government will
not provide a solution to the crisis in the parliament, said
Acharya, a famous maverick leader of the NC party.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba, also from the NC party, is expected to
seek a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament after
his coalition government narrowly defeated a no-confidence motion
tabled by the opposition in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government was reduced to the minority status last
month as 101 MPs voted in favor of (with 84 MPs against) the
no-confidence motion filed by the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) in the 205-seat lower
house.
</P>
<P>
Acharya, reportedly ambitious for the post of prime minister,
has always been a critic of the Deuba coalition government since
it was formed in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PA Hail Egypt's Role In Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Both of the Palestinian Authority
(PA) and Israel today hailed the intense efforts Egypt had made in
helping facilitate a settlement to the West Bank town of Hebron
and other issues in the small hours today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu phoned Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak following the initialing of the executive protocol on the
Israeli troops redeployment in Hebron before dawn today.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their appreciation of the role played by Egypt
and President Mubarak in helping the two sides overcome the
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak congratulated them on reaching an accord which he said
would further efforts to establish a just and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Ambassador here Zohdi al-Kodra commended
the efforts and support by Egypt and Mubarak for overcoming the
snags hindering the initialing of the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows that there is no peace without the
participation of Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cairo had witnessed, over the past few days, a series of
meetings and contacts among peace parties concerned, which have
made their impact on initialing the accord, Kuddrah said.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the accord without procrastination will
further the peace process in accordance with the Oslo agreements
and Madrid conference principles, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, PA Minister of International Cooperation Nabil Shaath
also paid tribute to Mubarak's efforts in recent days in helping
the two sides reach an executive protocol on Israeli redeployment
in Hebron and the rural areas of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by radio Voice of Arab today, Shaath said Egypt is
the strong pillar on which the Palestinians rely.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mubarak and Arafat had maintained contacts in the
past hours.
</P>
<P>
Shaath pointed out that the Palestinian side requests the
U.S. to continue its role as peace sponsor in the coming phase and
to seek the implementation of signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, is a
staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause and has been active in
brokering the long-awaited Hebron deal.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls for Closer Ties between Army, Government, People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called for greater progress to be made in unity between the
People's Liberation Army, the government and the people.
</P>
<P>
He issued the call while meeting delegates at a national
meeting in Beijing today to honor 197 Chinese counties and cities
as models in the work of "shuangyong".
</P>
<P>
"Shuangyong" is a word used to convey the concept, 'for the
government and people, supporting the army and assisting soldiers'
families, and for the army, supporting the government and loving
the people'.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said that shuangyong has long been a good tradition and unique
political advantage for the Party, army and people.
</P>
<P>
Closer ties between the army, government and people have always
produced a strong power, either during war time or in peaceful
periods since the establishment of new China, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
It is an irrefutable truth that "so long as the army and people
are united as one, they can defeat any enemy", he said.
</P>
<P>
He expected the honoring of the model counties and cities to
enhance the work of shuangyong nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, Vice Chairman of the
Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing and a number of other
senior leaders also met the delegates today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Liu said that it is essential to
consolidate and develop the current good situation in the unity
between the army, government and people through their concerted
efforts.
</P>
<P>
It is the common responsibility of society to do well
in shuangyong, and strengthen unity between the army, government
and people, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged both governments at various levels and the army to
tackle any new problems in the ties between the army and the
government and people, and ensure a sound and comprehensive
development in the work of shuangyong.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, State Councillor and Head of the National Leading
Group of the Shuangyong Work, delivered a report at
today's meeting.

the players to do their best in every game," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Rival Parties Agree to Withdraw Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Two rival Iraqi Kurdish groups
today agreed to withdraw their forces from the disputed areas
along the cease-fire line, said a joint statement issued by the
two parties.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by the Iraq-backed Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) and the Iran-backed Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) said that these areas will be monitored by the
Peace Monitoring Force (PMF) after the third rounds of talks on
the issue of northern Iraq which started in Ankara Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said all participants of the talks agreed to
augment the PMF to make an effective monitoring of the cease-fire
line possible.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Turkey, the United States and Britain met
with Iraq's three delegations: the KDP, the PUK and Turkmen
Front, to review progress in implementing the principles agreed
on October 31 and November 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that all participants reiterated their
commitment to the consolidation of the cease-fire reached by the
PUK and the KDP and expressed their satisfaction with the
completion of the demarcation on the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and the PUK reiterated their commitment to take all
necessary measures to provide security for the members of the
Peace Monitoring Force (PMF), which is likely to be deployed next
 month.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and the PUK also promised not to disrupt civilian
services and to exchange prisoners and the remains of those
killed in previous fightings with the assistance of the
International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) and monitoring of
the Supervisory Peace Monitoring Group (SPMG).
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey and the U.S., co-chairmen of
the third round of talks on northern Iraq issue, stressed the
importance of the principle of fair distribution throughout
northern Iraq of the benefits of revenue collected and had
called on the KDP and the PUK to develop a mechanism to achieve
that purpose.
</P>
<P>
A higher coordination committee made up of three
representatives separately from the KDP, the PUK and Turkmen
sides, will meet once a month to promote political
reconciliation as identified in the Final Statement of October
31 last year, and will coordinate with the SPMG over the issues
such as education, health, transportation and free movement of
people.
</P>
<P>
Both the KDP and the PUK agreed not to seek the intervention
of any other forces which may aggravate the conflict or raise
tensions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
All participants agreed to take into account the legitimate
security interests of Turkey and Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity in the settlement of the northern Iraq
issue.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to continue meeting periodically to augment their
mutual cooperation in order to reinforce peace and stability in
the region for the benefits of all of its inhabitants, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, supported by President Saddam Hussein, fought with
the PUK in late August, which led to U.S. air strike against
Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The two groups signed a peace deal on October 31, 1996 under
mediation by the U.S., Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish rebels
since the gulf war in 1991, but it split into rival zones after
the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who was hospitalized for pneumonia, will stay in Moscow's Central
Clinical Hospital until the end of this week, a chief Kremlin
doctor said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Mironov, head of the Medical Center of the Presidential
Administration, told reporters that Yeltsin's health condition has
been "quite stable" with normal temperature over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Mironov said that Yeltsin has caught a bad cold after taking a
bath, denying the passive impact of the recent heart surgery
which the president underwent on November 5, 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that the surgery has created "a greater protective
potential for the organism than expected."
</P>
<P>
After the heart bypass surgery in 1996, Yeltsin returned to the
Kremlin on December 23. But he was hospitalized again on January 8.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Some deputies of the State Duma (the
lower house of the Russian parliament) have urged Yeltsin to give
up his power.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federal Council (the upper house
of parliament), said today that it is hardly possible for some
State Duma deputies to oust the president for health reasons.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Healthy Growth of Rural Firms: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Rural enterprises in China need
to make efforts to improve their quality to ensure a sound and
rapid growth, Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national working conference on rural enterprises
that concluded in Beijing today, Jiang said that rural enterprises
must markedly increase their standards of management, technology,
products and services to meet modern market demands.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy 18 years
ago, rural enterprises have developed vigorously and become the
backbone of the nation's rural economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, rural enterprises account for two-thirds of the
rural output value, and one-third of the country's gross domestic
product, contributing in a remarkable way to the social and
economic development of the country and helping farmers become
prosperous, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier, however, pointed out that rural enterprises
are now confronted with problems and challenges which should
be treated properly.
</P>
<P>
"The core of the problems is that a large number of rural
enterprises cannot stay in line with the requirements of the
market because of poor management and low efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
While many rural enterprises now suffer from a high
debt-to-asset ratio, their production scales are too small to
compete in the market, and their industrial structure is
irrational, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that there is also a large development gap in the
regional distribution of rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that some rural enterprises have caused heavy
environmental pollution and occupied too much farmland.
</P>
<P>
"We must be fully aware of the challenges and problems the
rural enterprises now face, and strive to overcome them with a
sense of urgency and responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a major task for us to make strategic readjustments
to rural enterprises in the coming years," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, rural enterprises must maintain a moderately
high growth rate and on the other hand, they should concentrate on
improving their own quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged rural enterprises to deepen reform, rationalize their
product mix, facilitate technological progress, strengthen
management, and increase competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
It is also essential to protect resources and the environment
in earnest, to achieve a sustainable development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier asked governments at various levels to take
effective measures to solve practical problems for rural
enterprises and create a better environment for their reform and
development.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Chen Junsheng presided over the 2-day
conference, which was attended by leading officials from
departments of the central authorities and provincial
governments.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Still Receives Iraqi Free Oil: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Jordanian Minister of
Energy and Mineral Resources Hisham Dabbas has said that Jordan is
still receiving free oil from Iraq, which is estimated to be half
of the amount of crude Iraq exports to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
According to al-Ahali Weekly, Dabbas said that the talks
conducted here recently to reach new agreements on the oil aid for
Jordan this year were "successful and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
The minister said during the talks the Iraqi side promised to
guarantee the supply of half of Jordan's crude oil needs free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
Economic observers here say the oil Jordan has received, since
the U.N. embargo on Iraq was imposed in 1990, is estimated at
around 2.053 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
They said the value of the oil exports to Jordan would reach
2.875 billion dollars if the aid is included.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has enjoyed a favored oil price in trade with Iraq at 15
dollars per barrel, while in the world market, the price was 25
dollars per barrel.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China has invested 21.5 billion
yuan in the construction and renovation of farmland irrigation
projects over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the conservancy projects destroyed in last
summer's devastating floods have been renovated, according to
sources at the Ministry of Water Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
The work in north China has now been suspended because of cold
weather. But in southern provinces now is the best time to build
such projects.
</P>
<P>
There are up to 100 million people a day working at the
construction sites in southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 23 provinces and autonomous regions have set up
special funds for the development of water-conservancy projects,
or projects to fight against floods.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have repeatedly emphasized the importance of
building more water conservancy projects. They have also called
for more input in agriculture, to obtain a successful growth of
grain.

<HEADLINE> Young Industrialists Urged to Work for HK's Smooth Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief
Executive designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, today called on young industrialists to make greater
contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition, prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of over 600 young industrialists and
businessmen from financial and commercial communities this
evening, Tung praised young industrialists as the backbone of
Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, organized by the Hong Kong Young Industrialists
Council, was held to mark the operation of the new executive
committee of the council.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that young industrialists have made great
contributions to Hong Kong's industrial and commercial
development, Hong Kong's exchanges with overseas business
communities and its talent training programs.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects the council to do more work to spread the
knowledge of the Basic Law of the HKSAR and to support the
preparations for the formation of the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Leung Wai-ho, president of the council, said that in face
of severe challenges from the world, Hong Kong's industry has to
increase input into high technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong should set up a high technology base for
scientific research so as to absorb new technology and talents as
well as overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1992, the Hong Kong Young Industrialists Council
consists of 77 outstanding young entrepreneurs with an annual
output value of 53.6 billion HK dollars (6.9 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The young industrialists run businesses in Hong Kong and on the
Chinese mainland, hiring more than 250,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Finishing Touches Underway In Airport Passenger Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Architectural fitout works
are going in full swing for the Passenger Terminal Building (PTB)
at the Chek Lap Kok New Airport, which will open in April, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The building, considered one of the largest in the world,
extends 1.3 km long and covers a floor space of 70 football
pitches. The fitout project, composed of 17 nominated
sub-contracts, is estimated to cost 1.7 billion HK dollars (217
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The interior of the PTB will be "Cathedral-like", according to
the Airport Authority who oversees the mammoth New Airport
project.
</P>
<P>
Shining through the glass curtain walls and skylights,
natural light will be reflected upwards to the wing-shaped roof
and diffused across the building. Control systems will usher in
artificial light when night falls.
</P>
<P>
Five types of granite will be used for hard flooring in the
public areas, commercial areas and government processing areas. In
addition, a huge carpet of 88,000 sq. m. will stretch across the
public area. A total of 12,500 passenger seats will be arranged in
different shades of color.
</P>
<P>
Environmental friendliness has been incorporated into the PTB
interior design. The curved roof, for instance, not only makes
good use of natural light, but also consumes five times less
energy than a conventional flat roof.
</P>
<P>
One core principle in the PTB interior design is to bring
passengers convenience. Passengers will be able to know where they
are and where they are going at all times inside the building.
There are minimal level changes for passengers either departing or
arriving. They are able to see aircraft from most parts of the
building so as to locate the departure gates.

<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The sound of silence has led to
the signing of a major contract with Iran by a company in the
capital of central China's Hubei Province. The west Asian country
will be supplied with Chinese-built subway silencers.
</P>
<P>
The 21-million-yuan (2.53 million US dollar) contract is the
biggest ever export deal for noise control products in China,
according to "China Environmental News".
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Tongyong Mechanical and Electronic Environmental
Protection Products Corporation, a large-size state-owned
enterprise, has the country's largest testing base for silencers.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 saw the company's turnover approaching 100
million yuan (12.05 million US dollars), an increase of 30 million
yuan (3.61 million US dollars) over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government and the provincial bureau of
environmental protection plan to recommend the corporation's
listing on the stock market. The action has been endorsed by the
State Bureau of Environmental Protection and the China Securities
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the development of the company has attracted the
attention of the World Bank, which has agreed on a loan project
valued at 440 million yuan (53 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tibetan Herdswomen Run Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pots of piping hot mutton and
savory "tuba", unique Tibetan paste porridge, were simmering on a
stove. Nearby customers were eating to their heart's content in
the warm room.
</P>
<P>
This was the scene in a successful restaurant run by two
Tibetan sisters on a bustling street in Nagqu Town, in Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The neat and tidy eatery also provides buttered tea and sweet
tea -- despite burning cow dung for its heating.
</P>
<P>
Herdsmen in fur-lined jackets, neighboring government workers
in suits, and passers-by who travel the Qinghai-Tibet Highway,
delight at the cosy place with its butter flavored delights and
North Tibetan hospitality.
</P>
<P>
"The service here is good," a middle-aged government employee
at the Nagqu science and technology commission, said. "We also
trust the hygienic conditions as well as the food."
</P>
<P>
Sisters Yang Ci and Yang Gar, two former herdswomen who
traditionally held that the running of businesses was shameful,
have won respect from various diners, and become reputed in the
small town, less than one year after opening their restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Half of more than 200 private businesses in the town are run by
girls who hailed from the pasturelands, said an official at the
county's Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ci and Yang Gar, from a ranch in nearby De'gyi Township,
were employed a year before by a restaurant boss from adjacent
Sichuan Province. However they wanted to be their own boss.
</P>
<P>
"We were in a dreadful rush when facing so many strangers at
first," the elder Yang Ci, 25, said, "But now we have become
accustomed to it."
</P>
<P>
The two sisters spare nothing to take on all the work in their
beloved restaurant, from 7:30 am to 8 pm.
</P>
<P>
"It is a tedious job," said younger Yang Gar, who has a good
dress sense.
</P>
<P>
She said they are able to gain about one thousand yuan (120 US
dollars) in profits in one month during the winter off season,
usually the worst season for business on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
"But the rush summer season can provide fat returns for us,"
she said, claiming they can obtain an average daily turnover worth
5,000-6,000 yuan (roughly 720 US dollars) during the traditional
local horse racing festival.
</P>
<P>
Enlarging their business is their next dream. Their endeavors
will set an example in success for the modern North Tibetan
herdswomen.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Falls to Six-Year Low in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain fell by
45,100 in December to a six-year low of about 1.89 million, or 6.7
percent of the workforce, according to figures released today by
the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The total unemployment fell by 350,800 over last year and has
been on the decline for 10 months in succession.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment diminished in all parts of the country, with the
biggest declines in the South East, West and East Midlands and
South West.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major hailed the fall in
unemployment as a "tonic for the British people."
</P>
<P>
Britain had created more jobs than the major countries of
Europe put together in the past four years, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said that unemployment is falling at a
dangerously fast rate and the government's inflation target will
be threatened and interest rates forced up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Labor Party questioned the figures
today, claiming that the true number of people looking for work is
more than double the official unemployment figures.
</P>
<P>
The party claimed that there were 2.1 million people classed as
"economically inactive" and 209,000 more on training schemes,
which is above the official figures of the two million registered
unemployed.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Israeli-Palestinian Deal on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- France today applauded the
conclusion of a deal between Israel and the Palestinian Authority
on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement was expected for a long time. France hopes that
it will be put into work with the shortest delay," the French
Foreign Ministry said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
After months of arduous negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
initialed the pact early this morning.
</P>
<P>
A chief Palestinian negotiator said the deal guarantees Israeli
pullback from 80 percent of Hebron within 10 days and further
Israeli redeployments in the West Bank over the next 1 1/2
years. The first withdrawal is to be started by March 7.
</P>
<P>
Hailing it as a signal of a new start of the Middle East peace
process, the statement said, "it is advisable now that the other
layouts of the temporary agreement on the autonomy of the West
Bank and Gaza be implemented rapidly."
</P>
<P>
While paying homage to the key brokers of the peace deal, the
United States, Egypt and Jordan, France will "continue to give its
assistance to the implementation of the (Palestinian) autonomy and
the construction of peace" together with its European partners,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian cabinets will convene separately later

<HEADLINE> Mandela Rejects Outside Influence on Arms Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said here today his government would not be
influenced by other countries in dealing with the arms sale
problem.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to American criticism of the proposed
South Africa's 638 million U.S. Dollars weapons deal with Syria,
Mandela told reporters that no country would be allowed to
dictate South Africa on how it ran its affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said western countries should not expect South Africa
to avoid befriending their enemies.
</P>
<P>
On proposed sale of an electronic tank-sighting system to
Syria, Mandela said the cabinet will meet soon to make a decision
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"The decision we will take on the issue will be purely decided
upon in the interests of South Africa, not by the influence of
any other country or government," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman Ricky
Naidoo said on Monday the cabinet conditionally agreed last month
to sell Syria South Africa-made tank firing control systems, but
a final decision will not be made until the end of this January.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said Washington was deeply concerned about the possible
arms sale to Syria, warning it might stop aid to South Africa if
arms deal went ahead.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which has promulgated "Counter Terrorism Act" for
years, warns any country that provide lethal military eqiuipment
to "terrorist countries" will meet U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Syria is on Washington's list of "states that sponsor
terrorism".

<HEADLINE> Japanese Writer Calls For Sino-Japanese Friendship in New Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- An experienced Japanese
political analyst and senior reporter has published a book in
Chinese urging Japan to remember its historical crimes in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiro Honzawa, who was born in 1942, today donated 200 Chinese
versions of his new book "The Big Warning of China" to the Museum
of the War of the Chinese People's Resistance Against Japan.
</P>
<P>
The book, based on interviews with dozens of Chinese and
Japanese people, calls on Japan to develop peaceful and friendly
relations with China, and stop following in the footsteps of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The book warned that militarism will hurt not only Japan, but
also the rest of Asia, including China.
</P>
<P>
Jiro Honzawa, an activist for Sino-Japanese friendship, was at
the Beijing museum today for the fourth time. He has twice
organized Japanese reporters and students to visit the museum,
</P>
<P>
"As a Japanese, it was a very uncomfortable feeling to write the
book," he said at the donating ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"However, enabling many people to read the book is a
cheerful thing," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's school education on its history is not quite
complete," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 copies of the Chinese-version book have been placed
on the market by the China Social Sciences Publishing
House.

<HEADLINE> Missiles Crisis in Cyprus Continues: Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The missiles crisis in Cyprus
cannot be solved unless the Cyprus government gives up an arms
deal to buy Russian-made S-300 missiles, a Turkish Foreign
Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters at a
weekly news briefing that it was not sensible to welcome
Cyprus's decision to postpone the deployment of the 150
kilometers-range missiles on the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department official Carey Cavanaugh said on
Monday night in Nicosia, capital of Cyprus, that Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides had promised not to install the
anti-aircraft missiles worth of 250 million U.S. dollars for the
next 16 months, which the U.S. official believed will ease the
tension on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said that Turkey described the decision Cyprus has
presented to postpone the deployment of the missiles as a
"good-will gesture" or a "positive development."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has responded in this respect and "all our enemies and
friends have got to know Turkey's sensitivity and determination
on the Cyprus issue," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cyprus president denied in Nicosia the report
Tuesday that an agreement had been reached between the Greek
Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on immediate implementation of a
U.N. package of measures aimed at reducing tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh had allegedly said that that President Clerides and
Turkish northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas gave their full
support for "immediate implementation" of the U.N. proposals.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh returned to Turkey's largest city of Istanbul this
morning, following his visits to Cyprus and Greece in a bid of
mediation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. proposals include adoption of military code of
conduct, extension of the unmanning of army posts along the
demarcation line, removal of land mines and unloading weapons
from the posts near the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said that Rauf Denktas will pay a two-day visit to Turkey
between January 20 and 22 at the invitation of Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel to discuss the measures against the
Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish troops
landed and seized the northern third of the island following an
abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots on the island.

<HEADLINE> Main Points of Hebron Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- After months of intensive

last should be completed by March 1998, but no later than mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
The entire West Bank, except Israeli settlements and "military
areas," will be under the Palestinian National Authority's control
after the troop pullbacks, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
On the security in Hebron, the two sides will carry out joint
patrol on the heights overlooking the Jewish enclaves and
establish four joint rapid intervention teams to handle riots and
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Hebron will have 400 Palestinian policemen, equipped with 20
vehicles and armed with 200 pistols and 100 rifles, according to
the accord.

negotiations on the unsolved issues which include a "safe massage"
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Gaza airport and Gaza port.
</P>
<P>
In the accord the Palestinian side promised cooperation to
combat terrorism with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israelis and the Palestinians will give talks on a final peace
agreement within two months, which will define their borders and
the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The nine-page protocol, accompanied by a three-page "note for
the record," is to be discussed by Israeli and Palestinian
cabinets for approval later today. It has to be ratified by the

<HEADLINE> Success Announced in Promoting Basic Education, Eliminating Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 190 million more Chinese
people had access to nine-year compulsory education by the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Former illiterate people aged between 15 to 47 among the vast
army of newly educated could finally read and write.
</P>
<P>
China's State Education Commission (SEC) announced today that
457 more counties, cities and districts across the country have
largely made nine-year compulsory education universal, and wiped
out illiteracy among people aged 15 to 47.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time that the SEC has announced the two goals
being attained by local governments. Over 1,480 of China's
2,853 counties, cities and districts have realized the two goals
set by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Half of China's 1.2 billion people inhabit the 1,482 counties,
cities and districts.
</P>
<P>
An SEC official said that the first phase of making nine-year
compulsory education universal and eliminating illiteracy among
people aged 15 to 47 has been concluded with success. Over 88
percent of all people living in eastern parts of China have
benefited from the plan.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of Chinese people and prevent young
people from becoming illiterate, the SEC decided to make nine-year
compulsory education universal and wipe out illiteracy across the
country by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
According to goals set by the SEC, at least 85 percent of
Chinese people will benefit from basic education. People born
since 1949, when new China was founded, and above the age of 15
are required to be literate by then.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics released by the State Statistics Bureau
show that the illiteracy rate among people aged between 15
to 47 is six percent.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of every 10 Chinese people could not read or write in
1949 when new China was founded. Thanks to unremitting efforts
made by the Chinese government during the past 45 years, China's
illiteracy rate sharply dropped to 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year four million former illiterates became literate.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Agriculture Up By 3.9 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' agriculture
sector registered a growth of 3.9 percent in 1996, a turnaround
from the almost nil growth of 0.15 percent in 1995, Agriculture
Secretary Salvador Escudero said here today.
</P>
<P>
The significant improvement was mainly due to better
performances of rice, sugar cane, hog and chicken subsectors,
which offset the decline of fishery output, Escudero said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He noted that major crops had recovered from 1995's decline and
staged a 4.76-percent increment in the 1996 output.
</P>
<P>
With this turnaround, the country is just starting the journey
towards food self-sufficiency, said Escudero.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agriculture sector is expected to maintain
the same growth rate of 3.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The sector's poor performance in 1995, resulted from frequent
typhoons in the country, brought about a rice crisis and a
double-digit inflation in the last quarter of the year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Makes Donations to Poor Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen hospitals in Shanghai
today issued 1,000 special cards to poor workers, enabling them to
get some free medical treatment and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the most well-off city in China, but it still has
300,000 poor workers living on an income of less than 200
yuan (about 25 dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The lives of the poorer workers is made even harder because the
factories where they work could not pay hospital bills in time.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life started to donate money, or
materials to help the poor workers recently, inspired by the
approaching traditional Chinese Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals promised that card-holders need not pay
registration fees, and they will get 500 yuan-worth's of
medication and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The 14,000 workers in the Shanghai municipal government
departments donated 360,000 yuan to help the poor workers,
including Huang Ju, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party, and mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
The total sum of money collected was equal to the civil
servants' total salary in a day.
</P>
<P>
Local financial institutions also contributed 1.45 million yuan
to help the workers.

MOGADISHU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Journalists in Mogadishu have
called on rival factions here to improve their behaviors towards
them.
</P>
<P>
The Somali Independent Journalist Union (SIJU) has protested
against what it called a continuous intimidation and harassment
posed by the militiamen and supporters of the faction leaders
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Commemorating the first anniversary of its foundation on
Tuesday, the SIJU announced that a number of Somali
journalists have received direct deah threats and are subjected
to foot tracing by the secret servicemen of the warring factions
and imprisonments.
</P>
<P>
The journalists have urged the faction leaders to respect the
intertnational laws and relations concerning the freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual report made by the SIJU, 46 local and
foreign journalists have been killed in Somalia since the civil
war broke out in the country in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The report expressed concern over factional radio broadcasts
which made some journalists white elephants. The union has
appealed to political leaders to exert maximum pressure on their
militiamen and supporters to ensure the free movement of
journalists.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai Announces Plans for Foreign Investors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhuhai, one of China's five
special economic zones (SEZ), hopes to complete State policy
adjustments for the area by luring more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Liang Guangda, secretary of the Zhuhai City Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party and director of the Administration
Committee of the special economic zone, noted that Zhuhai will
give priority to the development of high-tech industries, the
heavy chemical industry, and international ocean transshipment
business using foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
This will make the most of the city's advantageous basic
facilities and environmental protection programs. Additionally,
Zhuhai is adjacent to Macao and has a well-developed port
transport system.
</P>
<P>
Located in the western part of the Pearl River Delta, an
economically-developed area, Zhuhai has used four billion US
dollars in foreign investment since it became a special economic
zone in 1980. Overseas investment has been rising at an annual
rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the overseas funds were spread throughout
the industrial sector. Five percent went toward agricultural and
fishery industries, and the service sector received 25 percent,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
More foreign funds are needed to spur economic development of
Zhuhai, Liang said, as foreign investment for basic facilities
alone is expected to reach five to eight billion US dollars during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).

<TEXT>
<P>
With the inflow of international financial capital into China,
Zhuhai will also give priority to introducing financial capital
instead of industrial capital, by adopting the measure of BOT
(build-operate-transfer), Liang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign business people are encouraged to set up
banking enterprises, investment funds, and insurance companies in
the city.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Zhuhai brought in about 900 million US
dollars of foreign investment last year, a 33 percent rise over
the previous year. By the end of October of 1996, the city had
signed an accumulated 5,644 contracts on utilizing overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that Zhuhai has concentrated on developing basic
facilities, and has completed large projects such as the Zhuhai
deepwater port, Zhuhai Airport, and the Guangzhou-Zhuhai
expressway.
</P>
<P>
Projects still in the preparation stage include the
Guangzhou-Zhuhai express railway, Lingdingyang bridge between
Zhuhai and Hong Kong, and a large-scale power plant with a
generating capacity of 1.32 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Five functional zones have been developed to house large
industrial projects, with a combined coverage of 400 square
kilometers: the Lingang Heavy Chemical Industry Zone, a new
state-level high-tech development zone, the Hongwan Bonded Zone,
an aeronautic town, and the Hengqin Comprehensive Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
"The zones will create a new era for foreign investment, and
are expected to become Zhuhai's new economic development areas,"
Liang said.

The State Council, China's highest governing body, made a
number of adjustments in its use of foreign investment: on April 1
of last year, the duty-free treatment for imported equipment by
foreign-funded businesses was cancelled. Zhuhai also must update
methods of using foreign investment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds are expected to help change Zhuhai's industrial
structure, in which the basic industry, high-tech industry,
modern agriculture, labor- and capital-intensive enterprises
will be the key development areas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuhai city government will alter its procedure of
approving projects to invite investment, Liang noted.
</P>
<P>
Special organizations will be set up by the city government to
attract foreign investment by building an information network and
an intermediary service system for foreign investors, and putting
investment activities into the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Liang said Zhuhai will expand channels to lure foreign
funds. Emphasis will be put on the expansion of markets in
European and American countries and newly industrialized countries
and regions. The city will make the most of its proximity to Macao
to introduce funds from Latin language-speaking countries,
including Italy, Spain, and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 60 percent of direct overseas investment
in Zhuhai is from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and mainly focuses
on labor-intensive enterprises.

<P>
XING'AN, GUANGXI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China today handed
over to a US group of experts the remains of some crew members who
were on board a US B-24 bomber that crashed in south China during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony here, representatives from the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, where the bomber went down, passed on wooden boxes
carrying the remains of the US servicemen to the US team currently
in China to investigate the wreck.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Tingchun, magistrate of Xing'an County, where the
accident occurred, and Alan Liotta, head of the US group, signed a
list of what was handed over to the US group.
</P>
<P>
Liang Ziwei, director of the Foreign Affair Office of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional Government, said that "we are
gratified to send back the remains of the young Americans nearly
half a century after they gave their lives for the cause of peace
and justice."
</P>
<P>
According to Liang, governments at all levels in the region
together with the local people assisted in the search process
and subsequently protecting the remains, out of a desire to honor
the US soldiers and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of US President Bill Clinton, US Secretary
of Defense William Perry, as well as family members of the victims
and all American people, Alan Liotta expressed sincere gratitude
and thanks to the Guangxi government and people for their
humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 50 years ago, these brave Americans
joined together with their Chinese friends to fight a common enemy.
</P>
<P>
"We are here today because that friendship is again allowing us
to return the remains of these crew members to the US," he noted.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Liotta told Xinhua that experts visiting
the crash site yesterday learned the actual conditions of the
area. He added that they would decide whether or when they will
come here again for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
The bomber took off at an airbase in Liuzhou at 4:30 P.M. on
August 31, 1944, on a mission to bomb the Japanese warships. It
crashed on its return journey to the base.
</P>
<P>
Five identification tags of ten servicemen aboard have been
found.

assassination attempt unhurt here Tuesday, the local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the 75-year-old politician left his office here
yesterday morning for the Ota High Court in Ogun State.
</P>
<P>
When his car arrived at the Sura Market near his office, his
driver noticed that another car was trying to overtake them from
behind.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that his driver refused to allow the car to pass,
and then came a hail of bullets on his car.
</P>
<P>
It was later found that altogether eight bullets hit his car.
One pierced the back seat where he was sitting. Another hit the
oil tank. "But thank God, the tank didn't catch fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abraham recalled that the car used by the assassins looked
like a Daewoo Race, but said he was not sure.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that he was told by a woman in the market that the
assassins were in uniforms, though he admitted that he did not see
for himself.
</P>
<P>
He implied that the assassination attempt was done by the
government to silence any opposition in the country, but said he would
not give in.
</P>
<P>
It was only five days ago that the politician said at a press
conference that there was a plan to attempt the live of himself and
the Chairman of his party, Chief Michael Adekunle Ajasin.
</P>
<P>
He even quoted a broadcast of the Radio Kudirat as saying that
the contract to eliminate him and Ajasin was given to the Second
Mechanised Division of the Nigerian Army in Ibadan.
</P>
<P>
Abraham is the fifth public figure under assassination
attempts this year in Nigeria, and the second to survive.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai to Build Across Sea Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The city of Zhuhai in south
China's Guangdong Province plans to build a 27-kilometer-long
bridge over the sea to link itself with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will require 13.4 billion yuan for
construction, is being submitted to the central government for
approval.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Guangda, a city official, work on the
Lingdingyang Bridge will begin in 1998, and is scheduled for
completion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
It will become the mainland's second land outlet to Hong Kong;
the present land throughway is the Lo Wu Pass, a travelers' pass
between Shenzhen City and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Liang disclosed that construction funds will be raised by way
of Sino-overseas cooperation, with possible investors from the
United States, Spain, Australia and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The investment for the project is expected to be recovered
within 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the 31-meter-wide bridge will have six lanes,
and allow motor vehicles to travel at a speed of 120 kilometers
per hour.

<HEADLINE> U.N.-Sponsored Afghan Talks End Without Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the
Afghan Taliban militia and the anti-Taliban alliance ended their
talks here today without any progress, but they pledged to meet
again to try to patch up their differences.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have ended and we have decided to meet again in
February," Mufti Masoon Afghani, Taliban envoy in Islamabad, said
after the two-day U.N.-sponsored talks with the Supreme Council
for the Defense of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. special envoy on Afghanistan Norbert Holl hosted the talks
of Afghan working group as part of his efforts to broker
reconciliation between the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. diplomat described the talks as a "step forward" but
would not raise hopes for any breakthrough. "I can't guarantee any
success unless I see it in reality," he told a news briefing
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams discussed issues ranging from nationwide
ceasefire to demilitarization of Kabul to the establishment of a
broad-based government in their country.
</P>
<P>
Masoon said the Taliban militia, which controls two-thirds of
Afghanistan territory, proposed the formation of a joint
commission to iron out matters relating to truce, exchange of
prisoners and finally the setting up of a strong government.
</P>
<P>
"They insisted on the demilitarization of Kabul which is
illogical demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia overran Kabul last year and pushed the
forces of the ousted government led by Commander Ahmad Shah Masood
to the north.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular rise of the Taliban prompted the rival groups
mainly concentrated in northern provinces to close their ranks.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Taliban and the Supreme Council were
their first-ever contact since the rise of the Taliban militia in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The three-man Taliban side is led by Wakil Ahmad, a close aide
of militia leader Mulla Umar.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban Supreme Council for the Defense of Afghanistan
is represented by Muhammad Ishaq, representative of the ousted
Afghan government, Rasul Talib of Shiite Hezb-i-Wehdat faction led
by Karim Khalili, and Mohammad Painda of northern warlord Rashid
Dostum.

<HEADLINE> More Money Urged for Refugees in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Director of the Mozambican
Center for Supporting Refugees Fernando Fazenda has urged the
international community to provide more aid to refugees in
Mozambique, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal on Tuesday in the Mozambican capital,
saying that his center has not obtained enough money to help the
refugees who are mainly from Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is very difficult to estimate the number of
refugees because most of them, with great mobility, treat
Mozambique as a transfer station to South Africa, the director
noted.
</P>
<P>
As Mozambique is a country with a vast territory, it is hard
to monitor and control refugees in the country for the lack of
money and equipment, he added.

<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The ill-fated Nigerian ADC 086
Flight that crashed near Lagos on November 7, killing all 143
people aboard, may have been sabotaged, the "Daily Champion"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted "well-placed sources in Abuja" as saying
that investigators are now convinced that the Boeing 727 aircraft
was "probably sabotaged".
</P>
<P>
The investigators' fear was supported by several evidences: no
emergency call was recorded by the black box, violent explosions
were reported before the plane dashed into a lagoon near Lagos
and the hull of the plane was blown into pieces, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which took off from Port Harcourt, disappeared from
the radar screen 10 minutes before it was expected to land at the
Murtala Mohammed Airport of Lagos on the afternoon of November 7.
</P>
<P>
Weeks of rescue work on the lagoon about 50 kilometers to the
northeast of Lagos yielded only bits of human bodies and the
plane. Most of the corps and the hull of the plane still lie
abandoned in the water today.
</P>
<P>
The black box of the plane is now in the Boeing Company of the
United States for analysis, according to earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes Measures to Nab Tax Defaulters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa has unveiled new measures to bring defaulting and
delinquent taxpayers into the tax net and provide much-needed
funds for the cash-strapped government.
</P>
<P>
In a move that is expected to reduce
the country's bloated budget deficit, the minister said on
Tuesday that the new measures are necessitated by an
unprecedented number of defaulters who have prejudiced the
cash-strapped Zimbabwe government of millions of Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said the Department of Taxes will with immediate
effect engage itself in an intensive registration exercise for
businesses and companies.
</P>
<P>
"We would also intensify sales tax examinations to speed up
tax collection and curb misuse of sales tax numbers and intensify
pay as you earn (PAYE) audits to speed up remittance of tax to
the department," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other measures will include the field audits to check the
accuracy of accounts and compliance with tax law and enhanced tax
collection and follow-up measures.
</P>
<P>
To ensure success of the program, the minister said penalties
will be levied on all companies and individuals found to be in
default while those who voluntarily approach the department and
make prompt payment will not be liable to such penalties.
</P>
<P>
He said only 33,000 companies are reflected on the
department's records while records from the registrar of
companies show that the country has over 75,000.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, if we assume that we are only covering half the
number of companies, this will translate to 30 to 40 percent of
what we are currently collecting from the companies," he said.

<HEADLINE> Over 60 Chinese Rescued, but 140 others Still Trapped by Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Altay, January 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 people trapped by
heavy snowstorms in a remote mountain range in Xinjiang have been
rescued and transferred to safe areas by the air force.
</P>
<P>
The group were among the 200 people who have been blocked in by
snowstorms since December 28 in the Altay Mountains in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
They had lost all contact with the outside world in Fuyun
County's Haidaqiao, a settlement some 120 km from downtown Altay.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately guards at a frontier station nearby located them
and reported their condition to the government via two way radio.
</P>
<P>
Government departments immediately took urgent measures and
then air-dropped 2.5 tons of food and medicine to the 200 people
on January 6.
</P>
<P>
The government tried to reach the trapped people by highway
traffic, but the efforts failed because of deep snow. Another
seven centimeters of snow fell within a few hours this morning,
adding to the misery.
</P>
<P>
Officials say there are three children and 30 women among the
snow trapped people. The youngest child is one and half year old.
</P>
<P>
Holding the child, Song Wenzhi told Xinhua, ``Had it not been
for the relief operation of the government and the Chinese
Communist Party, the child and I would have died of hunger or
coldness."
</P>
<P>
Two people have been seriously injured by the extreme coldness,
and they have been sent to the Altay Prefectural Hospital for
emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
The rescue work is being made very difficult because of the
continuing snow and severe coldness. The remaining 140 people
still trapped are expected to be rescued tomorrow if things go
smoothly for the rescue team.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone President Tejan
Kabbah ordered Tuesday that rice supply to the army, police and
prisons in the country, which annually imports rice worth 30
million U.S. Dollars, "be dramastically cut down."
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office said today that rice for the army will
fall from 40,000 bags to 17,000 bags, while rice for the police
from 30,000 to 17,000 bags.
</P>
<P>
The prison department will only get 3,000 bags, said the
office.
</P>
<P>
"The president is worried over reports that some senior
military and police officers are collecting bags of rice for
their personal use," an official said.
</P>
<P>
Rice for the security forces, heavily subsidised, is sold for
only 1,000 Leones a bag. And in the open civilian market, a bag
of rice is sold for 23,000 Leones.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone usually imports rice worth 30 million US Dollars
from Burma, China and Pakistan. Rice is the country's staple
food.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Launch "Image War" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The President of the Bank of
China (BOK) on Monday unexpectedly announced that his bank needs
to improve its image.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at BOK's annual meeting, Wang Xuebing said the call
comes at a time when BOK has been steadily losing its market share
in international clearing business and trading to three major
domestic competitors: China Construction Bank (CCB), the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC).
</P>
<P>
Although the bank remains the leader in the field, BOK must
stay on top of the issue, otherwise it will lose in the
increasingly fierce competition, he warned.
</P>
<P>
It seems that BOK's staff have become preoccupied with their
own business, Wang said, ignoring how others, especially their
domestic counterparts, are faring. He also urged BOK's publicity
department to do a better job.
</P>
<P>
Like the BOK head, leaders of other state commercial banks, who
are also meeting this week to discuss strategic issues, are
echoing the warning.
</P>
<P>
In his annual work report to CCB, President Wang Qishan
stressed the fierce competition between domestic banks and their
overseas counterparts that are gradually entering China's banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, CCB has taken some steps to create a new
public image over the past year by instituting a name change,
dropping the word "people's" from the former "People's
Construction Bank of China," mobilizing the staff to donate to a
charity fund sponsored by the CCB, and fulfilling much-publicized
promises to improve service.
</P>
<P>
Compared with its local competitors, CCB has the most
successful advertising campaign: some buses are carrying the
bank's slogans, some local TV channels are broadcasting its ads,
and its public relations staff is maintaining close contact with
the media.
</P>
<P>
At their respective annual meetings this week, ABC President
Shi Jiliang and ICBC's new president Liu Tinghuan have both
concentrated on their publicity campaigns.
</P>
<P>
While these large banks are beginning to realize the importance
of publicity, other smaller ones are quietly waging an image war.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Prosecutors Issue Ultimatum to Strike Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's state prosecutors
today issued an ultimatum to strike leaders ordering them to stop
strikes or face arrest.
</P>
<P>
"If the current illegal action is not halted right away, we
will exercise our prosecution power sternly and resolutely to
maintain national order," Choe Byong-kuk, a prosecutor from the
Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has issued warrants for the arrest of seven
strike leaders, and Choe urged them to surrender to the
prosecution for the sake of law, order and national economy.
</P>
<P>
Choe said police would be employed to carry out the arrest
warrants if the seven leaders, who are now holed up in Myongdong
Cathedral in Seoul, refused to give themselves up to the law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged strikes were damaging not only the country's economy,
but also national security, Choe said, adding that the labor
unrest should be rationally settled within the framework of law
and order.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing nationwide strikes began on December 26 last year
when South Korea's ruling New Korea Party (NKP) railroaded a labor
law through the National Assembly in the absence of opposition
legislators.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, employers may lay off workers to protect
their firms from bankruptcy and use workers at any time within the
boundary of 56 hours per week on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
The massive strikes have already caused an industrial
production loss of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars and an export setback
of 393 million dollars, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said.

<HEADLINE> Poachers Threaten Wild Animals in Northeast S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Armed poachers remain a
serious threat to wild animals in the northeast South African
border areas, South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted a
regional environmentalist as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Louis Olivier, a game ranger in the Kruger National Park, said
protecting wild animals in the park has become a dangerous job as
many poachers are armed with AK47 and other rifles.
</P>
<P>
The Kruger National Park, about 450 km northeast of
Johannesburg, is a two-million-hectare protection area for wild
animals and natural resources between South Africa and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Although 22 anti-poaching units have been patrolling inside
the park day and night, Olivier said, they still found it
difficult to curb the incidence of illegal hunting. Elephants and
Rhinos have been prime targets of the illegal hunting.
</P>
<P>
Experienced poachers are usually accompanied by dogs, which
alert them to the presence of patrols and give them a head start
in pursuit operations, Olivier said, adding recent heavy rains
also make it difficult to track down poachers.

<P>
URUMQI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Entrepreneurs have come to
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China to invest in
animal husbandry as they see immediate profits in something other
than just raising cattle and sheep.
</P>
<P>
A local official says that the region now has more than 100
enterprises from other parts of the country with a total
investment of one billion yuan in animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is the second largest pastoral area, after the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, and has 50 million hectares of
grassland and seven million hectares of land available for
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Its animal husbandry is being expanded and mechanized with the
arrival of these enterprises from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Fangzhou Group, owned by businessmen from
Shenzhen, Hainan Province, and Beijing, is developing an animal
husbandry project near the regional capital of Urumqi.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Join International Convention for  Prevention of Pollution from Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will join the
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships in a move to prevent desludging by ships in the Straits of
Melaka, the Malaysia TV reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's participation in the convention would also allow
its ships to pass through the waters of member countries without
having to undergo checks, the report quoted Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik as saying at the weekly cabinet meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that the Foreign Ministry would be asked to convey
Malaysia's intention to the International Maritime Organization
(IMO).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will officially become a member of the convention
three months after the IMO is informed of its decision, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would seek the agreement of littoral states
like Singapore and Indonesia who are member countries of the
convention to have the Melaka Straits declared as a prohibited
area for desludging.
</P>
<P>
The Straits of Melaka should also be prohibited for ships to
dump oil waste, noxious liquid substances and garbage, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that Malaysia's participation in the convention would
benefit its shipping industry, especially companies handling
tankers.
</P>
<P>
At present, Malaysian tankers entering the waters of member
countries of the convention have to undergo stringent checks and
observe procedures said to be discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities impose charges amounting to 20,000 U.S.
dollars each time a tanker from a non-member country enters its
waters.

HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Two government lots were sold
for a higher-than-expected price of 488 million HK dollars (63
million U.S. dollars) at a public auction held by the Lands
Department of Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
Eton Properties Ltd. bought both sites, which were earmarked
for private residential development.
</P>
<P>
The first site located in Repulse Bay, covering 2,000 square
meters, was sold for 230 million HK dollars (29.8 million
U.S. dollars), with bidding opened at 135 million HK dollars (17.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second lot located in Tuen Mun, the New Territories,
covering 5,000 square meters, was sold for 258 million HK dollars
(33.4 million U.S. dollars), with bidding opened at 130 million HK
dollars (16.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>

they showed the confidence of land developers in the local
property market.
</P>
<P>
Property prices have risen sharply in the past several months

<HEADLINE> Cairo Bus Accident Toll Rises to 39 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Rescue squads managed to find
one more victim today, one day after a public bus fell from a bridge
in Cairo into the Nile River Tuesday, raising the death toll to
39 with at least 29 injured.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bus, with an estimated 70 people on board, had
veered off the Sahel bridge in the Rod al-Farag Street at a
northern suburb of the Egyptian capital, into the muddy shore of
the river flipping over several times before it landed upside
down on the Nile bank.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams pulled out at least 30 bodies entrenched in the
muddy banks, about 20 meters below the bridge. Many of them died
of suffocation or were crushed when the bus fell, said Omar
Banawy, head of the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
"If the bus fell in the water, perhaps more people would have
survived," Banawy told reporters, adding, "The mud makes it
difficult for both the divers and the passengers to get out. Many
people suffocated to death in the mud."
</P>
<P>
He said some passengers jumped out of the bus as it gradually
sank in the river.
</P>
<P>
A mud-covered diver, who volunteered in the rescue, told
Xinhua that about 50 victims were lifted out of the bus two hours
after the tragedy struck. He also plucked up some clothes and
bags belonging to the passengers.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that at least 25 bodies have been
identified by their relatives. The bus driver died in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden the bus veered and crossed the divider in the
middle of the bridge and went into the other lane, narrowly
missing an oncoming taxi. Then it went over," an eyewitness
was quoted by today's Egyptian Gazette as saying.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Tuesday when the bus was crossing the
bridge on its way from the Pyramids area, to Shobra al Kheima,
both overpopulous Cairo suburbs.
</P>
<P>
While some witnesses blamed the tragedy on speeding, a few
others told Xinhua that survivors spotted the driver falling on
the steering wheel and vomiting, when the bus climbed the
bridge. They suspected the driver had a heart attack at that fatal
moment.
</P>
<P>
An urgent assistance money will be offered for the families of
the victims, said Minister of Social Affairs and Insurance Amal
Osman. But he did not elaborate on the aid.

BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China funneled 149 million yuan
(about 18 million US dollars) into the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) in 1996, 12.9 percent more than in 1995, a CASS
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
CASS received 146 million yuan in accordance with the 1996
fiscal budget set by the Ministry of Finance. Another 2.5 million
yuan (about 300,000 US dollars) was added at the end of last year,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
For years, China has greatly increased its financial support to
the nation's top research body of the social sciences, reporting
annual growth in the double digits. The extra funding has been
used to improve research facilities and upgrade living conditions
of the 4,000 CASS employees.
</P>
<P>
CASS poured more money into key research subjects and
accelerated housing construction. The official claimed that they
will add one million yuan (120,000 US dollars) for key projects in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's chief think tank has carried out numerous
research activities and offered suggestions for China's economic
development and cultural progress, both of which are greatly
valued by the Chinese government, a top CASS official said.

MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today reaffirmed his firm stand against seeking reelection as his
six-year term ends in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the Presidential Palace, he
said that Philippine Presidents are "constitutionally barred from
seeking a second term".
</P>
<P>
The president made this remark in response to the
"disappointment" expressed by visiting Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien over his impossibility to run for the Presidency
again.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said he was disappointed that Ramos can not run again
when delivering an opening speech for the Philippines-Canada
Business Forum held today at the Philippine International
Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Prime Minister is on a three-day official visit to
the country, accompanied by a delegation composed of all the
provincial premiers and some 300 top businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"Well I thanked him for his complimentary remarks but I
reminded him that while that may be constitutional in Canada, it
is unconstitutional in the Philippines," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid dictatorship which plagued the country during the
reign of former President Ferdinand Marcos, the 1987 Constitution
sets a single term limit for the President of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A state-sponsored Chinese
language exam held this week in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region was taken by 2,000 people whose native language is not
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
This is the third HSK, or Standard Chinese Language, exam in
the northwestern autonomous region, whose inhabitants are mainly
from the Uygur ethnic minority group.
</P>
<P>
The HSK was originally designed for foreign students who want
to study in China, but was later used in autonomous regions for
the ethnic minority people.
</P>
<P>
Shi Xiaoqun, who is responsible for teaching Chinese language
in the region, said that the move can improve the language
abilities of the ethnic minority people and better allow them to
compete with the Han Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are classified in 56 ethnic groups, more than 90
percent of whom are from the Han ethnic group and the others from
ethnic minorities. The official Chinese language is "putonghua",
or "mandarin Chinese".
</P>
<P>
Shi said that the region will make a greater effort to spread
the use of standard Chinese, not only in universities, but also in
high school and primary school.

<P>
TOKYO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda Tuesday expressed Japan's full support for the
presence of 100,000 American troops in the Asian and Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister made the statement when he met with
visiting the chairman of the House of Representatives' National
Security Committee, Floyd Spence.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military presence, mainly in Japan's Okinawa Island, has
been opposed by the island prefecture's governor Masahide Ota who
repeatedly demanded a cut in U.S military presence. But the
Japanese government has never made such a demand.
</P>
<P>
Ota has decided to visit U.S. in April to make the demand
directly to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
He has for long insisted on a U.S. military withdrawal, arguing
that the concentration of U.S. military facilities on the island
infringes on their constitutional rights to live in peace and
local landowners' property rights.
</P>
<P>
Surges of public outcry over the U.S. military presence in
Okinawa swept across Japan after the rape of a 12-year-old local
schoolgirl in September 1995 by three U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of the Japanese land used by the U.S. military
is concentrated in Okinawa, about 1,600 kilometers southwest of
Tokyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The technical control
department of China's leading industrial city recently found that
80 percent of the imported electric flasks are below standard.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Technical Supervision Department conducted a large
quality-control check in the fourth quarter of last year and
discovered that, of 431 different products, 33 percent were
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Officials involved in the check said that the substandard
products fell short of the country's mandatory standards and
specifications for rating, instructions, electric wiring, and
technical structure.
</P>
<P>
Other low-quality products were glass tea sets, wooden
furniture, and gas-leak alarms.
</P>
<P>
But digit-controlled machine tools, copper tubing, and other
items were singled out for their quality ratings of up to 100
percent.

<HEADLINE> Advertisements Imbue Hearts of Dalian Residents with Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Traditional street adverts for
cigarettes, alcohol and garments, are being replaced in a Chinese
city by messages to foster love and civility among its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The hard-sell advertisements once filled up every corner of port
city Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Now 'love your neighborhood' adverts encourage local residents
to cherish and protect lawns, pigeons on public squares, to save
water and to be good citizens.
</P>
<P>
Many locals have accepted the sentiments expressed in the
messages, and have responded by involving themselves in public
welfare duties.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dalian launched a help-the-poor project in 1995 and
in the same year Dalian TV Station made an advertisement
encouraging better-off people to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
So far, 230,000 people have involved themselves in the help
program and have forged contacts with 25,000 people who have
difficulties. The project has received more than 13 million yuan
in donations and a 40 million-yuan strong help-the-poor fund has
also been established.
</P>
<P>
There are also many advertisements featuring new developments
in Dalian city, while others have a patriotic content.
</P>
<P>
Some local residents said that they feel proud to be citizens
of Dalian when they see such advertising.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Marine
Department said that the 11.24 percent fall in vessels registered
on the Hong Kong register in 1996 was not caused by anxiety over
Hong Kong's handover to China, according to today's South China
Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Director of the department Ian Dale was quoted as saying that
many shipowners had expressed confidence in Hong Kong's future and
a couple of large vessels would be registered in the territory
before the transfer on June 30.
</P>
<P>
An assistant marine director said that the decline was due
mainly to commercial decisions, noting that it was normal for
there to be fluctuations in the annual total.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong shipping register reported 7.9 million gross
registered tons (GRT) last year compared with 8.9 million GRT in

<HEADLINE> Waterway Transport Volume Hits One Billion Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China now has 4,300 waterway
transport enterprises, 360,000 ships and boats for civilian use,
and can ship one billion tons of cargo by water each year.
</P>
<P>
Information from the China Classification Society (CCS) shows
that Chinese ships, with combined dead weight of 22 million tons,
sail through 1,100 ports in 150 countries and regions. China now
ranks among the world's top four countries for its fleet of
container ships.
</P>
<P>
An independent legal entity since 1986, CCS has been engaged in
numerous business activities. So far, it has published 37 various
regulations involving 37 types of ships and facilities on the sea.
</P>
<P>
China presently has 1,200 ship classification survey
organizations spread throughout 1,000 Chinese and overseas
ports. CCS now has 1,800 ships, with aggregate dead weight tonnage
of 15 million.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the Chinese government has authorized CCS to carry
out certification work according to the "International Rules on
Safety Management" created for ships flying the Chinese flag.
</P>
<P>
CCS joined the International Association of Classification
Societies (IACS) in 1988, and is the group's youngest member. It
took the post of chairmanship of IACS in 1996, and has obtained
the Quality System Certificate of Conformity issued by the IACS.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Institute of London Underwriters determined that
ships classified by the CCS are eligible for preferential tariff
treatment for cargo insurance.

<HEADLINE> 34 Dead, 18 Injured, 4 Missing in Xinjiang's Snowstorms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowstorms in three
prefectures of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
since December have resulted in a number of casualties and heavy
economic losses, according to the latest report by the Ministry of
Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
So far, 34 people are reported dead, 18 seriously injured and
four are missing, the report says. The snows have affected a total
of 320,000 local residents, mostly farmers and herdsmen, in Altay,
Bayingolin and Ili prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the storms are responsible for the deaths of 98,700
head of livestock, and destroyed a large number of houses, the
report says. Economic losses are estimated at 247 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes the disastrous snowstorms to the
unexpected early arrival of the winter season, one month earlier
than in most years; the record snowfall, seven-10 times of the
average; the low temperature, down to -36.6 degrees Centigrade;
and the heavy accumulation of snow in parts of the area.
</P>
<P>
The report quotes local weather forecasters as saying that
these hard-hit regions are likely to have more snow in the days to
come.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have taken measures to rescue the victims and
army helicopters have been sent to air-drop relief goods and to
search for missing people. So far, the regional government has
allocated three million yuan for the rescue work.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Denies Arms Deal With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African Foreign
Ministry denied that it has a contract with Syria over a
three-billion-Rand (638 million U.S. Dollars ) arms sale.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what has been reported publicly, no contract to
sell any defence equipment to Syria exists," South African
Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the National Conventional Arms Control Committee nor the
cabinet has taken any decision that a contract be granted to South
African companies to export such defence equipment to Syria,"
the South African Press Association said today, quoting the
foreing ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Denel, South Africa's arms manufacturing
conglomerate, confirmed it had received explicit
permission from the government to start a marketing program for
South African arms in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Denel spokesman Paul Holtzhausen said in Pretoria that his
company has to get permission from the Conventional Arms
Control Commission when starting any arms sale in a foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
Denel, formed in the early 1990's, is a private company but
controls the arms industry of the country through state-run
Armscor.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman Ricky
Naidoo said Monday the cabinet conditionally approved of sales of
South Africa-made tank firing control systems to Syria on
December 4, but a final decision would not be made until the end
of January.
</P>
<P>
U.S State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said Monday that
Washington is deeply concerned about the possible arms sale to
Syria, warning it might stop aid to South Africa if the arms deal
goes.
</P>
<P>
Israel's acting chief of mission in Pretoria Victor warned
when meeting with senior South African diplomats that the planned
arms sale would seriously hamper Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's National Party and Democratic Party have also
voiced disagreement on the deal, saying the event would damage
Mid-East peace process and the interests of South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Inmarsat Helps Improve Telecom in China's Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- International Mobile Satellite
Organization (Inmarsat) is now working on several programs to
improve telecommunications in rural, remote and backward areas in
China.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a seminar in Beijing from January
14-15 to mark the third anniversary of the opening of the Inmarsat
China Resident Office.
</P>
<P>
Inmarsat is an inter-governmental body founded in
1979. Headquartered in London, it has a total of 79 member states
to date, according to its Chief Representative to China, Frances
Choi.
</P>
<P>
The international organization is now cooperating with Chinese
ministries and local governments of Guizhou and Yunnan provinces
to improve local telecommunicational facilities, Choi told the
seminar participants.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between Inmarsat and China has great prospects,
Choi said, noting that his organization is looking for talented
people and able institutions that can successfully carry out the
work in the out-of-the-way areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Inmarsat's goal in China is in line with the country's national
development plans and its current poverty-eradication programs,
Choi noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 years, he said, Inmarsat has evolved from a
maritime satellite communications service operator to a global
personal mobile satellite operator serving clients on sea, air and
land.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Inmarsat had more than 700,000 clients.
</P>
<P>
The Inmarsat China Resident Office is the only one of its kind
opened by the organization in a member country. Its Chinese
programs are seen as models for programs to be launched in other
countries, especially those in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Grain Shortage Looms in Eastern Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Grain shortage crisis in
eastern Kenya looms huge and 11 lawmakers from there have called
on the government to declare the region a disaster-hit zone so as
for it to get immediate assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The hunger situation in parts of Northeastern Province is
getting out of hand since the famine relief food is not
adequate," these lawmakers, from both the ruling Kenya National
African Union (KANU) and the oppositions, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said they are "scared" of going to their
constituencies for fear of witnessing people dying of hunger.
Most of the livestock which people rely on are dead due to
drought and famine in Eastern and Northeastern provinces, they
added.
</P>
<P>
A report issued recently by the Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development said that erratic rains in last April when the
growing season in Kenya started, adversely affected early planted
crops there.
</P>
<P>
The overall cereal production is at 3.8 million for the
1996/97 marketing year while the total consumption demands reach
4.5 million tons in the eastern African country, the report
estimated.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's import requirements for 1996/97 are predicted by the
report at 674,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Relief sources said that partial failure of the annual short
rains last November and December in northeastern Kenya made a
relief operation essential.
</P>
<P>
Mike Sackett, Director of the World Food Program (WFP) to
Kenya said last week that "The situation in 1997 is the most
serious since the 1992/93 drought. If the next rains in March and
April fail, we have big problems."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government formally requested donor assistance
earlier this month following months of increase of food prices
and rates of malnutrition and infant mortality in northeastern
Kenya due to drought.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 500,000 people in Northeastern and
Northern provinces are set to benefit from a 12.4 million U.S.
Dollars foreign food donation in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The donation follows an appeal by the WFP which has asked
donors for buying 25,000 tons of maize, beans and vegetable oil
to feed the people living in drought-stricken areas in Kenya.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Production Reaching Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China pumped 156.45 million
tons of crude oil in 1996, eight million tons more than in the
previous year, according to Zhou Yongkang, president of the China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
Zhou said today at the opening of a CNPC working conference
that China's onshore oil and gas output reached 141.41 million
tons and 16.44 billion cu m last year, an all-time high. The
long-established oil fields in the east, headed by Daqing,
accounted for 80 percent of the country's total crude.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the oilfields in the east were able
to stabilize production and enhance their crude extraction rate by
taking advantage of steady exploration and development.
</P>
<P>
Daqing, China's largest oilfield, produced 56 million tons of
oil in the past year. Shengli, the second largest oilfield, pumped
29.1 million tons. And Liaohe, the third largest, turned out 15
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, other oilfields in the east, including Jilin, Huabei,
Dagang, Zhongyuan, Henan, Jiangsu and Jianghan, produced as much
crude as last year, or posted slight increases.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration and production in the west, where the three
oil-bearing basins of Tarim, Turpan-Hami and Junggar are located,
reported good results over the past year, with total oil output
hitting 15.4 million tons, an increase of 2.56 million tons over
1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Tarim developed an annual crude production
capacity of 4.3 million tons. Junggar discovered three large-scale
oilfields with reserves ranging from 50-100 million tons. The
Turpan-Hami basin discovered a rich oil-bearing structure with a
reserve estimated at more than 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a group of large-scale natural gas fields were
found in the eastern part of southwest China's Sichuan Province,
the central part of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, and in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC president added that remarkable progress was made in
Sino-foreign onshore oil cooperation last year. The CNPC signed 30
oil contracts with foreign oil companies, covering a total
contracted area of 206,000 sq km.
</P>
<P>
CNPC also made headway in its oil exploration and production in
Peru, Thailand and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The official said he expects the country's crude output to hit
between 165-167 million tons this year, an increase of 4.2 to 4.5
percent over the 1996 figure.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan Seek Settlement on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Sahabzada Yakub Khan arrived here this morning trying to work
out a settlement on the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival in the airport, the Pakistani
official said at a press conference that Pakistan does not
recognize as the legitimate government of Afghanistan neither
Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist militia nor Burhanuddin
Rabbani, head of the deposed government.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Pakistani foreign minister said that he would
exchange views with Iranian officials on many subjects of common
interest, including Afghanistan and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides would discuss the issue of the
formation of a broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
As to Iran's proposal of inviting Taliban to Tehran for peace
negotiations, Khan termed the Iranian invitation as "a good idea."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We believe contact between all groups are to be
encouraged and Iran is welcomed to play an important part in
this respect. We will discuss how we can help."
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Khan is expected to hold talks
with Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati and Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
"I am here under instruction to fortify relations with Iran
on behalf my prime minister, president and the people of
Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "Pakistan has strong bonds with Iran which are
destined to grow."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Leghari earlier emphasized the
need for closer coordination with Iran for an "equitable"
settlement on Afghanistan, giving representation to major ethnic
and influential groups there.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati today called Khan as his
old friend, saying that Iran and Pakistan have much in common.
</P>
<P>
"We will have talks on Afghanistan which have a lot of
tragedies, including Soviet occupation and civil war," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Pakistan will try to have a joint
agreement on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed "the internal affairs of Afghanistan
should be resolved by its own people. But as neighbors, we can not
be indifferent."
</P>
<P>
The Tehran meeting between Pakistani and Iranian foreign
ministers is a follow-up to their recent contacts in Turkey and
Indonesia during multilateral meetings of Islamic countries last
year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is reportedly sympathetic to the Taliban militia
which seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, on September 27, driving
out the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Kabul is considered as a major setback in Iran's
foreign policy. As a result, the relations between Iran and
Pakistan were getting cooler since then.
</P>
<P>
Iran alleged the Taliban as a hand-raised group which has
flourished as a result of U.S. planning, Saudi financial support
and Pakistan's logistics backing.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the deposed government, which allied
with the faction of northern Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam
after losing Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has continued in north of Kabul between the Taliban
and the alliance opposing it, with clashes also reported between
Taliban and its rivals in the northwestern region in the
vicinity of Dostam's base.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu voiced their
thanks today to King Hussein of Jordan for his efforts to help
conclude the Hebron agreement, Jordan Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
This came when the Jordanian king received telephone calls
from the two leaders this morning following the initialing
of the accord in the early hours of today.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein congratulated the Palestinian and Israeli peoples
on the singing of the deal, stressing that it was a new
achievement toward establishing trust and peace on the basis of
pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators initialed the deal
early this morning behind close doors on the border between Israel
and the Gaza Strip at a summit between Arafat and Netanyahu in the
presence of the U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will hand over most of Hebron to
Palestinian self-rule within 10 days of the signing.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came Sunday after the Jordanian monarch
launched an intense effort in Gaza and Tel Aviv for meeting with
Arafat and Netanyahu to save the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations
on Israel's troop withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Shimon Shamir, Israeli Ambassador to Jordan said that King
Hussein, who returned home Monday, played an "extremely vital"
role in the process.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Bar British Nuclear Waste Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today decided to
ban the British ship, Pacific Teal, carrying recycled nuclear
waste from France to Japan from using its waterways and Economic
Exclusive Zone.
</P>
<P>
Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding
announced here the decision to bar the Pacific Teal was made by
the Cabinet at its weekly meeting today.
</P>
<P>
"The Cabinet is very concerned over this matter and took the
decision to ensure the health and safety of the people," he told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the Foreign Ministry had been directed to seek an
assurance from the Japanese government that the ship would not use
waterways under Malaysian control.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Pacific Teal left the French port of
Cherbourg recently apparently en route to round the Cape of Good
Hope at the southern tip of Africa into the Indian Ocean. The
route could take the ship into the Straits of Melaka.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and through the local Atomic Energy Licensing Act, has the legal
right to control the movement of any nuclear material within its
national jurisdiction, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said his government was concerned about a possible mishap
involving the Pacific Teal in the Straits of Melaka as the
waterway is very narrow and congested with about 150 ships using
it daily.

Taking a cue from Philippine President Fidel Ramos' campaign
against graft and corruption, the office said, it was processing
17,914 criminal and administrative cases involving thousands of
state personnel including top government officials.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17,914 cases, 5,849 were received during the last

One of the objectives of the program, it said, is to revive old
Filipino values and traditions as a sensible formula to prevent
graft and corruption.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- More and more German
companies are realizing that Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland
are tomorrow's economic centers, said Corinna Printzen, director
of the Association of German Toy Industries, here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on the Toys Fair held at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center from January 14 to 17,
Printzen said that many of the German toy companies are now making
efforts to enhance their presence in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She said that for the third time in a row, German toy
manufacturers are taking part in the Hong Kong Toys and Games Fair
in the form of a group participation sponsored by the German
Federal Ministry of Economics.
</P>
<P>
She said that the development of the Hong Kong's Toys Fair with
last year's overwhelming success in business orders and an
increasing number of exhibitors and buyers has now attracted 24
German toy manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
She said that the 24 exhibiting companies are presenting their
top quality toys in an area of almost 300 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong is a gateway to the Chinese mainland, she said,
there are more German manufacturers which are waiting for the
enlargement of the exhibition center.
</P>
<P>
According to the Association of German Toy Industries, toy
production in German reached 2.26 billion German marks (1.41
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Printzen said that toy exports further recovered since the
beginning of 1996 and the half-year value rose 4.9 percent over
the same period in 1995.

Tuesday, is to appear before a parliamentary sub-committee today
on accused tax evasion by URC.
</P>
<P>
Enos Tumusiime, the URC managing director, rushed to the
parliament when hearing Kabaseke's arrest. Tumusiime then was told that
Kabaseke had committed "a serious offence for lying to the

<P>
Kabaseke, involved in an accused tax dodge of 500,000 U.S.
Dollars by URC through fuel smuggling, has admitted knowledge of
the case, local media said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabaseke claimed that his principal internal adutor is
responsible for all oil proceeds of URC.
</P>
<P>
He was reported to evade questions three times in a month.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said the Uganda Revenue Authority has evidence
that URC was involved in the case, but it is not clear why URC
bosses have not yet been charged.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Moves Towards Freer Money Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The announcement by Thailand's
central bank to ease foreign ownership restrictions in local banks
signals a shift in thinking, as for years the bank has guarded
local banks from increases in foreign ownership levels.
</P>
<P>
Early this week the Bank of Thailand said it was set to ease
foreign ownership in local banks, from 25 percent to as high as 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Governor Rerngchai Marakanond said the bank was
making a study and will soon determine an appropriate level of
foreign ownership in local commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was initially aimed at attracting investors to
rehabilitate financially-troubled banks only, but Rerngchai moved
to free up the entire market.
</P>
<P>
The new limits will enable local banks to welcome new
shareholders which are required by the central bank to be large
players by international standards.
</P>
<P>
The new shareholders will also bring in know-how, technology
and expertise to internationalize local banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector is one of Thailand's most heavily
protected. The central bank had always said that the market was
simply not ready for larger foreign penetration.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan said the new move is designed
to attract additional long-term investment to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Not only will the banking sector welcome more investment, but
long-term investment will also flow to other sectors," Amnuay
said.
</P>
<P>
The change in foreign ownership limits is part of the efforts
by the central bank to promote vigorous competition.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that behind the move was also the central bank's
desire to globalize Thailand's banking industry in preparation for
a more open financial sector under the World Trade Organization
(WTO) free-trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
Some stock analysts hailed the move, believing that it will
benefit the entire economy, because competitiveness among local
financial institutions will increase and finally consumers will
benefit.

<HEADLINE> Senior Jordanian Official on Signing of Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The signing of the Hebron
agreement is a big stride on the road to put the peace process
back on track and to start a new phase, Jordanian Information
Minister Marwan Muasher said here today.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the accord will help start a new phase that will
lead to a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region, Jordan
Radio quoted Muasher as saying.
</P>
<P>
There is still a lot of work to be done as the Middle East
peace process will witness new trend which will spur the
Palestinian and Israeli sides to implement the signed agreements,
Muasher said.
</P>
<P>
In his telephone calls with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu this morning, King
Hussein of Jordan congratulated the Palestinian and Israeli
peoples on the signing of the deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was the new achievement toward establishing
trust and peace between the Palestinians and Israelis on the
basis of pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After months of intensive negotiations, the Israelis and
Palestinians finally concluded the agreement in the early hours of
this morning on the Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Shai Bazak, media adviser for Netanyahu, told reporters at
the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip that the
accord was initialed at around 2:15 a.m. local time (0015GMT).
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a 40-minute summit between
Netanyahu and Arafat, with the participation of U.S. and European
mediators.
</P>
<P>
Bazak said that during the meeting, phone calls were made to
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Hussein who played an important role in bringing the latest
breakthrough in the Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army radio estimated that after the signing of the
accord, the implementation of the redeployment could be started
at as early as Friday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Cabinets to Discuss Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet is
scheduled to discuss the newly-reached Hebron deal later today as
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is expected to firmly persuade
hard members into accepting it.
</P>
<P>
The deal on Israeli troops pullback from the West Bank town of
Hebron was reached on the Erez crossing between Israel and the
Gaza Strip early this morning after a summit between Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Seven of Netanyahu's 18 cabinet ministers have threatened to
vote against the deal, saying it is "unfair" to some Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The accord will be present to the Israeli Knesset (parliament)
for approval Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian cabinet is also to discuss the deal later today.
</P>
<P>
No details of the deal was revealed from the official sides
after the closed-door dawn session.
</P>
<P>
But local newspapers and well-informed sources have given an
unconfirmed version of the time-table for peace process after the
deal, expecting Israeli troop withdrawal from most of the Hebron
city immediately after the approval of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops would also pull out from West Bank rural areas
in three phases: within six weeks of the signing of the deal,
eight months later, and in August 1998, finally leaving all the
West Bank under PNA's control except Israeli settlements and the
"military areas," according to the unconfirmed time-table.

<HEADLINE> Zambia To Co-op With Other Countries To Crack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia decided to continue to
join hands with other countries to crack down drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The stand was reiterated by Zambia Drug Enforcement Commission
 (DEC) Spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani when he confirmed on Tuesday the
arrest of a Zambian in Namibia for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Sinyani said, ''We shalll continue supporting our colleagues
fighting drug trafficking in other countries and shall not support
any Zambian caught trafficking in drugs abroad.''
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''Until Zambians realize the danger of drug trafficking,
Zambia's name abroad will continue to be tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
A Zambian named Henry Fanwell Mutiti was arrested by the Namibian
police drugs subdivision on December 12 last year when he was found
with 240 tablets of mandrax.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking and abuse are getting rampant in this southern
African country. A total of 1,529 Zambians were arrested locally and
another 22 were arrested in foreign countries last year for drug
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Government Plans to Deepen Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian United Front
government plans to deepen the economic reforms in 1997 in a bid
to achieve sustained and rapid economic development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda is understood to have given Finance
Minister P. Chidambaram the green signal to go ahead with further
liberalizing the economy in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Some sectors that could be included by fresh doses of
liberalization are insurance, banking, pharmaceuticals, roads and
ports, and railways, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to announce a series of measures in
the next few days for capital market revival to further deregulate
the economy and lift credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made by Prime Minister Gowda to
industrialists at a long meeting here on the eve of New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
The industrialists came out of the marathon meeting with a
"strong sense" of satisfaction that the government would be taking
some firm decisions very soon to quicken economic reforms this
year.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the industrialists demanded immediate steps for
reviving depressed capital markets, reduction of government equity
to below 50 percent in public sector units, lower interest rates,
easy availability of credit from banks and financial institutions,
full convertibility of rupee in two years, tax exemption on
dividends and increase in savings rate.
</P>
<P>
In order to show its determination to speed up the economic
reforms, the union cabinet on the eve of the new year gave its
assent to a new list of industries whereby joint ventures with up
to 74 percent foreign equity would be cleared automatically.
</P>
<P>
The list includes manufacturing and infrastructure sectors like
construction and power generation and transmission.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Chathuranan Mishra said that the
government in the new year would take steps to raise productivity
in agriculture through irrigation and high yield variety seeds and
make power generation more efficient for the agriculture sector so
as to cut down subsidies.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram called here for
more reforms, favorable investment climate and more consensus to
attract private and foreign investors for building the country's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, investment requirement for
infrastructure is estimated at between 150 and 200 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Succeeds in Curbing Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province achieved a significant victory in curbing inflation last
year, while maintaining a double-digit growth in its economy.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index of Guangdong rose 4.4 percent in 1996,
far below the nine percent target the province expected at the
beginning of the year and the 6 percent national average for the
year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the growth rate of the gross domestic
product was expected to hit 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The success is remarkable since the inflation rate stood at
18.9 percent in 1994 and 11.6 percent in 1995, said Liu Weiming,
vice-governor of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The vice-governor said that progress made in toning down
inflation represented a "soft landing" for Guangdong, which is
now on a stable course.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that industrial and agricultural output
recorded a rise of 18 percent and 4.5 percent respectively. Local
revenues were up 12 percent and sales volume of social commodities
climbed 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu attributed the slowdown of inflation to efforts by local
governments and authorities which kept close watch on grain,
medicine, chemical fertilizer and electricity prices.
</P>
<P>
It also cancelled a number of exorbitant charges to ease
inflationary pressures. A total of 3,013 fees were modified to
free up about 1.3 billion yuan for local citizens and
enterprises, the vice-provincial governor said.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Thought To Have Been Covered by Tropical Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists say they
believe that the eastern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in China's northwest was covered by tropical forests 30
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists based their analysis on the discovery of a
complete fossilized skeleton of a giant rhinoceros, and the
fossilized remains of two turtles, Beijing's Guangming Daily
newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
Experts regard the giant rhino as the largest land mammal ever
to have existed on earth. Its existence along with the turtles
proves that the Turpan Basin in eastern Xinjiang was suited to the
existence of herbivorous mammals and reptiles some 30 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The movement of the Himalaya Mountains, however, changed the
climatic circumstances of inland parts of Asia, turning them into
dry land, and causing the sprawling lakes, forests, and grasslands
to vanish, and along with them the giant rhinos.
</P>
<P>
The fossilized rhino skeleton was discovered in January 1993,
and is being reconstructed in a museum. The 10-m-long, four-m-tall
skeleton is expected to be on display for the public soon.

<HEADLINE> NZ Disappointed at British Ship's Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand expressed its
disappointment today at the route of a British ship carrying
nuclear waste which will travel near NZ on its way to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Don Mckinnon said that "we made it clear to
Japan and to the other countries involved in the shipment that New
Zealand did not want it to come anywhere near us."
</P>
<P>
"Despite our representations and those of other South Pacific
countries, the vessel will be passing through our region," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Pacific Teal, reported left France today, carrying
highly radioactive plutonium waste. It will pass the south-west
Pacific before arriving in Japan in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Labor Party has urged the government
to make a strong response to the voyage. It warned of the danger
that the Pacific region would become a route of nuclear waste
shipment in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> China's Shanghai Port Handling More Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ports of entry in Shanghai,
China's largest business center, handled a total of 1.658 million
TEUs of containers in 1996, up 29.2 percent from 1995, recent
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports through the ports amounted to 12.49 million
tons, an increase of 22.1 percent over 1995, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is accelerating the pace of turning into an
international shipping center, intending to develop both the
domestic and overseas market.
</P>
<P>
Part of this effort will go into linking its ports with
railways and ocean shipping routes of nearby Jiangsu Province, an
economically-developed part of east China, to attract the
province's imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
The joint transport business has also been expanded to include
Anhui Province, also in east China, and is expected to stretch to
other inland provinces, Shanghai's port authorities say.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 ports of entry from 12 countries now ship cargo
via Shanghai, according to the authorities.

<HEADLINE> US Fund Managers Looking for Wiser Investment In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A team of visiting American
fund managers plan to increase investment in the securities and
real estate sector in China and the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and coastal parts of Chinese China will be their
first choice, with investment focusing primarily on private
ventures in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The business delegation arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday to
attend a high-level conference on investment in the Asia-Pacific
Area. It was led by the State of California's Secretary of
Treasury Matt Fong who said, "The fund managers will explore more
investment opportunities based on first-hand knowledge of China's
political and economic environment."
</P>
<P>
The delegates handle seven retirement funds for government
employees, valued at 234 billion US dollars, and are looking for
greater investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
A fund for retired civil servants in the State of California
became a trend-setter when it announced last December that it
would channel as much as 225 million US dollars into Asian
countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
The team has started its eight-day visit in Hong Kong,
Guangzhou, and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Probe Ordered Against Indian Agents in Ship Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
ordered an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
against the Indian travel agents who were involved in the illegal
immigration of over 200 Indians most of whom died in the "killer
ship" tragedy near the Mediterranean close to Malta recently.
</P>
<P>
The probe has been ordered following a report from Indian
Ambassador in Athens Gurdip Singh Bedi, who said that gullible
peasants had fallen prey to unscrupulous travel agents in Delhi,
capital of India, and different towns in Punjab state.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the External Affairs Ministry has said that the
Indian travel agents had taken 250,000 rupees (7,042.25 U.S.
dollars) per person for the illegal immigration on the promise of
a job in Italy and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Little did the peasants realize that their dream for
high-salaried jobs would end in icy waters near the Greek coast
when they first set out from India in small batches. Some on
genuine and others on forged documents left for Alexandria in
Egypt or Istanbul in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Indian ambassador's report paints a grim picture of the
exploitation of the peasants by travel agents in Delhi and Punjab
state who had organized the odyssey which ended in tragedy
probably on December 25 last year. Each of the intending
immigrants, it is understood, had shelled out a heavy amount on
the promise they would be escorted safely up to the Italian coast.

<HEADLINE> China, Equatorial Guinea Seek Close Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALABO, Equatorial Guinea, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China and
Equatorial Guinea signed an agreement on economic and
technological cooperation here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and Equatorial Guinean minister of State for
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Miguel Oyono Ndong Mifumu.
</P>
<P>
Both expressed satisfaction over the trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries based on equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Oyono spoke highly of China's constant
support for the social and economic development in Equatorial
Guinea since the two countries set up diplomatic relations in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Qian's visit showed China's concern and support for Equatorial
Guinea, Oyono said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his country upholds an independent and
non-aligned policy and opposes any interference by one country
with the internal affairs of another under the pretext of
providing aid. It also opposes the imposition by a country of its
political system and value concepts upon others.
</P>
<P>
Oyono emphasized that his country backs China's efforts to
preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity and reunify the
country.
</P>
<P>
Qian praised the Equatorial Guinean government for its "one
China" policy and its position not to have official relations with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China and Equatorial Guinea are both developing countries and
they share identical or similar views on many important
international issues, Qian said. They always understand each
other, sympathize with each other and support each other in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is the highest ranking Chinese official to visit this
African nation, appreciated the positive role Equatorial Guinea
has played and efforts it has made in African affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to further enhance cooperation with Equatorial
Guinea in international affairs, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said China is also willing to encourage Chinese businessmen
to come to Equatorial Guinea for cooperation of various forms with
local businessmen. Both sides have said there are good prospects
for economic cooperation and bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who came here Tuesday for a one-day visit, had met
Equatorial Guinean President Teodora Obiang Nguema Mbasego and
Prime Minister Angeleserafin Seriche Dougan.

<HEADLINE> Gil-Robles Voted European Parliament President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament on
Tuesday elected Spanish Partido Popular member, Jose-Maria
Gil-Robles Gil Delgado, as its new president to replace German
Socialist Klaus Haensch.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament also elected 14 vice-presidents and
46-year-old Julian Priestly as its new secretary-general to
replace Enrico Vinci, the current secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Gil-Robles' election, by 338 votes to 177 for the only other
contender, France's Catherine Lalumiere, who won a surprisingly
large protest vote, came as no surprise after a deal between the
EU assembly's two biggest political groups.
</P>
<P>
Under a long-standing deal the Socialists and mainly Christian
Democrat European People's Party share the presidency of the
parliament's five-year legislature.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Pasty, the leader of the assembly's third biggest
group -- the Union for Europe -- told Gil-Robles he should take
steps to wipe out this monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The election had worsened the lack of democracy the parliament
regularly complained about in the other EU institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gil-Robles said he would carry on fighting for democracy. The
reserved, 61-year-old lawyer from Madrid has been a member of the
parliament since 1989, serving on committees dealing with rules,
institutions and petitions governing the technicalities and
legalities of parliamentary life.
</P>
<P>
As president of the parliament he will hold the reins in the
closing stages of the inter-governmental conference on revising
the EU's Maastricht Treaty in which the parliament, the EU's
directly elected assembly, is lobbying for more powers.
</P>
<P>
He will inherit from his predecessor Klaus Haensch, a German
Socialist, one of the thorniest issues facing the parliament --
unequal salaries earned by deputies from different member states
and the consequent abuse of expenses and perks.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia and its Chechen republic
signed a provisional agreement today on cooperation in exchanging
information on criminals.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after a meeting in Moscow between Russian
Interior Affairs Minister Anatoly Kulikov and Chechen Interior
Minister Kazbek Makhashev.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers signed the accord at a time when public order
in Chechnya is deteriorating as Russian troops withdraw from the
republic and the Chechen general election approaches.
</P>
<P>
The provisional agreement will effectively prevent criminals in
Chechnya from proliferating outside the republic, and improve
public order in the whole Northern Caucasian area, Kulikov said
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that both sides cooperate without
political influences, Kulikov noted. He said there was no
contradiction between the federal government and the Chechen
authorities over anti-criminal activity.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is strengthening its
check on ostrich products from South Africa for fear that these
products may carry ticks bearing a virus that can cause fatal
haemorrhagic fever, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives has ordered
checkpoints to examine items imported by businessmen and tourists
from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ministry said that although Thailand did not
import ostriches from South Africa, but souvenirs made from
ostrich parts could be brought in by tourists.

Thailand's biggest ostrich farm, which is in Ratchaburi
province, currently has 200 ostriches, but they were from
Australia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, some officials from the Thai Public Health Ministry
denied records of the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in
Thailand, but indicating the disease found in South Africa ten
years ago may be spread through blood and lymph contact and ticks
found in feathers.
</P>
<P>
There is no preventive cure for the disease that causes fever,
nausea, pain, bleeding and death, they added.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Laos signed a
memorandum on bilateral trade promotion during Thai Commerce
Minister Narongchai Akrasanee's two-day visit to Laos early this
week, according to a report from Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will speed up goods, mostly made in Thailand,
traveling by road to land-locked Laos.
</P>
<P>
Currently goods in transit incur high transport costs as they
must be transferred to other trucks and routes are limited.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Thailand will help Laos develop its
economy in preparation for joining the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) by holding courses on export promotion,
trade management, administration and other topics.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will also consider giving Laos more flexibility to
obtain tariff benefits on farm product exports to Thailand, and to
receive credit from the Export-Import Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries were worth about 10 billion
baht (400 million U.S. dollars) in 1995, with Thai exports worth 8
billion baht (320 million dollars) and imports worth 2 billion
baht (80 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Hungary Intensifies Efforts for NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has set up a
coordination committee to prepare for entry into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of officials from the ministries of
Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Internal Affairs, Finance,
Transport and the intelligence sector, is headed by Samogyi
Fernec, state secretary of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The inter-ministerial body will handle all issues concerning
Hungary's membership of NATO, including public statements on
progress. Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs told Hungarian television
in December that he believed Hungary would be invited to join NATO
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hungary is one of the three front runners in the race by 11
former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO. The collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991 led many eastern European countries to seek
membership of the western military alliance. But Russia has
opposed NATO's eastward expansion, saying the move would threaten
its own security.
</P>
<P>
NATO is to hold a summit in July which will include discussions
on which eastern European countries to start negotiations with
over membership.

<HEADLINE> Perry Supports U.S. Policy of Engagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry said today that the road of "engagement
and action" the United States has taken is the right one that "has
made all the difference around the world."
</P>
<P>
Perry, to be replaced by Republican Senator William Cohen, made
the remarks at a ceremony in Fort Myer, Virginia, when Clinton
awarded Perry the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- the highest
civilian honor in the country.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that four years ago the United States encountered a
crossroads: one road led to isolation and apathy, and the other,
to engagement and action.
</P>
<P>
"This century has taught us that the road to isolation and
apathy leads to instability and war," said the 69-year-old Perry,
who became the head of Pentagon in 1994 after serving nearly a
year as deputy secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts say Perry credited Clinton's policy of
"engagement" with what was called his greatest achievements:
strengthening security ties with Japan; forging new ties with
Russia, China and Latin America; and dismantling 4,000 nuclear
weapons previously targeted on American cities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised Perry for his contributions to the U.S.
security, saying, "When the history of our time is written, Bill
Perry may well be recorded as the most productive, effective
secretary of defense the United States ever had."

COLOMBO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Parliamentary
Select Committee on Constitutional Reform has approved the draft
Chapter on Fundamental Rights with amendments which expand its
scope and application, local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the expansion is mainly in the area where

remedies from the Supreme Court for actions by the executive or
administration.
</P>
<P>
In addition provision will be made for citizens to obtain
relief from the Supreme Court against infringements by lower
courts which exercise original jurisdiction, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The draft has sought to place limitations in the interest of
national security, public order and the protection of public
health or morality.
</P>
<P>
The article on freedom of speech, assembly, association,
occupation, movement and travel should be subject to the
limitations on it in the present (1978) Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The chapter on fundamental Rights will be included in the
publication of the draft constitution which will be placed before
the people within the next two weeks.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Stronger South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries should
effectively protect their common interest, and see to it that new
international rules reflect the interests of developing countries
in a balanced manner, a senior Chinese trade official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South-South Conference on Trade, Investment and
Finance, Long Yongtu, Chinese Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, elaborated China's position on the
future of South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Long said, as trade was the engine for economic growth,
South-South cooperation in this field should be expanded on a
continuous basis.
</P>
<P>
Though the position of developing countries in the multilateral
trading system had been strengthened with conclusion of the
Uruguay Round Agreements and expansion of the World Trade
Organization, developed countries had constantly pressed for
negotiations in new areas of their concern and used their economic
power to juggle with the "rules of game," he said.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries had tried every means to weaken the
comparative advantages of the developing countries, which were
often at a loss to know what to do and had always been in a
defensive position in the trade negotiations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is, thereof, more important than ever before to consolidate
solidarity and cooperation among the developing countries in order
to coordinate their positions on major issues and to participate
in the decision-making process of the multilateral trading system
with a more united and stronger voice," he said.
</P>
<P>
On investment and industrialization cooperation, Long urged
governments to encourage the flow of capital and technologies
among developing countries and promote economic complementarity
among them.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting human resources development, economic and technical
cooperation, optimizing product mix, improving sustainable
industrialization and product quality should also become important
parts of South-South cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding finance, Long noted that to an overwhelming majority
of developing countries including China, financial service was
still a new and relatively weak industry.
</P>
<P>
It had become an urgent demand for these countries to establish
legal systems and infrastructure for financial services covering
banking, insurance and security businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We should exchange experience, train managerial personnel,
improve management standards and gradually improve our
competitiveness vis-a-vis developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries should jointly reject the excessive
demand of the developed countries for rapid opening of their
financial markets, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Long said that the friendship and cooperation between China and
other developing countries would stand the test of time and tide.
There existed a great potential for economic cooperation between
China and other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China's trade with other developing countries reached
60 billion U.S. dollars. Though China still had 65 million people
living under the poverty line, it had carried out 1,456 assistant
projects, with 500,000 Chinese technical personnel working in 122
developing countries up to the end of 1995, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Issues New Regulation To Improve Control of Publications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council issued a
new regulation today to improve control of the country's
publishing business to see to it that the sector better serves the
nation's socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
The regulation states that every Chinese citizen enjoys the
freedom to publishing, but that activities should be governed by
law.
</P>
<P>
People can freely express their views on state affairs and
publish academic and literary works, but cannot publish any
material that goes against the Constitution or harms the country.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also places restrictions on publications that
target children, and prohibits deleterious or criminal material.
</P>
<P>
It states that the publishing industry's first goal is good
social effect and not just to make money, and should combine
social effects with economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who founds a publishing house and its responsible
institution must get approval from the State Council's
publications administration before the publishing house is set up.
</P>
<P>
The person in charge should also get approval from authorities
to print any material, it says.
</P>
<P>
Piracy is against the law and strictly forbidden by the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Publishers who violate the regulation will be fined, have their
licenses revoked, or charged with crimes and be taken to court.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's publications administration and other
departments will oversee the publishing industry, according to the
regulation, which will take effect February 1.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Hebron Deal Another Step Toward Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
hailed today an Israeli-Palestinian agreement on the Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron, calling it "another
step closer to a lasting, secure Middle East peace."
</P>
<P>
"This achievement brings to a successful conclusion the talks
that were launched in Washington last September and it brings us
another step closer to a lasting, secure Middle East peace,"
Clinton said in a statement delivered shortly after the Israelis
and Palestinians reached the long-delayed accord on Hebron:
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators signed the Hebron deal just
two hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat began a midnight summit on at
Erez crossing between Israel and Gaza Strip, thus ending months of
difficult talks over the Israeli redeployment.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton warned it is not a time to relax, but a time
"to reinforce our commitment to peace."
</P>
<P>
"Bringing its words to life will require active and continuous
cooperation between israeli and Palestinian officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything we can to build a just and durable
peace, a peace that will mean a better life for Israelis, for
Palestinians, for all the people of the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters at the White House that Israel
will promptly redeploy its troops. And there will also be an
agreed road map for further redeployment by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the Palestinians reaffirmed their
commitments, including their commitment to fight terrorism.

<P>
SANTIAGO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The total export volume of
Latin America in 1996 was 240 billion U.S. dollars, representing
an 11 percent growth over 1995, according to figures from the
Santiago Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The chamber pointed out that intra-regional trade increased
seven percent because of the invigorating effect of trade in the
Southern cone (especially between Argentina, Brazil and Chile) and
greater integration between Mexico and other countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, trade between Andean Group countries,
Columbia, Peru, Equador, Venezuela, and Bolivia, has shown
practically zero growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the chamber, Mexico is the biggest exporter in the
region with 40 percent of total shipments.
</P>
<P>
The second largest exporter is Brazil with 22 percent,
followed by Argentina and Venezuela, both with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur countries (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay)
depend on regional demand for 32 percent of their exports.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Control Noisy Car Alarms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to control the
noise caused by anti-theft car alarms, according to "China
Environmental News".
</P>
<P>
A regulation due to take effect in the coming days stipulates
that the alarms used by car owners must meet government-set noise
standards.
</P>
<P>
The capital city has nearly 300,000 motor vehicles with
anti-theft alarm devices installed, according to latest government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The sensitivity of the alarms has been upgraded by
manufacturers over the years to give car owners a sense of
security. The devices can emit loud noises even under normal
conditions, or with just a gentle touch.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection
receives over ten complaints every month about the noise made in
residential areas at night.
</P>
<P>
The alarm sound made by the devices can reach 100 decibels, far
higher than government-set night-time noise standards which are
below 50 decibels.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will help curb the night noise problem in the
capital city of China.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Turn to Self-Serving Restaurants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- New-style restaurants in China
are charging customers - for not eating food.
</P>
<P>
Chinese diners are flocking to help-yourself restaurants where
a set fee is charged for as much as they can eat.
</P>
<P>
But to discourage customers from piling more onto their plates
than their stomachs can handle, some of the restaurants 'fine'
customers for over-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
The trend has even seen waitresses being trained to help
customers save money.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, the south China boom city, people are proud of
eating less expensive food and leaving no food at all at the
table, according to the Chinese intellectuals' newspaper Guangming
Daily Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Waitresses in restaurants in the city used to lure customers
with expensive sea food so that they could make more money, the
newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
"Now, it is different," it says, adding that waitresses are
being trained to help customers choose cheaper food and even point
them to self-service tables.
</P>
<P>
Any food left on the table is often taken home by customers,
with helpful waitresses providing paper bags or boxes for the
leftovers,it reports.
</P>
<P>
"Don't waste," waitresses tell customers if they leave food on
the table or order more than enough, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
Some restaurants post rules and regulations governing the
meals. Customers getting too much food without eating have to pay
an extra fee of 30 percent, it says.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Smokers Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- More and more Filipinos are
smoking despite warnings by health authorities about its dangers,
the local newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer reported today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica was quoted as
saying that a recent study showed an increase in smoking among the
youth and adults.
</P>
<P>
Partial results of the study showed that 72 percent of 1,611
adults surveyed are smoking, compared to 49 percent in 1987. Among
the 2,420 youths (17 years and below) surveyed, 56 percent are
smoking, compared to 22 percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the anti-smoking campaign,
Reodica said the figures were alarming because the more smokers
there are, the more people would be at risk in contracting
smoking-related diseases, including cancer and cardio-vascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
He said lung cancer, which health experts attribute mostly to
cigarette smoke, continues to be the leading cancer in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The paper said 9 of 10 men who die of lung cancer are smokers.
Among women, lung cancer ranks the third cancer killer in the
country.
</P>
<P>
It has also been proven that 25 to 35 percent of cardiovascular
disease cases in the country are smoking-related.
</P>
<P>
Reodica called on legislators to act on pending bills that seek
to reduce the incidence of smoking in the country.
</P>
<P>
These measures include those that regulate the sale of
cigarettes, prohibiting the advertisement of cigarettes in media,
banning smoking in certain public places, including sports arenas.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Conclude Hebron Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- After months of intensive
negotiations, Israel and the Palestinians finally concluded an
agreement in the early hours of this morning on the Israeli
army's redeployment in Hebron and Israeli further pullback in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shai Bazak, media adviser for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, told reporters at the Erez checkpoint between Israel
and the Gaza Strip that the accord was initialed at around 2:15
a.m. local time (0015GMT).
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a 40-minute summit between
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat, with the participation of US and European
mediators.
</P>
<P>
Bazak said that during the meeting phone calls were made to
US President Bill Clinton, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
King Hussein of Jordan who made an important role in bringing
the latest breakthrough in the Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Later at 2:50 a.m. local time (0050GMT) this morning, US
special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross, Netanyahu and
Arafat standing besides him, made the official announcement of
concluding the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has been shuttling between Israel and the
Palestinians for months to push the Hebron deal forward, said
that the deal "is more detailed than the guidelines provided in
the Interim Agreement," known as Oslo 2, to expand Palestinian
autonomy in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross stressed that the agreement which also deals with
non-Hebron issues, has laid "a road map" for further
negotiations between the two sides, and for the whole Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, neither Bazak nor Ross mentioned any details of the
Hebron agreement, a first agreement signed between the Israeli
right-wing government and the Palestinians since Netanyahu took
office last July.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear at this moment whether there will be a special
signing ceremony for the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army radio estimated that after the signing of the
accord, the implementation of the redeployment could be started
at as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interim Agreement, the Israeli army was
originally supposed to complete its redeployment in the Hebron
area by March 28, 1996, pulling back from approximately 80
percent of the town.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel last February and March which left over 60 people dead
and more than 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
After the Palestinian National Council voted to erase the
anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian Covenant on April 24,
redeployment again seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
However, then joined by other influential rabbis (Jewish
religious leaders), Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, mentor of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, asked Peres to delay again.
</P>
<P>
With the May 29 general elections weeks away and the
religious leaders sitting on the fence, Peres held back, and the
government announced that the army's withdrawal from Hebron
would be carried out after elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu
in the elections, said afterward that he would leave the
decision of the redeployment to the new prime minister and his
government.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu had said that he
would like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements
with the Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he
would stand by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had held months of
negotiations on the Hebron redeployment, and for many times the
accord was likely to be closed, but only broke up at the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
The latest breakthrough in the Hebron talks followed a
dramatic summit meeting late Sunday night between Netanyahu and
King Hussein of Jordan in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein reportedly secured a key Palestinian concession
that appears to have brought the sides much closer to a Hebron
agreement during his meeting with Arafat earlier Sunday in the
Gaza Strip before he flew with it from Gaza to Tel Aviv for the
late night with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official said that Arafat agreed to
Hussein's proposal that Israel could prolong its three-stage
withdrawal from West Bank rural areas, narrowing the gap on the
key sticking point in the talks.
</P>
<P>
During previous talks, Arafat has wanted all pullbacks to
conclude by September as called for in the Oslo 2 accords, while
Netanyahu's proposal was for a third pullback by the end of the
interim period, ending in the spring of 1999, so it would
overlap with the deadline for resolving final status issues.
</P>
<P>
Hussein initiated a compromise proposal on a critical future
Israeli army pullback from the West Bank in the middle of 1998,
which would mark the midway point between Israeli and
Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil, or
the Ibrahimi Mosque).
</P>
<P>
Unique among West Bank cities, Jews live side-by-side with
Palestinians in Hebron, approximately 400-500 settlers next to
200,000 Arabs, which explains why until now Hebron remains the
only major West Bank town still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
In 1929, 67 Jews were killed and 60 others wounded during
riots burst out in Hebron, and after which most of the rest of
the Jewish community left the city for good.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlers now living in the center of Hebron moved
back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood after the 1967 War,
during which Israel took over the town from the Jordanian
authority.
</P>
<P>
If the Jews' nightmare in Hebron dates back to 1929, the
Palestinians' deepest wound came on February 25, 1994, when
Baruch Goldstain, a doctor from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat
Arba on the outskirts of Hebron, entered the Tomb of the
Patriarchs and gunned down 29 Moslems at prayer, wounding 125
others.

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Shuts Down Illegal Game Arcades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chengdu, capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province, has closed some 420 illegal game arcades
in a crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Another 1,100 arcades are under inspection to root out
obscene or gambling gaming machines.
</P>
<P>
The arcade business has aroused worries among communities in
the city. The booming sector has earned a bad reputation because
some owners allow access to teenagers and use games with obscene
pictures.
</P>
<P>
Illegal arcade owners have even input pirated discs into their
machines, harming the interests of the owners of the intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
It can also harm to the health of teenagers, and affect their
school work. Some students have even dropped out of school and spent
whole nights in the arcades.
</P>
<P>
The local cultural administration authority last month suspended
all arcade licenses.
</P>
<P>
Some 420 illegal arcades were closed, and the others are
awaiting further information to decide whether they can continue
operating.

<HEADLINE> Underground Water Found in Arid Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Geologists have discovered 63
water-bearing structures with an estimated reserve of six billion
cubic meters of water in Gansu Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
According to the geologists, five billion cubic meters of the
water resources can be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is located in the western part of the Loess Plateau,
which is arid and semi-arid, and water shortage has hintered its
social and economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Gansu started to search for water resources in 1956.
</P>
<P>
While prospecting underground water resources, the geologists
conducted research in rational use of underground water.
</P>
<P>
They have so far delivered 500 research findings on water
prospecting and a dozen color charts of Gansu's hydro-geology and
environment to the state.

<HEADLINE> Internet's Growth Slow In Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Internet network service
has not become a fashion among most Chinese industrial and
commercial companies, according to an official with the Beijing
Telegram Bureau (BTB).
</P>
<P>
There have been only about 10,000 users in the country since
the bureau opened the connection service of the Internet to the
public in 1994, said Shao Ming, a director who is in charge of the
BTB's ChinaNet -- the backbone of the country's Internet network.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese firms have not become conscious of the benefits of
the Internet service, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
The domain names of more than 100 well-known Chinese companies
have been poached by overseas firms, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English language newspaper quoted Gong
Haifeng, general manager of Beijing Eastnet Communication Co
(BECC) under the BTB, as saying "Such rush registrations by
overseas businesses also include names of big hotels and big
cities including Beijing and Shanghai."
</P>
<P>
In general, it costs a company 5,000 yuan (602 US dollars) to
register its name with the Internet through the BECC, Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Gong urged Chinese firms to protect their intangible assets and
legitimate interests as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Improper Internet registration of domain associated with
Chinese companies by overseas businesses is a huge potential
threat to the country's international exchange and commodity
exports as well as Chinese firms' image," Gong said.
</P>
<P>
The indifference is only a transient phenomenon, he said,
adding that more companies will gradually enter the Internet with
the popularization of network knowledge and improvement of the
network service.

<HEADLINE> China Has Built New Amphibious Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A plane that is thought to be a
boat has been developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts describe the new type of amphibious plane as an
important transportation tool for the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The new model, designed and produced by scientists at the China
Academy of Scientific and Technological Development, has already
been geared for mass production, and is expected to go onto market
by the end of 1997, according to Tueday's Guangming Daily, a
newspaper for intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The plane can fly in the sky, and sail on water, the newspaper
said. The sailing speed is ten times that of normal ships because
it skirts one to five meters above the surface of water, and can
land safely on the water surface in case of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
The pontoon plane costs much less than normal planes to build,
but has a load capacity 1.6 tons, the newspaper said. Its flight
speed can reach 200 km per hour, with a height of one to three
meters and a maximum range of 400 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic briefs from Latin America over the past few days:
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina will show a trade deficit of 1.5
billion U.S dollars this year, with its exports amounting to 27
billion U.S. dollars and imports 28.5 billion dollars, Industry
Minister Alieto Guadagni said.
</P>
<P>
Guadagni expected imports of capital goods to increase by 20
percent as there has been a gradual improvement in economic
activity at the end of economic recession.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica reported an inflation of 13.89 percent
in 1996, the lowest reported in the last six years except for 1993
when it dropped to 9.04 percent, according to Economy Ministry
statistics.
</P>
<P>
But it was still 4.0 percent higher than the 10 percent target
which the government had negotiated with the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Inflation stood at 27.25 percent in 1990, 25.35 in 1991, 16.97
in 1992, 19.86 in 1994 and 22.5 last year.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Exports of bottled Chilean wine in 1996 increased
by 45 percent in volume and 63 percent in value over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose to 180 million liters worth a total of 285 million
U.S. dollars, according to the Association of Exporters and Wine
Bottlers in Chile.
</P>
<P>
The most important markets for wine exports were the United
States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Argentina was the largest supplier of
vehicles for the Brazilian market in 1996 when it placed 103,000
units in the country, representing an increase of 145.2 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Argentine automobiles accounted for 46 percent of
Brazil's total car imports, said the National Association of
Automobile Assembly Plants (ANFAV).
</P>
<P>
Up to November 1996, Brazilian automobile imports were valued
at 1.84 billion dollars, a drop of 52.3 percent compared with the
total in 1995.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Fiat, an Italian car company, led sales of new
cars in Uruguay in 1996 by selling 5,219 units, according to
statistics compiled by three automobile organizations.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Volkswagen finished second with 3,926 units followed
by U.S. Chevrolet with 2,357 units.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 new car sales reached 27,530 units in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaraguan coffee growers are reporting losses of 30
percent of their harvests, 40 million U.S. dollars in value, said
a preliminary study from the Nicaraguan Union of Coffee Growers
(UNICAFE).
</P>
<P>
The lower yields have been caused by the lack of financing, the
proliferation of pests, the inaccessibility of roads and weather
problems during the growing season, said the study.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's silver production will increase by 25
percent between 1995-1999, rising from 74.4 million to 93.4
million ounces, said a study from Mexico's Silver Institute.
</P>
<P>
With the projections, Mexico will maintain its lead in the
world silver output, exceeding the United States, Peru and Canada.
</P>
<P>
HAVANA -- Cuba plans to plant 60,300 hectares of tobacco this
year, showing an increase of 40 percent over 1996, according to
Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan.
</P>
<P>
About 49,580 hectares have been planted so far.
</P>
<P>
This year 1 million quintals (46 tons) of tobacco leaves are
expected to be harvested and 100 million units of rolled tobacco
will be produced for export, an surge of 40 percent, respectively,
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Adjusting the structure of the
economy, which is thought to be of strategic importance by Chinese
economists, has become a hot topic in China since the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), has repeatedly urged government
departments to integrate demand and structural readjustment, and
central and local governments have drawn up preliminary plans in
response.
</P>
<P>
Structural reforms are supposed to promote economic efficiency
and economic growth and help China solve such problems as repeated
construction of similar projects, similar economic structures in
various provinces, and low efficiency, one economist explained.
</P>
<P>
A national study has shown that 22 provinces, autonomous
regions, and cities listed automobiles as their pillar industry
for the 1996-2010 period, that 24 regions decided to give priority
to developing the electronic industry, 16 to machinery and
chemical industries, and 14 to metallurgical industry, suggesting
that the period of repeated contruction of similar projects will
start all over again.
</P>
<P>
So structural readjustment will begin with a rigid scrutiny of
new projects, explained an official with the State Planning
Commission (SPC). The country will approve no new projects that
already have excessive production capacity or are low-grade, and
will halt projects that are technologically backward, or small in
production scale and likely to be loss-makers, the SPC official
noted, adding that his commission will work out new policies on
industrial production.

<HEADLINE> Russia Moves Equipment of Disputed Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia has moved military
equipment belonging to the disputed Black Sea Fleet from the
Russian port city of Novorossiysk inland to Krasnodarskij, the
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move was allegedly made by Russian officers of the fleet to
avoid the equipment being split between Ukraine and Russia as part
of the division of the naval fleet of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The equipment reportedly belonged to the reconnaissance troops
of the fleet based in Novorossiysk.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that Russia's move will worsen the already
strained Ukrainian-Russian ties caused by a dispute over how to
divide the fleet, which was set up by Catherine the Great three
centuries ago and served as a Soviet counterbalance against the
U.S. 6th Fleet during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Ukraine have made claims to the fleet after the
Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991. Talks have been going on for
five years on how to divide the fleet and its assets.
</P>
<P>
But relations have soured recently over claims by Russian
parliamentarians that the headquarters of the fleet, the Ukrainian
city of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula, is Russian
territory.

Zhang Hanya, deputy head of the SPC's investment research
institute, revealed that the central government will continue its
tight control on investment in fixed assets this year, holding the
total amount to between 2.65 trillion and 2.9 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China will increase investment structure reforms because they
are an important part of structural readjustment, and will develop
an investment risk mechanism, a project capital system and a legal
person responsibility system, and an investment law as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Experts and local officials have proposed that certain
departments should work out plans for structural readjustment,
growth rate, and economic targets for different regions, making
full use of taxes as regulatory means and promoting structural
readjustment by economic means.
</P>
<P>
Some experts see co-investment as a viable option. The practice
of raising funds for large projects by several provinces has been
and will continue to be supported by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Larger scale integration and mergers are unavoidable in the
course of economic structural readjustment, and will be closely
linked to the regrouping of fixed assets of enterprises and
changes in property rights to rejuvenate large state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The aim of readjusting economic structures is to devise a new
economic pattern geared to the 21st century. It will put stress on
improving the country's economic strength as a whole, according to
one economist.

<HEADLINE> Money Gone With The Wind - But Not For Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- It was an ill wind that blew
on the last day of 1996 when Zhao Ying went to collect 10,000 yuan
from a bank in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
A strong gust sent the whole lot blowing through the air like
confetti.
</P>
<P>
Zhou and her companion Xiao Shi almost cried with despair as
they saw the notes disappearing with the wind, chased by crowds of
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
But their tears turned to smiles as members of the public
returned the 100-yuan notes they had retrieved.
</P>
<P>
"I felt happy and pleasantly surprised when I saw passers-by
chasing the money and returning it to me," Zhao Ying told the
Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily".
</P>
<P>
Zhao, a finance manager at the Shenyang Xinshiji (New Age)
Entertainment Center was almost blown over by the strong wind. She
bumped into her colleague, Xiao Shi, as they walked in the
downtown city.
</P>
<P>
They were stunned to see a pile of 100-yuan notes, which had
been withdrawn from a nearby bank, falling out of Zhao's
purse. The notes were immediately blown away by the gust.
</P>
<P>
"We were stunned and almost cried in despair while many
pedestrians ran to catch the notes," recalled Zhao and Xiao Shi.
</P>
<P>
To their great surprise, people returned the money one by
one. A middle-aged man who picked 3,000 yuan refused to tell Zhao
his name when she expressed her gratitude.
</P>
<P>
"An old man standing by me told me that he had watched everyone
for a while. Nobody took the cash away," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The old man's words were proved correct -- except for one note
flew too far away for anyone to find, the rest of the notes,
adding to to 9,900 yuan, were returned in just 20 minutes, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
A 100-yuan note is the largest denomination among China's
banknotes. The average monthly pay of a Chinese worker is around
400 yuan (48 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Transport 7.85 Million Passengers in Festival Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Rail, highway, air and water
transport companies in Shanghai, China's largest city, are
expected to handle about 7.85 million passengers during the Spring
Festival holiday season between January 18 to March 8.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4.15 million train passengers are expected to
leave or arrive in Shanghai, a rise of 0.7 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
People using more expensive air transport will be around
860,000, an increase of 11.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
While long-distance bus passengers are expected to reach about
970,000, a rise of three percent.
</P>
<P>
Passengers travelling by boats and ships will number 640,000, a
drop of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Municipal transportation authorities said that holiday
tourists, including those from Hong Kong and Macao, are expected
to contribute most of the growth in this year's rise in holiday
passenger flow.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of migrant worker passengers is expected
to drop, since such forces working in Shanghai decreased by
100,000 this year to 1.87 million.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate the holiday season passenger flow, the
municipality will add 16.5 extra trains, 40 passenger ships, 47
buses, and more aircraft.

MANIlA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will buy 18
foreign jet fighters worth of 56 billion pesos (2.1 billion U.S.
dollars) in the next five years as part of its drive to modernize
its Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine military had initially planned to acquire 36
fighter planes from abroad, but the number was cut by the
Congress, today's Manila Bulletin quoted Chief of Staff of the
Armed Forces General Arnulfo Acedera as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 165 billion pesos (6.3 billion dollars) allotted for the
AFP modernization program in the next five years, the aircraft
acquisition will amount to 56 billion pesos (2.13 billion
dollars), Acedera said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine military has narrowed down to three its list of
jet fighters it is considering to purchase from abroad -- the
United States F-18, the Russian Mig-29, and the Eurofighter which
is believed to be the most modern in their class, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Air Force now has four remaining F-5 fighters,
which have been the sole jet fighters for the country since the
1960s.

<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court has
decided to conduct a public hearing on January 23 on the petition
challenging the constitutionality of a people's initiative to
amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution issued Tuesday, the high tribunal also affirmed
the temporary restraining order given last December by Chief
Justice Andres Narvasa, according to today's Manila Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The temporary order banned the gathering of signatures launched
by the People's Initiative for Reforms, Modernization, and Action
(PIRMA) for a national plebiscite on constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA and two other private groups have been seeking to
amend the Constitution to extend the term limits for all elected
officials, including that of President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Under the order, the PIRMA cannot undertake any signature
gathering activity until the high court resolves the case in its
favor.
</P>
<P>
The petition against the so-called people's initiative, which
led the Supreme Court to issue the order, was filed by senators
Miriam Defensor Santiago, Alexander Padilla, and Maria Isabel
Ongpin.

<HEADLINE> China's Banks to Help State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Two major State-owned banks
vowed recently to continue to support State-owned enterprises in
1997, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper cited Liu Tinghua, president of the
 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), as saying that
strong performers in the State sector and 500 key enterprises
designated by the central government will remain at the top of the
client list of the ICBC.
</P>
<P>
China Construction Bank (CCB) President Wang Qishan said his
bank will enhance cooperation with large enterprises, and pay
special attention to firms and trades rejuvenated during the
country's economic adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Liu said, ICBC will follow the central bank's policy in loan
approval to avoid excessive repetition of similar projects. The
bank plans to limit its 1997 credit amount within 25 billion US
dollars in 1997 compared to 26.5 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
CCB registered a record increase in loans last year, growing
16.8 percent to 15.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liu disclosed that ICBC decided to play an active part in State
enterprises' bankruptcy and acquisition, and its branches should
take part in the drafting of bankruptcy and acquisition processes
to ensure proper practices of Bankruptcy and acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The two banks have decided to streamline their business
networks. Affiliates with small business volume and poor business
records will be closed.
</P>
<P>
CCB is determined to withdraw from rural counties to
concentrate its business in big and medium-sized cities in
prosperous regions.
</P>
<P>
To reduce possible business risks, the two banks will adopt a
more centralized system in credit business in the new year under
which the head offices and first-grade branches will have more
power in credit approval of sub-branches. They will make great
efforts to absorb deposits.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited Liu as saying that he anticipated that deposits
of ICBC, which topped 216 billion US dollars by the end of 1996,
would increase by 35 billion US dollars in 1997, compared with 41
billion US dollars in last year.

<HEADLINE> Equatorial Guinean President Meets Chinese Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALABO, Equatorial Guinea, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here Tuesday night
that China is willing to develop friendly cooperative relations
with Equatorial Guinea.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro
Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Qian said the two countries have respected
and supported each other politically, and cooperated effectively
on economic and trade issues since diplomatic relations were
established in 1970.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people cherish their traditional friendship with
Equatorial Guinea, and are willing to further develop bilateral
friendly cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, he said.
</P>
<P>
China enjoys traditional friendly cooperative relations with
Africa, Qian said and maintains the principle that world nations,
big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, have an equal right to
participate in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
They have the right to handle their own affairs and no external
forces should interfere in them, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Obiang said that Equatorial Guinea and China have supported and
helped each other, and have enjoyed good bilateral relations since
the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches no political and economic conditions to
its assistance to Equatorial Guinea, and cooperation between
the two countries is sincere.
</P>
<P>
Obiang expressed gratitude to the Chinese government and people
for their assistance.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Obiang agreed that while Africa still faces many
difficulties, the situation on the continent is becoming less
tense. They said that many countries have resisted external
pressure and are striving to decide their own political systems
and modes of development.
</P>
<P>
The international community and developed countries have the
responsibility to help Africa develop its economy and help set
up a favorable international political and economic environment
for African development.
</P>
<P>
Obiang visited China in August 1984, April 1990, and August
1996.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Conclude Hebron Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- After months of intensive
negotiations, Israel and the Palestinians finally concluded an
agreement in the early hours of this morning on the Israeli
army's redeployment in Hebron and Israeli further pullback in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shai Bazak, media adviser for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, told reporters at the Erez checkpoint between Israel
and the Gaza Strip that the accord was initialed at around
2:15 a.m. local time (0015GMT).
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a 40-minute summit between
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat, with the participation of US and European
mediators.
</P>
<P>
Bazak said that during the meeting phone calls were made
to US President Bill Clinton, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and King Hussein of Jordan who made an important role in
bringing the latest breakthrough in the Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Later at 2:50 a.m. local time (0050GMT) this morning, US
special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross, Netanyahu and
Arafat standing besides him, made the official announcement of
concluding the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has been shuttling between Israel and the
Palestinians for months to push the Hebron deal forward, said
that the deal "is more detailed than the guidelines provided
in the Interim Agreement," known as Oslo II, to expand
Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross stressed that the agreement which also deals with
non-Hebron issues, has laid "a road map" for further
negotiations between the two sides, and for the whole Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, neither Bazak nor Ross mentioned any details of
the Hebron agreement, a first agreement signed between the
Israeli right-wing government and the Palestinians since Netanyahu
took office last July.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear at this moment whether there will be a
special signing ceremony for the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army radio estimated that after the signing of the
accord, the implementation of the redeployment could be started
at as early as Friday.

<HEADLINE> Education Input Should Be Guaranteed: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior education official has
asked that education spending take an increasing share of the
nation's revenue budget.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixuan, minister of the State Education Commission,
stressed in Beijing the need to enforce legal means to check
consecutive drops of its proportion in China's general domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The budget and expenditure on education have been increasing
annually. However, China still faces a shortage of financial input
into education, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 education expenditure is estimated at 214.4 billion
yuan (about 26 billion US dollars), up from 187.8 billion yuan
(about 22.6 billion US dollars) in 1995, and nearly three times
the 1991 level of 73.2 billion yuan (8.8 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The nation's total education investment during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991 to 1995) period reached 602 billion yuan
(about 72.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, education investment last year was estimated to
account for 2.44 percent of the GDP, two percentage points down
from that of 1995. The major financial indicator in 1991 was 2.85
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the decreasing share in the GDP, the proportion
of money going into education outside the total financial
expenditure continually decreased as well, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the commission indicate that in 1996 China had
136 million primary school pupils, 50.47 million junior middle
school students and 3.02 million college students, up 3.2 percent,
6.8 percent and 4.0 percent respectively compared with the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the SEC, together with relevant financial
departments, should try every possible means to guarantee that the
annual education budget grows faster than the nation's regular
yearly revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also plans to press for education to be listed
separately with its own independent budget, instead of as part of
a package that also includes science, culture and health care.

<P>
SAN JOSE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A new agenda of south-south
relations will emerge from the meeting that the Group of 77 (G-77)
and China have been holding here since Monday, Costa Rican Foreign
Minister Fernando Naranjo said today.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 108 of the 132 G-77 member states are trying to
update the agenda and explore new possibilities for cooperation
among countries in the southern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
As the chairman of the meeting, the foreign minister said that
private sector representatives were attending a G-77 meeting for
the first time. He regretted that businessmen still gave priority
to markets in the northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
G-77 delegates are analyzing the "Declaration of San Jose" and
an action blueprint. "This conference emphasizes south-south
relations", the Costa Rican minister added.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from Tanzania, the country that will take
over the rotating presidency of the bloc, stressed the staggering
foreign debt affecting many African nations.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo said a solution to the debt problem was still very
distant since the most indebted countries "cannot fulfill those
commitments."
</P>
<P>
This two-day conference was convened by Costa Rica, ending its
one-year presidency of the G-77.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Wool Prices Fall Causes Concern in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sheep farmers and wool
exporters in New Zealand have been shocked by the falling wool
prices, which sank to a four-year low at the country's first wool
sale this year.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue of Wool Market Review, the Wool Board
blames the high NZ dollar for the price fall, and said the lack of
demand from China, which buys about one third of NZ wool, also
contributes to the price slump.
</P>
<P>
Standing at 421 NZ cents (one NZ dollar presently equals 70 US
cents) a kilogram, is the lowest in four years. This price
recorded at the sale on January 9 is 20 percent cheaper than the
same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Wool price began to pick up in 1993 after several years of
depression, helping to reduce the large stock produced during the
years of low prices. The market indicator reached a five year high
of nearly 650 cents in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
As international demand increased, NZ soon cleared all its
stock and for a short period, sheep farmers reaped better returns.
</P>
<P>
However, wool prices began to tumble from early last year while
the NZ dollar started to firm up against the major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The latest price slide has rekindled concern among the farmers
and exporters alike over the future of the wool industry.
</P>
<P>
Charles Hall of the wool exporting company Brooksbank said the
continuing lack of demand means it is becoming the worst downturn
in decades.
</P>
<P>
One market analyst said that if wool prices do not improve
soon, after slumping considerable during the past two seasons, it
could have noticeable effects on the rest of the economy.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural analyst said many factors other than the high
dollar have led to the price slump. Kevin Wilson said other
factors like product demand, quality and the cost of cheaper
alternative fibers are also driving the price down.
</P>
<P>
Federated Farmers spokesman Rupert Curd warned that the low
wool prices have added to the burden of farmers who have already
had to cope with poor meat prices.
</P>
<P>
But increases in Australian wool prices last week have raised
hope for better returns in NZ. The price hike has been taken as a
sign that things could turn around for NZ farmers soon. NZ wool
prices tend to follow Australia's.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Determined to Curb Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government, in a
bid to stop drug trafficking in the country, presented to the
parliament a draft bill on the ratification of the 1988 United
Nations convention on the eradication of the illegal trafficking
of narcotics and psychotropics.
</P>
<P>
The government has realized that the country's existing
narcotics law and the draft bill on psychotropics are
insufficient, Justice Minister Oetojo Oesman said when presenting
the draft bill here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the UN convention is inseparable from UN
efforts to control the distribution and abuse of narcotics and
psychotropics across the world.
</P>
<P>
The UN convention was adopted during a UN conference in Vienna
from November 25 to December 20 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The UN considers the illegal trafficking of drugs to be the
biggest trade in the world after armaments sale.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna convention was a follow-up to the International
Conference on Drug Abuse and Illegal Trafficking in Vienna in
1987.
</P>
<P>
According to Oesman, the international community regards the
illegal distribution of drugs as a serious issue as drugs are
detrimental to the community and the nation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in Indonesia, the illegal trafficking of
narcotics and psychotropics has threatened the national security
and order, affecting its national development programs.

JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians
initialed an agreement at the Erez Crossing, Gaza Strip on the
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron,
according to an Israeli government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after an overnight summit between Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came as a result of four months of tough

The latest breakthrough in the Hebron talks followed a

King Hussein reportedly secured a key Palestinian concession

A senior Palestinian official said that Arafat agreed to
Hussein's proposal that Israel could prolong its three-stage

<HEADLINE> Opposition Sees Belgrade Commission's Decision as Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Serbia's opposition leader Vuk
Draskovic welcomed on Tuesday the decision of the Belgrade
Electoral Commission to acknowledge second round election results,
saying it was a good move "although some facts are still not
clear."
</P>
<P>
Draskovic is the president of the Serbian Renewal Movement,
which forms the opposition Zajedno coalition with two other
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade Electoral Commission on Tuesday recognized the
results of the second round of November 17 elections, which gave
the Zajedno coalition 60 seats in the 110-seat city council, or
Belgrade's municipal assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to the election commission, the governing Socialist
Party of Serbia (SPS) won 23 seats, the opposition Serbian Radical
Party, 15, and the Democratic Party of Serbia, 2 seats.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the SPS appeals the commission's decision, it will be a
sign that things are slowly moving towards a full recognition of
November 17 election results and recommendations of the (Felipe)
Gonzalez mission," Draskovic told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Zajedno coalition has been leading massive protests over
the past eight weeks over the annulment of the November election
results, and demanded the full recognition of their victory in the
elections. The opposition claims it has won local elections in 14
out of 18 biggest cities in Serbia, and their claims were
confirmed by the OSCE fact-finding delegation headed by former
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
If the Serbian government recognized "all the November 17
election results, we would call off our protests," he added.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic also said there were still 10 controversial seats in
the assembly and he believed these disputed seats should be
recognized as won by the Zajedno, "or possibly hold a third round
of voting to decide those 10 seats."

CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

examination of vouchers for students and the unprecedented
commercialization of universities in a wide-ranging review of the
five billion Australian dollars (four billion US dollars) higher
education sector.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Departmental spending in New South Wales has risen by 450

<HEADLINE> Talks on Missing Persons with Croatia Successful, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The talks held here Tuesday by
Yugoslav and Croatian government commissions for humanitarian
issues and missing persons were very successful, Yugoslav
commission secretary Maksim Korac said.
</P>
<P>
Korac told the press that the meeting was organized in line
with the agreement on cooperation in searching for missing persons
signed last April by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic
and his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic and with the agreement on
the normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Croatia, the two powerful countries in the
Balkan region, normalized their diplomatic relations in August
last year under strong pressure from the West, thus making the
region further stabilized.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had exchanged documents on more than 100 dead
persons either identified or unidentified. Two out of the five
persons held in Croatian prisons, under Yugoslavia requests, have
been released and Croatian officials had promised that everything
would be done to release the rest three, the Yugoslav official
said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Croatian commission Ivan Grujic said the
meeting had achieved a significant progress as regards the
exchange of documents on the persons killed, identified or
unidentified.
</P>
<P>
He said Croatia was still searching for 2,500 missing persons
and that it would do everything to provide the Yugoslav commission
with relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will also be done to resolve the issue of missing
persons in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Grujic added.
</P>
<P>
During the four-year civil war in Bosnia that ended in late
1995, more than 10,000 persons were claimed missing. The Muslim
leaders say about 6,000 Muslim men were missing when the Muslim
enclave Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia was overrun by the Serb army
in July 1995 and these missing persons are most probably dead.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Electoral Commission Recognizes Second </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Belgrade Electoral

Commission on Tuesday annulled 45 rulings of the first municipal

court and recognized the preliminary results of the second round

of elections for municipal assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the commission Radomir Lazarevic told a news

conference that, according to the preliminary results, the

opposition Zajedno coalition won 60 seats in the 110-seat city

council, and the coalition of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia

(SPS) and the Yugoslav Left (JUL), 23 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Radical Party won 15 seats, and the Democratic

Party of Serbia, 2 seats, Lazarevic added.
</P>
<P>
The Zajedno claims it has won the November 17 local elections

in 14 out of 18 biggest cities in Serbia. It has been staging

demonstrations to protest the annulment of the local election

results by the court ruling and demanded to full reinstatement of

the election results.
</P>
<P>
Lazarevic said that at Tuesday's session, the commission voted,

with one vote against, "to annul the 45 court rulings and 45

decisions of the Belgrade Electoral Commission taken on the basis

of those rulings."
</P>
<P>
The Serbian election commission has already admitted that the

opposition had won elections in Serbia's second largest city Nis

and several other cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Lazarevic also added that those parties which were dissatisfied

with this decision could lodge appeals with the competent court

within 48 hours of the receipt of the decision.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's decision by the election commission shows that the

Serbian government is making further concessions in the political

crisis to the Zajedno coalition after the latter has been leading

anti-government demonstrations over the past eight weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister

Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President

Yasser Arafat started their third summit meeting in the last 20

days to try to put finishing touches on an agreement on Israeli

army's redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the meeting, held at the Erez checkpoint

between Israel and the Gaza Strip, was made this afternoon by US

special Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross who earlier

threatened to leave the region if agreement is not reached.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the meeting started at 0035 midnight (1035GMT),

Netanyahu said that "chance of concluding the Hebron agreement

tonight exists, but it is not guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the extended negotiations, Netanyahu said the

new Hebron agreement "is better and safer for both sides."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier made remarks at a joint press conference

with visiting Polish Prime Minister Wtodzimierz Cimoszwiez, who

arrived here earlier today for an official visit.
</P>
<P>

dramatic summit meeting late Sunday night between Netanyahu and

that appears to have brought the sides much closer to a Hebron

agreement during his meeting with Arafat earlier Sunday in the

<P>
A senior Palestinian official said that Arafat agreed to

Hussein's proposal that Israel could prolong its three-stage

withdrawal from West Bank rural areas, narrowing the gap on the

key sticking point in the talks.
</P>
<P>
During previous talks, Arafat has wanted all pullbacks to

conclude by September as called for in the Oslo II accords,

while Netanyahu's proposal was for a third pullback by the end

of the interim period, ending in the spring of 1999, so it would

overlap with the deadline for resolving final status issues.
</P>
<P>
Hussein initiated a compromise proposal on a critical future

Israeli army pullback from the West Bank in the middle of 1998,

which would mark the midway point between Israeli and

Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that the Hebron accord was imminent and could be

initialed as early as Monday afternoon, however it actually took

another two days before Netanyahu and Arafat decided to meet for

the final touch.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, besides Ross, Spanish Ambassador to

Israel and European Union special envoy to the Middle East

Migueio Angel Moratinos was also invited to tonight's summit,

which indicates that the Hebron deal probably would be signed

this time.

ATHENS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros

Pangalos today held talks with his visiting Dutch counterpart Hans

Van Mierlo on a number of issues concerning EU and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the talks, Mierlo, whose country is

currently holding the presidency of EU, said the issue of EU

common external borders is included in the agenda of the Inter-

Governmental Conference (IGC) and Dutch supports the safeguarding

of solidarity between member-states.
</P>
<P>
The talks, apart from progress in the IGC, also touched upon a

broad range of issues, particularly the Cyprus problem, the

prospects for a start to negotiations for the island-republic's

entry to the EU and the convening of the EU-Turkey Association

Council.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo said however the EU is not a defense organization which

can provide military assistance, as, for instance, is the case

with NATO.
</P>
<P>
He described as "very important" the Cyprus issue, which "has

been in a stalemate for many years now, and must be overcome in

the interests of Greece, Turkey, Europe, and, of course, Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the Dutch presidency's adherence to the timetable

for a start to negotiations for Cypriot entry to the EU six months

after the end of IGC.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Minister said the discussion also included the issues

of illegal immigration, crime and drugs, on which "our positions

are very close to those of the Dutch presidency."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The NCR Corporation and

Computer Associates International (CA), two major computer system

producers of the U.S., today announced an agreement which

encourages customers to use CA software to manage their NCR

computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, CA's Unicenter TNG will become the

enterprise management solution for NCR platforms, including its

data warehouse and transaction processing environments based on

NCR's WorldMark servers, now servicing the world's largest

retailers and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will make it easier for NCR to sell its

hardware to customers who have already adopted Computer Associates

software as a corporate standard, according to analysts here.
</P>
<P>
CA's Unicenter TNG, now the company's fastest-growing product,

is an enterprise management solution to enable organizations to

view and manage their entire information technology environment --

from the mainframe to the Internet -- end-to-end. With this

system, managers can monitor the status of NCR automatic teller

machines and other point of sales (POS) devices.
</P>
<P>
Computer Associates is the second-largest independent software

company in the world after the Microsoft Corporation.
</P>
<P>
NCR, which was spun off from AT&AMP;T earlier this month, has made

its presence in more than 120 countries and regions throughout the

world, NCR officials said. The cooperation with CA will enable the

company to concentrate its resources on its core businesses.

Currently, NCR relies on software from the Hewlett-Packard Company

and its own to help its customers manage their systems.

LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major stock markets

in Europe made strong gains and ended sharply higher, with London

and Paris closing at new record highs, as new US economic data

eased fears of inflation and interest rates hike.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London soared strongly for the second day

running as fading concerns over the threat of a rise in interest

rates and a buoyant Wall Street sent leading shares to a new

The FTSE 100 index ended up 60.9 points at a record 4,168.2,

surpassing the previous intraday peak of 4,123.2 set on the New

record high, 40.87 points up at 2,402.14, breaching the important

2,400 level.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market's rise was mainly due to benign US

inflation and retail sales data and bullish profit expectations

and low interest rates for this year.

However, German shares in Frankfurt closed slightly lower in

muted trade ahead of key US consumer prices data, with the DAX-30

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Says Crisis on Missile Issue Defused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department official

Carey Cavanaugh said today that the recent crisis over Nicosia's

decision to purchase Russian anti-aircraft missiles had been

defused, since the Cyprus government had assured him that the

S-300 system would not be installed for at least 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Greek Foreign Ministry

General Secretary Alexandros Filon, the director of the U.S. State

Department's southern European bureau said he had been given the

assurance during "constructive" talks in Nicosia Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh said his present round of visits to Cyprus, Greece

and Turkey was within the framework of U.S. efforts to reduce

tension in the region, noting that "positive steps" had been taken

in this direction during his talks in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his talks was to avert the possibility of

conflict, he said, adding that he had ascertained the full support

of Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides during a discussion about the

adoption of confidence-building measures to reduce tension along

the ceasefire line dividing the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has made repeated threat that it would strike the Greek

Cypriot-controlled area if the Cyprus government goes ahead with

deployment of the Russian missile system.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh described as useful his talks in Athens both with

Filon and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
He said the ten-minute meeting with Pangalos focused

exclusively on the latter's visit to Belgrade on Sunday for talks

with Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and opposition party

representatives.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh confirmed that an "overall initiative" would soon be

undertaken for the settlement of the Cyprus problem, adding that

both the U.S. and the international community in its entirety were

determined to contribute with all means to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his trip to Ankara tomorrow, the U.S. envoy

expressed optimism that the stance of the Turkish leadership to

his proposals would be positive.
</P>
<P>
There is a commitment, he said, concerning a package of

confidence-building measures which are aimed at "making Cypriots

feel safer".

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Corroding Poses No Crisis, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The corroded pipes at the Point

Lepreau nuclear power plant in New Brunswick poses no immediate

crisis, the top official of the New Brunswick (NB) Power

Corporation said today.
</P>
<P>
"The perception of an immediate operational crisis at Point

Lepreau and a pending financial crisis for NB Power is not

accurate," James Handinson, NB Power President, told a special

meeting of the NB provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported last week the discovery of a design

flaw at the New Brunswick Candu nuclear plant, where the feeder

pipes of the reactor are thinning because of unexpected corrosion.
</P>
<P>
"Corrosion problems... could be endemic to all of Canada's 22

Candu reactors," said an official with Canada's Atomic Energy

Control Board (CAEC).
</P>
<P>
"If the corrosion cannot be corrected, it could mean an early

death for some, if not all, of Canada's nuclear reactors," the

CAEC official warned.
</P>
<P>
Hankison said today the research is just beginning into the

corrosion problem.
</P>
<P>
"We need a more balanced analytical and thoughtful assessment,"

he was quoted as saying by media reports here.
</P>
<P>
The power plant is now operating safely despite a series of

radioactive heavy water leaks, including one that has yet to be

repaired, he said.
</P>
<P>
The heavy water is being recovered at no safety risk or cost,

and the leak doesn't appear to be associated with the corroding

pipe problem, he added.

<HEADLINE> Famed Aristotle Lyceum Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Culture Minister Evangelos

Venizelos today confirmed newspaper reports revealing that a

large ancient complex unearthed during construction work in Athens

was indeed the famed Lyceum where Aristotle is believed to have

taught.
</P>
<P>
The complex was discovered Monday during construction work for

the Goulandris Museum of Contemporary Art on Rigillis Street,

about 600 meters from the parliament building in central Athens.
</P>
<P>
Venizelos said he had first been informed about the matter in

November last year and has subsequently made statements in

parliament.
</P>
<P>
The find is to be discussed by the Central Archaeological

Council next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have been trying to locate the lost Lyceum of

Athens -- considered one of the three greatest academies of

philosophy of ancient Greece -- for the past 150 years. The other

two renowned such ancient Athens schools were the academy of Plato

and the academy of Kynosargous.
</P>
<P>
It comes just three days after archaeologists claimed to have

found the cave of Salamina used as a reteat by Euripides to write

his classic tragedies.
