<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Panel Contradicts Pentagon on Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Senate committee
said in a report released Tuesday that there was no evidence that
mysteriously ill U.S. soldiers who fought in the Gulf War were
exposed to nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee said that the Pentagon
was inaccurate to conclude that as many as 100,000 soldiers were
exposed to chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said last year that up to 100,000 soldiers were
exposed to low doses of nerve gases released in the demolition of
an Iraqi ammunition depot in March 1991, days after the war had
ended.
</P>
<P>
"There is insufficient evidence at this time to prove or
disprove that there was actual low-level exposure of any troops to
chemical weapon nerve agents or that any of the health effects
some veterans are experiencing were caused by such exposure," said
the Senate panel report.
</P>
<P>
The Senate report argued there was no hard evidence to back the
report's conclusions. It said the Pentagon, working with the CIA,
relied on a flawed computer model to re-create the exposure levels
and assumed a worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
The Senate study backed up the Pentagon's original position
that U.S. troops were not exposed to chemical weapons during the
Gulf War, despite the mysterious illnesses many soldiers suffered.
</P>
<P>
After five years of denials, the Defense Department reported in
the summer of 1996 that Americans were exposed to chemical
fallout. Initially, the department estimated that 20,000 troops
were exposed, but it revised the figure later.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton reached broad
agreement on the START nuclear arms reduction treaties Tuesday,
the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the first round of meeting between
Yeltsin and Clinton, the Kremlin said: "The two presidents
discussed matters linked to START I and II and the future START
III agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Concrete tasks were assigned to experts in particular on
defining the basic parameters of START III," it said.
</P>
<P>
Talks on START II, expected to be a major topic of the two-day
summit, has yet to be ratified by the Russian State Duma, (lower
house of the Russian parliament). Duma fears that the START II
treaty would give the United States a strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
The START II treaty, which the U.S. Senate approved in 1996,
was concluded five years ago. The treaty would reduce the
U.S. arsenal of nuclear warheads to 3,500 and Russia's stock to
3,000.

<HEADLINE> Finland Launches Nationwide Survey on Anti-flood Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Finland is carrying out a
nationwide survey on its flood-combating capacity, the Ministry of
Agriculture announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, aimed at preparing the country for possible serious
floods, started in the wake of the exceptionally huge floods
ravaging central Europe in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The water resource department of the ministry originally drew a
one-year program for the survey. The time-consuming project,
however, has to continue till the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials also announced on Tuesday that the country's
first flood-relief exercise would be held along the Kimi river,
the largest in Finland, in the next year.
</P>
<P>
Finland, a reputed "country of lakes" because ten percent of
its territory is covered by water, was hit by a serious flood in
its eastern lake area in 1899.
</P>
<P>
The Finland people, worried by the frequent occurrence of
floods in some areas in recent years, have developed a strong
sense of combating floods. They demand the government to perfect
its anti-flood system.

<HEADLINE> Japan Metes Out Sanctions to Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan decided Tuesday not to
resume normalization talks with the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) following Pyongyang's firing of a ballistic
missile into the Pacific, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached at a meeting by Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura, Defense
Agency Chief Fukushiro Nukaga and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromo
Nonaka.
</P>
<P>
Japan offered to resume normalization talks with the DPRK
without conditions earlier, but abandoned the offer for the time
being, Kyodo quoted government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese leaders agreed to suspend work on an international
project to build light-water reactors in the DPRK, adding that
they also agreed not to provide food aid to the DPRK for now.
</P>
<P>
The missile firing directly involves Japan's security and it is
an extremely regrettable situation, Nonaka said in a statement
issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The incident is also extremely deplorable in the viewpoint of
peace and stability in Northeast Asia and nonproliferation of
weapons of mass destruction," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government would file protests to the DPRK at all
levels and urge the country to stop development and export of
missiles, it added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK reportedly fired a newly developed, two-stage
ballistic missile Monday that passed over northeastern Japan and
fell into the Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urged to Interfere in Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano and his visiting Algerian counterpart Liamine Zeroural
suggested here Tuesday that the Organization of African Union
(OAU) should interfere in the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the two presidents urged
countries and organizations concerned to double their efforts
in finding out solutions for the crisis in the peace process in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Chissano and Zeroural also expressed their concern over
the military conflicts in Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"We find that the questions in Western Sahara are far from
being solved, so all parties involved should observe the U.N.
resolutions on issues in the region," Chissano said
</P>
<P>
On Mozambique's debt to Algeria, Chissano said that Algeria
would take a "sympathetic" attitude on the issue, considering
that Mozambique has no such ability to pay it back for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique owes about 200 million U.S. Dollars to Algeria
when it imported oil from the northern African country in the
70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
Zeroural arrived in Maputo Sunday and left for Durban, South
Africa Tuesday for the Non-Aligned Movement summit to be held
Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Launches Diplomatic Campaign to Dismiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said Tuesday that it
has started a diplomatic campaign aimed at disqualifying a
proposal by Turkish Cypriots on establishing a bi-communal
confederation on this divided island.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou, who is also
acting Foreign Minister, told reporters here that President
Glafcos Clerides's reply to Denktash's proposal has been sent to
the United Nations Security Council and other U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash proposed the
establishment of a "Cyprus Confederation" with "two sovereign
and equal states" on the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, in a written statement from Durban, South Africa,
where he is attending the Non-Aligned summit, stated that "under
no circumstances can Mr. Denktash's proposal form a basis for
talks as it is unacceptable right from the start."
</P>
<P>
He termed the proposal as being contrary to and contemptuous of
the concerned U.N. resolutions, the high-level agreements that
Denktash himself has signed and international law.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said instructions had also been given to the
heads of Cyprus' diplomatic missions abroad to make its position
known to the governments and international orgnizations they are
accredited to.
</P>
<P>
Two high-level agreements reached between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides in 1977 and 1979, signed by Denktash
himself, envisaged the establishment of a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation in Cyprus. This was also included in numerous
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north, which was recognized only by Turkey.

CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government has allocated 22 million
Jordan dinars (31 million U.S. dollars) this year to help poor
people, the Jordan Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Aid Fund has distributed the money to more than
35,000 people in some 6,000 families for them to buy essential
needs, and pay for children's education.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian Professional Placement Company will
begin operation late this year to help lower the country's soaring
unemployment and increase foreign currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
The company, Jordan's first state-owned service for labor
export, will help Jordanians find jobs in foreign countries,
especially in the Gulf Arab states, the Jordan Times daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the plan is a feasible way to help the
government tackle the rising joblessness, which is estimated at 15
percent by officials and 26 percent by independent sources.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The recent depreciation of the Israeli currency,
the shekel, will result in an annual increase of 0.8 percent in
inflation, now estimated to reached 4.8 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment by economists at the Israeli
Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the depreciation will also
result in price rise of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The first half of 1998 witnessed a decrease in
Cyprus' trade deficit by 1.2 percent compared to that of the same
period last year, report said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Statistics and Research Department
said that imports stood at 938.3 million Cyprus pounds (1,876.6
million dollars) from January to June of 1998, 600,000 pounds (1.2
million dollars) less than in the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The exports were 315.6 million pounds (631 million dollars) in
the first six months this year, compared to 308.5 million pounds
(617 million dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade deficit totaled 622.7 million pounds
(1,245.4 million dollars), 7.4 million pounds (14.8 million
dollars) less than that in the first half of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Trade Union to Restrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday called on the Histadrut (Trade Union)
to restrain its wage demand for sake of the nation.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in his Jerusalem office, Netanyahu said
that the Histadrut and the striking teachers "should show
responsibility for the nation."
</P>
<P>
He also accused the former Labor government of leaving the
country with a huge deficit of 15 billion shekels (about 4.1
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu expressed confidence in stablizing the economy,
saying Israel is now "an island of economic stability in the
stormy sea of international crisis."
</P>
<P>
He noted that if he had not acted to cut the national
overdraft, Israel would have had the same fate as Russia, whim
was near bankrupt due to a worsening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks after the Histadrut warned Monday
that it would stage a general strike on Thursday if no progress
was made in the negotiations with the Finance Ministry on its
demand for a 8 percent wage hike for the public sector's workers.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry is offering only 1 percent increase
for the wage hike.
</P>
<P>
If staged, the nationwide strike would affect all government
offices, the health system, local authorities, universities and
government corporations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli teachers already began a strike on Tuesday morning,
delaying the opening of the new school year and forcing 1.2
million students to stay at home.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says Violence "a Thing of the Past" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army, issued a statement Tuesday declaring
that violence is "a thing of the past -- over, done with, gone."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said in Belfast that everyone must
work to make sure last month's Omagh bombing -- which killed 28
people -- was "the last violent incident in our country" and that
Sinn Fein was committed to "making conflict a thing of the past."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief press spokesman
welcomed the move, calling the announcement "significant."
</P>
<P>
"It confirms the prime minister in his view that Sinn Fein
deserve to be taken seriously in their commitment to exclusively
peaceful means," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Adams made clear he had condemned the Omagh bombing -- carried
out by the Real IRA -- "without equivocation." The Real IRA is a
splinter of the IRA and has declared a cease-fire after claiming
responsibility to the Omagh bombing on August 15.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein has called for a complete halt to such actions and
has urged all armed groups to stop immediately," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein is committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic
means to achieve a way forward," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and the
first minister of the newly established Northern Ireland
parliament, gave the statement a cautious welcome.
</P>
<P>
"Carefully crafted words alone are not enough. The people of
Northern Ireland will now judge Sinn Fein on their actions over

<HEADLINE> Zambian Chiefs Urged to Help Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Traditional rulers in Zambia
are urged to play a major role in the development and marketing
of the country's tourism, the national tourist authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Angness Seen, Acting Chief Executive of the Zambia National
Tourist Board (ZNTB), said at the weekend that traditional rulers
and local administrations could come together and develop
bankable projects.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia's tourism will only make sense when traditional
rulers, other local authorities and key government departments
realize their major role in the development and marketing of the
industry," she said.
</P>
<P>
ZNTB and the Ministry of Tourism could advise on ideal tourist
facilities and activities in particular areas for inclusion in
the development plans, the acting chief suggested.
</P>
<P>
She said that attracting tourists to a particular area
depended much on accommodation, easy telecommunications and other
basic needs such as fresh water and food.
</P>
<P>
Despite various tourist attractions in Zambia which have
variety of offers, the inflow of tourists has been not very
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Zambia received 340,000
tourists and earned about 75.5 million U.S. Dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This year, ZNTB expects 400,000 tourist arrivals and 100
million U.S. Dollars from the industry.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says UNSCOM Affiliated to U.S. Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi spokesman said on
Tuesday that the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) was not a U.N. organization, rather it was affiliated to
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
In an statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the unnamed
spokesman said U.S. Ambassador to U.N. Bill Richardson's comment
on the resignation of American weapons inspector Scott Ritter
proved Iraq's charges that UNSCOM is dominated by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Ritter's resignation and U.S. media coverage of his
connections with Zionist Mossad (security service) and of UNSCOM
administration's links with the U.S State department and Central
Intelligence Agency all proved Iraq's earlier and repeated
assertion that UNSCOM was not a U.N. organization," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Rather," he added, "It is affiliated to the U.S government,
linked to the State Department and its espionage and terrorist
apparatus."
</P>
<P>
In a interview with CNN on Monday, Richardson praised Ritter,
who resigned from UNSCOM August 26 for what he called the
spinelessness of the U.N. Security Council and the U.S., saying
Ritter is a man of integrity, a great inspector, a good American
and a personal friend.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also commended U.N. chief inspector Richard
Butler, and admitted he had discussed with him technical matters
concerning commission's inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said, "Richardson spoke in exceptional
praise of only one among tens of UNSCOM inspectors, describing him
in a manner worthy of only those who rendered greater service to
the U.S. government."
</P>
<P>
He cited as evidence Richardson's acknowledgement of
coordination with Butler even in technical matters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the disclosure of such illegal connections
between a U.N. organization and the systems of a U.N. member
state made it incumbent on the U.N. secretary-general and the
Security Council to take necessary measures to straighten up the
situation of UNSCOM, break up its dubious links.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iraq's call for ending the eight-year sanctions
on the country following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions-stricken country announced to suspend cooperation with
UNSCOM on August 5, triggering the current standoff with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
However, the crippling sanctions on Iraq cannot be lifted
unless UNSCOM certifies that it has been free of weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> DRC Refugees in Tanzania Keeps Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of refugees
from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) entering Tanzania to
flee fierce civil war continue to increase as 263 of them arrived
in the Kigoma region in the west Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This brings the number of refugees from DRC who have entered
Tanzania over the past four weeks to more than 2,000, said a
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) officer in
Kigoma.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who preferred anonymity, clarified that all the
refugees are in good health and "none of them was injured."
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR has everything for them in terms of food,
ommodations and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UNHCR Kigoma sub-office head, J.F.Durieux, said all
refugees received are civilians and no rebellion soldiers are
among them.
</P>
<P>
The refugees crossed Lake Tanganyika by boat into Kigoma after
Tutsi-led rebels took up arms in Goma in the east of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has claimed that the influx of refugees is manageable,
as they are capable of handling even 1,000 new arrivals a day.
The refugees are taking shelter at Nyarugusu camp in the Kasulu
district.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Discuss Use of Weapons-Grade Uranium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian and U.S. officials held
talks here Tuesday on the utilization of weapons-grade uranium, a
spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held on the sidelines of the summit between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart, Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Acting Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov of Russia and U.S.
Energy Minister Bill Richardson, in their first round of talks,
also discussed implementation of an intergovernmental agreement on
deliveries of weapons-grade uranium to the U.S., the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Final documents are expected to be signed Wednesday, Tass
quoted a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee Pete Domenici, who
also attended the talks Tuesday, told reporters that a deal on
cutting stocks of weapons-grade uranium by 50 tons might be signed
at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the bilateral accord on uranium deliveries to
the U.S. is seen as the most acute problem in "nuclear contacts"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 document, 500 tons of uranium, taken from
dismantled nuclear weapons and processed from highly enriched to
low-enriched, would be delivered to the United States in the space
of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Russia would have to spend 150,000 tons of natural uranium to
"dilute" the weapons-grade uranium. Instead of paying money for
the expense, the U.S. was to compensate the uranium spent by
Russia with "a natural product."
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. law prohibits transfer of such material out of
the country, thereby barring Russia from trading it at will, Tass
said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Protests Looting of Its Offices in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Tuesday strongly protested widespread
looting over the last month by rebel forces of its offices in the
eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly concerned that, among the stolen items,
valued at more than 600,000 U.S. dollars, were nine tons of
nutritional biscuits meant to feed hundreds of malnourished
children. In addition, 10 vehicles essential to the delivery of
food and medical supplies to those in greatest need were also
taken," said UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
In Uvira, UNICEF's main sub-office and warehouse were totally
looted. In Bukavu, Goma and Kisangani, offices were destroyed and
communications equipment, vehicles and humanitarian supplies were
stolen.
</P>
<P>
In the western city of Boma, rebel forces seized three UNICEF
four-wheel drive vehicles. UNICEF and U.N. staff have been
threatened and intimidated at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has worked in the country for over three decades.
However, since 1991, there have been at least four major lootings
of UNICEF offices.
</P>
<P>
These lootings seriously undermine efforts to bring
humanitarian and development assistance to the country's 25
million children.

<HEADLINE> AL Team to Visit Libya on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) will
dispatch a high-level delegation to Libya Thursday to coordinate
the Arab stance on resolving the long-running Lockerbie crisis, a
senior Libyan diplomat said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-member delegation, headed by AL's Assistant
Secretary General Ahmad Adel, will submit a report to the AL
Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid upon its return, said
Libya's permanent delegate to the pan-Arab forum Salma Rashed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have recently agreed to try in the
Netherlands two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The bombing killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya last Wednesday accepted the joint U.S.-British proposal
but asked for clarifications on it.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting Tuesday with Abdel Meguid, Rashed
reiterated her country's keenness to secure guarantees for the two
Libyans before, during and after the trial planned somewhere in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed the Arab support for Libya's Lockerbie
stance. "The Arab position is backing that of Libya as well as the
Arab League proposal to allow the two suspects to go on trial in a
neutral country. This is the suggestion accepted by both Britain
and the U.S.," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan diplomat said that Meguid had not yet received a
reply from the British government on the guarantees required for
the Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
But the AL underlines the necessity of giving Libya enough time
to study the proposal on settling the Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
Still, she expected a positive development in the U.S.-British
position, noting that her country's approach to the Lockerbie case
is "firm, flexible and logical."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Thursday unanimously approved to
lift the sanctions against Libya once it hands over the two
suspects for trial. The U.N. has been imposing air and arms
embargoes on Libya since 1992 to force it to turn over the
suspects in the Lockerbie bombing.

<HEADLINE> S. African Electoral Bill Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Assembly Tuesday approved the Electoral Bill, which would
regulate next year's general election and all future polls in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Party (NP) and Democratic Party (DP)
voted against the legislation, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Dene Smuts of the DP predicted that a constitutional crisis
would result from an inability of the Home Affairs Department to
deliver the bar-coded IDs, as required by the bill, to all
potential voters in time.
</P>
<P>
About five million South Africans are believed to be not in
possession of the bar-coded IDs.
</P>
<P>
The DP supported the Independent Electoral Commission's
proposal to recognize all existing IDs, so that the Home Affairs
Department could concentrate on the 2.5 million voters who have
no such documents.
</P>
<P>
Frik van Deventer of the NP said that his party had supported
the idea of only bar-coded IDs being valid, but now it appeared
that the incompetent Home Affairs Department wanted to, at this
late stage, assure parliament it could deliver the estimated five
million outstanding documents.
</P>
<P>
The NP had therefore changed its stance and decided to vote
against the bill, van Deventer said.
</P>
<P>
Desmond Lockey of the ruling African National Congress (ANC),
who is chairman of parliament's home affairs portfolio committee,
said that his party believes the bill would provide a framework
for an orderly, free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
The government had provided an extra 35.6 million Rand (5.5
million U.S. Dollars) for the issuing of the bar-coded IDs, and
he had no doubt that the Home Affairs Department would be able to
meet the target.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Director-General Albert Mokoena also assured
parliament members that his department has the necessary capacity
to deliver the new IDs.
</P>
<P>
The bill now has to be considered by the National Council of
Provinces.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Keep Troops Along Border with Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Tuesday to
keep the troops and equipment participating in the ongoing massive
military maneuver on the country's northeastern border with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local reporters on the sidelines of the maneuver in
Khorasan province, Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC) Yahya Rahim Safavi said the 70,000-strong troops and
equipment will remain in the region.
</P>
<P>
They are part of the Ashura-3 military games, which started
Tuesday morning along the border with Afghanistan amid heightened
tensions, according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban militia, which now rules most of the
country, has been alleged to have kept in custody 11 Iranian
diplomats, a reporter and 35 truck drivers since its troops swept
into Mazar-e-Shrif, an opposition stronghold in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran is seeking the release of the captured through diplomatic
channels, but it has threatened to exploit all possible means to
ensure their safe return home.
</P>
<P>
Keeping more troops along the border is seen as a move to put
more pressure on the Taliban, which accused the arrested Iranians
of providing weapons and amunitions to the opposition Northern
Alliance, headed by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabani.
</P>
<P>
Safavi revealed that some 110 long- and medium-range artillery
units and 152 armored tanks equipped with advanced equipment
including T-22-S would be involved in the war games.
</P>
<P>
He said the massive maneuver was aimed to preserve battle
readiness of the IRGC troops and Basij (volunteer) forces,
exercise and evaluate the capabilities of the IRGC's rapid
deployment forces in encountering any unprecedented crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was also designed to test the movement and flexibility of
the IRGC's different units in operational fields and in advancing
into 40 kilometers depth of a hypothetical enemy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Boosting security across the eastern borders against the
mischieves and prevention of drug trafficking are also among the
objectives of the war games, the commander added.

<HEADLINE> UN Wants All Foreign Troops Out of DRC: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Tuesday that the U.N. does not
support foreign intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and would like all foreign troops to withdraw from the
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that his organization, like the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), respected the territorial
integrity of its member states.
</P>
<P>
"We do not support governments getting engaged in problems in
neighboring countries," Annan told reporters in Johannesburg. "We
want to see all foreign forces withdrawn from the DRC."
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of foreign troops should be followed by a
return to political dialog leading to elections in the war-torn
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan was making a stop-over in Johannesburg on his way to
Durban for the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit, which
would begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said during his stay in South Africa, he would try to get
all involved parties together to discuss the DRC issue in a bid
to find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he hoped to negotiate with the representatives of
various countries during the NAM summit about issues including
the DRC, Libya and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the U.N. stance on Sudan's insistence that the
recent United States bombing of a pharmaceutical plant be
investigated, Annan said that discussions were continuing before
the U.N. Security Council would decide on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would make a statement regarding Africa's
international debt on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament Tuesday
started debating a motion seeking to oblige the government and
rebels to a cease-fire and constitute a national compromise
commission.
</P>
<P>
The motion was tabled by Aggley Awoli, a member of parliament,
and seconded by some women MPs, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Aggley asserted that apart from poverty and ignorance, the
worst enemy to Ugandans since their independence is political
violence which has already claimed some two million lives.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the country is spending about 25 million
Ugandan Shillings (20,000 U.S. Dollars) per day to sustain the
operations of the government army and has spent 55 million U.S.
Dollars to purchase the weapons it needs.
</P>
<P>
There are mainly two groups of rebels active in Uganda: the
Lord's Resistance Army in the north and the Allied Democratic
Forces in the west. Having havens in a third country, these
rebels often infiltrate into Uganda to abduct and loot.
</P>
<P>
They also carry out terrorist activities throughout the
country. At present, two of Uganda's four divisions are
stationed in the north and west to counteract the offensives by
the rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Children as young as less than 10 years old can be abducted by
the rebels to reinforce their diminishing military might.
Sometimes, the majority of the attackers are children.
</P>
<P>
Taking rebel activities as a major threat to President Yoweri
Museveni's administration, the Ugandan authorities have tried to
boost the morale and military strength of government troops by
raising their wages and purchasing weapons from other countries.

<HEADLINE> Annan Promotes Small Loan Scheme for Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has urged U.N. systems to promote a small loan program
called Microcredit to benefit some 1.3 billion people in their
efforts to get rid of poverty, said a U.N. report made available
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his unprecedented report on the subject to the next U.N.
General Assembly one week away, Annan emphasized the
responsibilities of donor countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 microfinance institutions in developing countries
have been engaged in the project with the Grammeen Bank of
Bangladesh the most prominent, lending a cumulative 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars to over 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
Similar successful examples are known in Latin America and
Africa in providing loans, a few hundred dollars at most.
</P>
<P>
Women are a major beneficiary group and the destination of the
funds primarily includes agriculture, distribution, trading, small
craft and processing industries.
</P>
<P>
The report said the scheme has helped the poor to be more
self-reliant when they grasp employment opportunities. It also
supports small enterprise sector with some 500 million of the poor
employed in various countries.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank-led Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest has
allocated a portfolio of 218 million dollars for the coordination
of international Microcredit efforts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., in its first Decade for the Eradication of Poverty
(1997-2006), sees the program as an effective tool in freeing
people from poverty and have helped to increase their
participation in the economic and political processes of society.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries agreed last year to a plan extending small
loans to 100 million poor households by 2005, counting on
additional outlays of 26 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Annan said donors have a special responsibility to ensure that
financial intermediation programs are soundly based, operate
through solid local entities and involve the public sector.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Accusation of Interference in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday rejected the
accusation by Afghan Taliban militia of interfering in
Afghanistan's affairs by staging a massive military maneuver near
the border.
</P>
<P>
"We have never been involved in Afghanistan's internal
conflict and the Iranian consulates were busy with their routine
operations in the past few days in Herat and Jalalabad," Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the remarks in reaction to a statement by
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar claiming that he is holding 11
Iranian diplomats because 10,000 Afghan people were killed by
Iranian weapons.
</P>
<P>
Omar was apparently referring to Iran's support to the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance led by ousted Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that "we do not have prisoners of war in
Afghanistan and those taken captive by the Taliban are diplomats,
reporter, lorry drivers or relief workers."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran would do what it deems necessary to secure
the safety and release of the Iranian diplomats and citizens held
by Taliban early last month after its conquer of Mazari Sharif, a
major stronghold of the Northern Alliance in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He warned of "grave consequences" if the Taliban refuses to
release the detained Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iranian military exercise along its eastern
borders with Afghanistan, Mohammadi said "it is a warning to those
who violate international regulations and try to damage the
national security and interest of Iran."
</P>
<P>
"Any hostile act against the Islamic Republic of Iran will be
responded strongly," he added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The three-nation
commission of inquiry assigned to investigate the alleged
election rigging in Lesotho's May general election completed its
work in capital Maseru Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the commission, Judge Pius Langa of South Africa's
Constitutional Court, said Tuesday that the commission had
completed investigations in 71 of the 80 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
He said the electoral documents have all been examined except
for documents relating to nine constituencies, which are still

</P>
<P>
He said the final report would be presented within days to the

Lesotho's opposition parties demand an annulment of the
results of the May election, in which the ruling Lesotho Congress

the tiny mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said that the election was rigged and the

<HEADLINE> DRC Demands Uganda, Rwanda Withdraw Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) JC Okoto Tuesday demanded
Uganda and Rwanda withdraw their troops from the DRC territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Durban, Okoto said that his
government could not accept a cease-fire before Uganda and Rwanda
have withdrawn their troops from the DRC land.
</P>
<P>
Okoto, who is here to attend the 12th Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) summit, said: "As we have never invited Ugandan and Rwandan
troops to our country, they should have left from our country."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the deployment of troops from Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia, Okoto insisted that the DRC government has the right
to ask friendly countries to provide necessary protection.
</P>
<P>
Following series of strong offensives by the rebel forces
against President Laurent Kabila's government, Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia sent their troops and arms to the DRC earlier last
month to support Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Okoto called on all the countries, including member states of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) which are
interested in the DRC issues, to play positive roles in solving
the current crisis in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
On general election issue, Okoto said that the DRC government
never opposed democratic polls, but such election must be held in
accordance with the government's plan.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Seek Closer Ties with Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said on Tuesday that Turkey will make greater efforts
to strengthen its relations with Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting attended by six Turkish ambassadors to
Latin America, Cem said the Foreign Ministry would hammer out a
systematic policy to that effect, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Latin America is of vital importance for Turkey and opening up
to this continent will be one of Turkey's major priorities in
1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Turkey's priority regarding Latin America
would be to establish close economic ties, which could further
promote development of political relations.
</P>
<P>
Korkmaz Haktanir, the foreign undersecretary, said that
Turkey's recent aim is to obtain the observer status in a number
of Latin American organizations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's ambassadors to Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico,
Cuba and Chile, who are accredited to a total of 22 countries in
the region, stressed the importance of developing closer
Turkish-Latin American ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz is expected to visit
Mexico late this month and Cem will travel to Brazil, Argentina
and Chile in October, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Turkey's plan to enhance ties with
Latin American countries is aimed at exploring new markets and
rallying support for its positions on regional issues.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG to Move Headquarters to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG will soon move its headquarters from Monrovia in
Liberia to Sierra Leone, defense source said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Godwin Ugbo, acting spokesman of the Nigerian Defense
Headquarters told reporters at a news briefing that about 90
percent of ECOMOG forces are already in Sierra Leone, so it is
proper for the headquarters to be close to the troops.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that about 8,000 Nigerian soldiers in three
brigades are now in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was formed in 1990 soon after the breakout of the
Liberian civil war and played a major role in ending the war in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor, a former warlord who won
the elections monitored by the ECOMOG, has expressed
dissatisfaction with the continued presence of ECOMOG troops in
his country after the war.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG entered Sierra Leone soon after the May 1997 coup
of Major Koroma. Though the peacekeeping force drove out
Koroma's men from capital Freetown in February 1998, the junta
forces have managed to survive in the northeast border area.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ugbo explained that it has been hard for the ECOMOG to
mop up the rebels because the latter are taking advantage of the
difficult terrains in the area and are used to jungle warfare.

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Health Coverage for Uninsured Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
announced measures Tuesday to bring coverage to more uninsured
children.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the reach of federal agencies would be used to enroll
children eligible for coverage under Medicaid or state programs
but have not been signed up. He said many families are unaware
that their children qualify for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
"Now, of course, we face perhaps an even tougher challenge;
actually finding and enrolling the hardest to reach children," he
said. "Millions of children who are actually eligible for coverage
remain without coverage."
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department said it would encourage states to
use the school lunch program -- which serves 15 million pupils --
to sign up uninsured children. The Housing and Urban Development
Department plans to enlist housing authority workers and other
people it deals with in spreading the word.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Department employees who focus on low-income programs,
such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, will be asked to help enroll
children as well.
</P>
<P>
Gore also announced 1.6 million dollars to renew health
projects in rural communities and said the administration had
approved three more states -- Delaware, Kansas and Iowa -- for the
Children's Health Insurance Program. Most states are part of the
program, which helps them provide coverage to children in working
families.
</P>
<P>
Some 11 million children have no health insurance and almost as
many have inadequate plans or live in places without enough
doctors, said Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health
Fund. The group's vans serve as mobile clinics that treat children
and helped the uninsured get enrolled.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- French researchers said
that they have found a new HIV strain in a 40-year-old woman in
Cameroon, and they said that the new strain of HIV is genetically
close to a version that infects non-human primates such as
chimpanzees, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists, HIV constantly evolves into new
strains, even as researchers develop new combinations of therapies
to control its proliferation. In the past two years, new HIV
strains also have been discovered in Thailand and India.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said the genetic profile of the new strain is
closer to the genes of versions of the viruses found in
chimpanzees and other non-human primates. It is not certain how
the Cameroon woman contracted the strain, but the genetic profile
suggests it may have been transmitted from another species.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Calls for Urgent Measures to Build </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin Tuesday ordered the Central Bank, the Finance
Ministry and the Tax Service to come up with urgent measures to
boost people's confidence.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of acting ministers, Chernomyrdin listed the
priorities as the insurance of people's deposits, restoration of
the foreign currency market, a balanced exchange rate policy,
preservation of the banking system, strengthening of banks'
liquidity and improved control over foreign currency operations.
</P>
<P>
"Pulling out of the crisis greatly depends today on restoring
confidence in authorities," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted him
as saying after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The government needs clear-cut, hard and understandable work.
The measures which we have to take should be convincing as we have
exhausted a limit of errors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prices continued rising Tuesday as the official exchange rate
for the ruble dropped to 10.883 rubles to the dollar, breaking the
ceiling of the exchange corridor of 9.5 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Fare for the Moscow metro system rose from two rubles to three
rubles as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin ordered Tax Service head Boris Fyodorov, acting
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank chairman Sergei
Dubinin to finalize their positions and "arrive at a set of
immediate joint measures by September 3."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin demanded that a "practical consideration of
proposals on the tax reform" start immediately. "We would not
survive without a tax reform that would encourage production."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he instructed the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and
the Ministry of Finance to consider the excise issue by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be slow, especially in case of oil companies,"
Chernomyrdin said. "The limit of mistakes has been exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was making all the moves despite a vote Monday by
the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, to overwhelmingly
reject his nomination as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin has renominated him as premier, but the
defiant Duma is likely to block the nomination on the second round
of voting, possibly next Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the nomination is rejected
by Duma three times, the president will have to submit a new
nominee or dissolve the lower chamber.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Palestinians, Syria Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu called on Palestinian and Syrian leaders
Tuesday to resume negotiations with his government, saying only
it can bring about peace.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a business forum in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said
that Israel was "very close" to a deal on the next troop
withdrawal from the West Bank with the Palestinians two days ago,
but the Palestinians retreated.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the Palestinians come back to the
table, and restore and move on the understandings we achieved
in the negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the Palestinians over the long overdue
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank remain deadlocked following
short-lived optimism late last month.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the latest Israeli proposal on
making changes to the U.S. initiative calling for a 13.1 percent
pullback. Israel wants to turn 3 percent of the West Bank into a
natural reserve, where it retains security control and the
Palestinians will not be allowed to build.
</P>
<P>
On another stalled track of peace process, Netanyahu renewed
his call for Syrian President Hafez Assad to resume negotiations
with Israel, which have been suspended since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I call on President Assad and Mr. Arafat to resume
negotiations for peace with security with the one government of
Israel that can deliver a peace that will be backed by the
entire people of Israel. They can not afford to miss this
opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria have failed to resolve their disputes in the
last two years over how to restart the peace talks. Israel wanted
the talks to be resumed from scratch, but Syria insists they be
revived from where they were left off more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Syria said the former Israeli Labor government had agreed
in principle in the negotiations to withdraw from the Golan
Heights, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu-led government refuses to make such promise,
citing that the Golan Heights is vital to its strategic security.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has stated repeatedly that without an Israeli
commitment to withdrawal from the Golan, Syria will not agree to
come back to the negotiating table.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station chief in Tel Aviv
and top Palestinian security officials last week.
</P>

The talks, reported for the first time Tuesday, were held with
an aim to help the Israelis and the Palestinians reach an
agreement on a CIA-brokered memorandum of understanding (MOU) on
security cooperation, Haaretz said.

LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony

<P>
A Downing Street spokesman was quoted by Reuters as saying
Blair held telephone consultations with Italian Prime Minister

countries until the situation in Russia became clear.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Commuters may now have a
chance to enjoy better services by public transport systems after
the European Commission has found out what needs to be improved
and how.
</P>
<P>
The commission launched a project to compare public transport
systems in 15 cities and regions in nine European countries, the
commission announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Public authorities and operators responsible for local and
regional passenger transport should be able to compare the
performance of their transport system with good practice
elsewhere, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
The comparison will help them to understand how they can
improve and give them an incentive to act.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the commission project of comparing public
transport systems are Oulu in Finland, Bremen, Stuttgart and
Dresden in Germany, Graz in Austria, Athens in Greece, Lisbon in
Portugal, Temi and Genoa in Italy, Nantes and Ile-de-France in
France, Merseyside, Glasgow and Edinburgh in Britain as well as
Prague in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, is funding a special project that is designed to define the
benchmark for local passenger transport systems.
</P>
<P>
The commission also considered to award, from 1999 onwards,
quality labels or special prizes to encourage the use of public
transport benchmarks for quality services in European cities.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Russia to Stay on Strategic Reform Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said
here Tuesday that Russia will stay on the course of its strategic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner in honor of visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Yeltsin said the last two years have been full of stormy political
developments and patient efforts at reforming the economy.
</P>
<P>
"True, we experienced disappointments and failed hopes, but we
have always believed that the changes we were carrying out were
essential," the Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived here Tuesday morning on a three-day visit,
met with Yeltsin and ranking officials. He is scheduled to have
more talks with Yeltsin and leaders of Russia's major political
parties and movements on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say that all the problems are behind us. The social
cost of the reform is great. Time is needed for the government's
stabilization program to bear fruit," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"But as president I declare: Russia's strategic reform course
is inevitable," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Russian-U.S. ties, Yeltsin said Much has been done in the
past years to boost bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is built on a solid basis. The relations of friendship,
openness and mutual respect that I have with Bill Clinton are very
helpful in this," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Russian-U.S. partnership in international
affairs represents a major factor in world stability and security.
</P>
<P>
"What the future will bring to the peoples of the planet, peace
and prosperity or conflicts and uncertainty, largely depends on
the leaders of Russia and the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
After Russia, Clinton will travel to Ireland and the British
province of Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Court Expects 1st Judgement on Crime of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) will hand down the first ever
judgement on the crime of genocide by an international court and
pronounce in a separate case the first ever sentence for the 1994
Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
In the dock now are Jean-Paul Akayesu, who was the mayor of
Rwanda's Taba District and whose verdict will be pronounced
Wednesday, and more significantly, Jean Kambanda, who was the
country's Prime Minister during the genocide, and has pleaded
guilty. Kambanda's sentence will be announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a ICTR statement faxed to Xinhua, the trial and
judgement of Akayesu will be the first ever for the crime of
genocide by an international court.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu was indicted on 15 counts of genocide, crimes against
humanity, and violations of the Geneva convention, including
extermination, murder, torture, and rape, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda on May 1 this year became the first person to accept
culpability for genocide before an international court, it said,
adding that his sentence on Friday will be the first for
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda was accused of presiding over meetings of the Rwandan
Council of Ministers at which massacres against Tutsis were
discussed.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR is the first international body charged specifically
with prosecuting crimes of genocide. The maximum sentence the
tribunal can impose is life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR, based in Arusha, north Tanzania, was created by the
United Nations Security Council in November of 1994 after one of
the intense periods of mass exterminations in human history.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
were brutally massacred in just three months in the middle of
that year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
before leaving for the 12th Non-Aligned Summit in Durban, South
Africa on August 30, said that "the success of this court in
prosecuting genocide is a historic milestone and a defining
example of the ability of the United Nations to create
institutions which fulfill the highest aspirations of mankind."
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has in its custody a total of 26 indicted
Rwandans and five suspects.
</P>
<P>
All the 31 come from what Tribunal Registrar Agwu Okali calls
"the commanding heights" of Rwanda's governing elite during the
time the genocide took place. They were arrested by countries
across Africa and Europe and delivered to the tribunal in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another accused, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a
Pastor, is being held in Texas in the United States. A U.S.
federal judge ordered his deportation to Arusha on August 5 but
he has one month in which to appeal.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal's next major challenge will be to find the
countries which will accept for incarceration those found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Norway and Denmark have definitively indicated their
willingness to take some of those convicted, and a number of
African states and others have opened negotiations with tribunal
officials as well.
</P>
<P>
However, the tribunal prefers that as many of the convicted as
possible be convicted within Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Jump High in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide orders
to factories and plants jumped 1.2 percent in July, the best
performance since last November, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Orders totaled a seasonally adjusted 335.2 billion U.S.
dollars, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
July was the second month of recovery in factory orders from a
2.2 percent May drop that was the biggest in three years. In June,
orders picked up 0.3 percent, slightly more than originally
reported.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the crisis in Asia, U.S. factory orders from April
to June were 0.7 percent below the first three months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
In July, orders for durable goods were up 1.9 percent to 186.4
billion dollars. This represented a slight downward revision from
a preliminary estimate of a 2.4 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic equipment were up 10 percent in July, as
compared with a 12.8 percent drop in demand for communications
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, orders for industrial machinery took a strong 1.9
percent increase, led by gains in demand for engines, turbines and
metalworking machinery. However, orders for the category that
includes computers fell by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. computer manufacturers have been among the hardest hit by
stiff competition from cheaper Asian products.
</P>
<P>
Car production also suffered this summer by a strike at General
Motors. In July, orders for cars and other automotive products
were down 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nondurable goods rose 0.4 percent in July to 148.8
billion dollars, led by books and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipments, a measure of current production, were
down 0.1 percent in July to 334.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders grew 0.1 percent, the first
increase since April, to 529.8 billion dollars. Inventories of
unsold goods were up 0.3 percent to 468.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Seek Approval to Handle Renminbi Transactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Six foreign banks in Shenzhen,
a major city in south China, have submitted applications to the
People's Bank of China (PBOC) seeking approval to handle Renminbi
transactions, according to PBOC Vice-Governor Liu Mingkang.
</P>
<P>
Liu told Xinhua that the central bank will examine the
applications in accordance with related procedures and management
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the licenses "might be issued in the near future."
</P>
<P>
China granted nine foreign banks in Shanghai's New Pudong
Development Area approval to conduct Renminbi transactions in
December 1996. Said banks have since enjoyed smooth developments
in terms of related business activities.
</P>
<P>
The nine banks reported total assets of 1.16 billion yuan by
the end of June this year, with their total outstanding loans
approaching 603 million yuan and total deposits hitting 763
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the PBOC granted Shenzhen approval as the second
locality to undertake experiments with foreign banks engaged in
Renminbi transactions, with the New Pudong Area receiving approval
to allow additional foreign banks to engage in related activities.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that allowing foreign banks to handle Renminbi
transactions has provided new opportunities for the institutions
to explore market potential and promote business development. The
practice has also provided valuable experience for opening China's
banking sector to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Expanding the scope of related experiments is a necessary part
of China's economic and financial development, and demonstrates
the Chinese government's firm commitment to further open the
financial sector," according to Liu.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Stricken Areas Urged to Prepare for Onslaught of Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
called on governments in flood-stricken areas to make every effort
to help flood victims survive the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
Zhu conducted a fact-finding tour in disaster areas in
northeastern China from August 28-September 2. The premier said
efforts must concentrate on the construction of housing prior to
the arrival of winter.
</P>
<P>
He noted that people can raise funds themselves and either
obtain bank loans or donated funds. Local governments should also
subsidize housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Flood victims can either borrow grain from the government, or
trade labor for grain products. Flood victims will mainly depend
on donations for winter clothing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the Ministry of Civil Affairs to organize and
coordinate the transportation of winter goods and priority should
be given to flood-ravaged regions in northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in northeastern China have dropped to around 10
degrees Celsius at night and the onslaught of winter arrives in
less than a month.
</P>
<P>
The premier visited counties which sustained heavy damage
during the severe flooding. He also visited people living in tents
and makeshift shelters and encouraged them to employ self-reliance
when reconstructing.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also urged concerned departments to stockpile adequate
supplies of seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides to support
winter and spring cultivation in disaster-stricken areas.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Sacked Malaysian Deputy PM Anwar Ibrahim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim was sacked with effect
from 5.30 p.m. Wednesday, as was officially announced Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Anwar has also been removed from all other positions held by
him in his capacity as deputy prime minister and minister of
finance, a short statement issued by the Prime Minister's
Department late Wednesday evening said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 51, was appointed deputy prime minister on December 1,
1993, succeeding Tun Ghafar Baba.
</P>
<P>
Anwar made a name for himself as a radical student leader in
the early 1970's.
</P>
<P>
He was brought into the government by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad in 1982 when he was initially made a deputy minister in
the Prime Minister's Department.
</P>
<P>
He was later promoted to full minister, moving from the
portfolio of the then Culture, Youth and Sports Ministry in June
1983, the Agriculture Ministry (July 1984) and the Education
Ministry (May 1986) and he was appointed finance minister in March
1991.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also had a rise in the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO). He joined the party in 1982 and became the
UMNO Youth leader in the year and retained the post at a
subsequent party election and went on to win one of the three
vice-president's posts in 1987.
</P>
<P>
He was re-elected vice-president with the highest number of
votes at the next party polls in 1990 and became deputy president
in 1993 when Ghafar Baba stepped down.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Anwar was again returned unopposed as UMNO's No. 2. He
was declared as successor of Mahathir who came to power in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Besides his government and political posts, Anwar also held
posts in several committees, clubs and associations. He was
chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Malpractices in the
government, deputy chairman of the National Information Technology
Council and deputy president of the National Telecommunication
Council. He was appointed earlier this year deputy chairman of the
National Economic Action Council.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was appointed chairman of the Development Council of the
World Bank/International Monetary Fund in April this year for a
two-year term.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is Member of Parliament for Permatang Pauh, a seat in
Pulau Pinang, a northern state in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, a graduate from the University of Malaya, received his
secondary education at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar, an elite
school reputed for producing many of the country's leaders in
government and business.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was president of the Malaysian Youth Council (1972-76)
and president of the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement (1974-1982).
</P>
<P>
He has been president of the International Islamic University
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is married to Wan Azizah Wan Ismail and they have six
children.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Premier Defines Two Main Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A new constitution and seeking
international support represent two overriding tasks for Albania
at present, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting of the Presidium of the
Socialist Party, which focused on Albania's current situation and
the party's future work, the Voice of People newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Successful completion of anyone of the tasks will greatly
enhance the function of the government and its image both among
the people and its foreign partners, he said.
</P>
<P>
More important, Nano said, completion of the tasks, one on law
and another on economy, will bring the Albanian people what they
are dreaming of.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all governmental departments and branches to poll
efforts in turning such a promising future into reality.
</P>
<P>
Albania's former Democratic Party administration drafted a
constitution which was turned down in a referendum last year.
</P>
<P>
The current People's Assembly, headed by the Socialist Party,
put the constitution-drawing on its agenda shortly after its
formation last year.
</P>
<P>
However, hindered by the opposition parties, the
constitution-drawing work is going forward very slowly.
</P>
<P>
Assistance from the international community also has been
suspended or postponed since the outbreak of a nationwide turmoil
last year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for more efforts to strengthen
security at home, so as to create an environment favorable for
foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Warns to Take Actions Against Possible U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz warned on Wednesday that Iraq will take further
decisive actions to protect its interests and security if the
U.N. Security Council adopts a hostile resolution against it.
</P>
<P>
Aziz was commenting in a statement on a draft resolution
submitted by the United States and Britain to the Security Council
proposing the council's review of sanctions on Iraq every 60 days
be suspended.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify what steps Iraq would take if the
resolution is passed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. trade embargo since 1990 when
it invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Suspending the review of sanctions, so far held for 40 times
with no result achieved, means nothing to Iraq other than
confirming the fact that continued dealing with UNSCOM is of no
use," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on August 5 to suspend cooperation with the
UNSCOM, the U.N. special commission charged with overseeing
disarmament of Iraq, accusing it of being dominated and used by
the U.S. as a tool to prolong the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the adoption of the draft resolution by the
Security Council would implicate that the council attaches no
seriousness to Iraq's legitimate demands, which he said should not
be ignored.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that "he who imagines that Iraq could revoke,
under such pressures, threats or whatever, its decision of August
5, is only under a grand illusion."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been calling for the lifting of U.N. sanctions,
arguing that it has fully cooperated with the UNSCOM and destroyed
all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM should issue a clean bill of health on Iraq before
the U.N. Security Council can lift the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Calls for New Nominee for Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President
Nachagyn Bagabandy urged the ruling coalition on Wednesday to find
a new candidate for premiership within this week to end the
month-long political standoff.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President of the Mongolian National Democratic
Party Tsakhiya Elbegdorj and Chairman of the Mongolian Social
Democratic Party Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, Bagabandy asked the
two partners of the ruling coalition to nominate a new candidate
for him to confirm.
</P>
<P>
The candidate should also be approved by the Great Hural (the
Mongolian parliament) after confirmation by the president.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural on Wednesday rejected the candidacy of
R. Amarjargal, acting minister of external affairs, saying that no
minister of the former government should become new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Under fire for a bank merger, Mongolia's three-month old
coalition government led by Elbegdorj was dismissed on July 24
after losing a vote of confidence in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the coalition repeatedly nominated Davaadorj
Ganbold, chairman of the Standing Committee of Economic Policy of
the Great Hural, who was turned down by the president five times.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the political crisis in Mongolia would
deepen amid the naming of a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the minority Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party made a statement recently, saying that the
unicameral Great Hural should be dissolved if it fails to appoint
a prime minister in the near future.

reigns of King Wuding to King Zhou in the Shang
Dynasty. Researchers will consult ancient astronomical almanacs
which will provide an exact chronicle of the late period of the
dynasty, said Li.

<P>
Liu Ciyuan, a research fellow with Shaanxi Astronomical
Observatory, and his team observed the eclipse on March 9, 1997,
in Tacheng Prefecture in the westernmost section of the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The team was determined that the special record found in the
ancient version of the chronicle referred to a solar
eclipse. Careful calculations enabled astronomers to confirm
that the eclipse occurred on April 21, 899 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Historians also consulted a complete set of ancient documents
covering periods before the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and materials
for the period after the Song Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The research endeavor was initiated in May, 1996, and numerous
well-known historians have since worked on more than 30 specified
subjects.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Urges Chernomyrdin to Give up Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on
Wednesday passed a resolution to urge acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to voluntarily reject the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed 255-40 with no abstentions in the
lower house of parliament, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Your voluntary rejection of the position of prime minister
could significantly reduce the tension and lead to a search for a
compromise," the document says.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was nominated by President Boris Yeltsin as prime
minister on August 25, but the nomination was rejected
overwhelmingly by the State Duma on Monday in the first round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
The Duma resolution, to be addressed to Chernomyrdin in the
form of a letter, said his nomination "has resulted in a tough
confrontation between branches of the authority."
</P>
<P>
"Continued attempts by President Yeltsin to force your
appointment through parliament are doomed," said the letter,
drafted by members of the Communist, Yabloko, Agrarian, Popular
Rule and Russian Regions groups, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the ultranationalist Liberal
Democratic Party, who on Monday named himself a candidate for the
premiership, changed sides on Wednesday, saying he supports
Chernomyrdin's nomination.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is scheduled to hold a second round of voting on
Chernomyrdin's nomination on Friday. Most opposition parties have
indicated that they would vote against him.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian constitution, if the Duma blocks nomination of
the premiership three times, the president will have to either
name a new candidate or dissolve the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
However, Wednesday's letter to Chernomyrdin says that "the
dissolution of the State Duma will not alleviate the
crisis. Rather, it will bring about irreconcilable political
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"Chernomyrdin has found himself in the center of a conflict
and now has to make a decision which will shape the fate of the
entire country as well as his own," the document said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Wednesday welcomed Sinn Fein's decision to disarmament,
saying it was proof that the Northern Ireland peace process was
moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, appointed its chief
negotiator Martin McGuinness on Wednesday as go-between for the
IRA and the independent body on arms decommissioning charged with
overseeing the scrapping of weapons by Northern Ireland's
guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman said the prime minister believed
"the peace process is moving in the right direction,"
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said in a statement that all
participants in the peace agreement must now act with renewed
commitment to all its terms and remove all guns from the
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"This statement by Gerry Adams is an important practical step
in that process. It underlines the determination of the
signatories to the Good Friday agreement to fulfil all their
obligations," Blair's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace agreement, signed in April, "must be
implemented as a whole and that includes decommissioning of
weapons by all paramilitary organizations within the time scale
laid out," he added.

<HEADLINE> Historians Create Complete Chronology for Chinese History (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese historians are
attempting to unravel the chronology of the nation's 5,000 years
of development.
</P>
<P>
The existing historical chronicle for China, one of the world's
four ancient civilized nations, begins in 841 B.C., with no
precise record for nearly half of the nation's remote history.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government organized a project to determine
precise dates for the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties which featured
the spread of abundant legends and anecdotes. The major study
focuses on events some 2,800-4,000 years ago and in accurately
apportioned the lengths of the three dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The Henan Institute of Cultural Relics and Archeology recently
completed excavations at Wadian in Yuxian County, an area in the
central part of the province which experts surmise was the
residing place for ancient people in the Xia Dynasty (22-17 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Researchers have ascertained that the Longshan Culture was
divided into three stages and five periods. Excavations of ruins
at Wangchenggang, near Dengfeng, verified the previous theory and
yielded well over 200 prime samples for extensive experiments.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that various layers at both sites dated to earlier
periods than those at sites for the Erlitou Culture suggest we
might find the origins of the Xia Dynasty," according to Li
Xueqin, director of the Institute of Archeology under the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
The CASS obtained numerous samples containing adequate amounts
of carbon from Yanshi and were thus able to precisely date the
Erlitou sites.
</P>
<P>
They also unearthed the foundation for a three-story palace and
the ruins of the small town built long before larger towns in the
Shang Dynasty. The discovery enabled the researchers to establish a
timetable for the town's construction.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Bargain-hunting investor Tuesday plowed through the wreckage
of Wall Street's Monday market rout, sending the Down Jones
industrial average soaring 288.36 points in a day marked by wide
price swings, jittery trading and record volume.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy remains so solid that the stock market's
decline from its July peak will merely slow growth of the nation's
economic output and will not come close to causing a recession, a
number of public and private economists said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday delivered a sober
lecture to Russian leaders and the Russian people about the hard
realities of the capitalism and the price of international support
for relief from Russia's current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- Europe and the United States shunted aside a call from Japan
for an emergency meeting of the world's largest economies to deal
with Russia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The annual U.N. population survey says the global growth
rate has slowed to 1.4 percent a year from two percent in 1960,
and the biggest increases are occurring among the very old and the
very young.
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslavia's Milosevic offered Kosovo Albanians "a degree of
self-rule," but his plan fell short of demands by rebels and
international mediators.

<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Former England manager Bobby
Robson predicted that Paul Gascoigne would look back on his
career with regrets.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Wednesday, Robson, who gave
Gascoigne his England debut 10 years ago, said: "It is too late
for him to change now."
</P>
<P>
"There will be a day, I'm sure, when Paul is in his rocking
chair looking back and he will know he's wasted some of his
career.
</P>
<P>
"He's had a bit of a mis-spent youth and many times over his
career he's over-drank, and had a weight problem -- and he's done
bizarre, pretty stupid things.
</P>
<P>
"You can't change him because he's a special boy, a loveable
boy. I like him enormously and took pride in trying to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
"But you can't be with these kind of people 24 hours a day.
There's a time when they go off and do stupid things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robson, coach at PSV in the Netherlands, believed that nobody
could change Gascoigne at 31 -- not even his Middlesbrough
manager Bryan Robson.
</P>
<P>
"It is too late for Paul to change his life," added Robson. "I
presume he still likes a drink and still likes to do stupid
things. He won't change that."

<P>
Jayasinghe, 22, whose suspension was lifted last week by IAAF,
said she was not in a proper mood to compete at the Games slated

</P>
<P>
"I did a time test yesterday and found that I don't have speed
endurance. This is because I am not yet in a proper mental state

</P>
<P>
However, she said she will be ready to compete in the Asian
Games in Bangkok in December.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe sprang to fame after winning the silver medal in
the women's 200 meters at last year's World Championships in

ring, Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said.
</P>
<P>
Vanstone said Australian police were involved across two states
as part of a worldwide operation, coordinated by the National
Crime Squad of England and Wales, which had dismantled the ring.
</P>
<P>
In one of Australia's biggest law enforcement operations,
police from the states of Western Australia and New South Wales
took part, supported by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and
Interpol.
</P>
<P>
In all, 15 countries were involved, including Germany, France,
Italy and the United States, with dozens of suspected paedophiles
believed to have been arrested in raids at more than 11 addresses,
including four in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Vanstone said the operation had recovered more than 100,000
indecent images of children.
</P>
<P>
"Crimes against children are amongst the most appalling in any
society and the AFP and the international law enforcement agencies
involved deserve strong praise for their efforts in bringing those
allegedly involved in this child pornography ring to justice," she
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In London, one of the coordinators of the international police
operation said Australian officials had raided "about four"
properties as part of the worldwide swoop, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Detective Superintendent John Stewardson, of Britain's National
Crime Squad, said it was unclear at this stage whether anyone had
been producing child pornography in Australia or whether those
targeted had just been exchanging the images.
</P>
<P>
"They've been exchanging it - whether they've been producing it
as well in Australia we don't know at this stage," he told the
AAP.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also unclear whether any children had been
abused in Australia as part of the child porn Internet club, which
operated under the name of Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
Police in the state of West Australia raided two Perth homes as
part of the operation, with two men being interviewed, although no
charges had been laid.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle: Adams' Book Brings Us Even Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle
insisted on Wednesday that he has "no problems" with Tony Adams,
despite the central defender's criticisms against him in his new
book.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said that they are now even closer as a result of the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
Adams has criticised Hoddle for making crucial mistakes during
the World Cup in the serialisation of his forthcoming book
"Addicted" in The Sun newsppaer this week.
</P>
<P>
But Hoddle, facing the media during England training at
Burnham Beeches, denied the book has caused a rift with his most
experienced player.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been a problem between me and Tony," said the
coach, sitting side by side with Adams.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a good chat and in many ways it has brought us
closer together."
</P>
<P>
And Shearer also played down any talk of a dispute over
Adams'belief that he should be England captain.
</P>
<P>
"He would say that wouldn't he, because he's Tony Adams,"
Shearer told Radio 5 Live.
</P>
<P>
"He's entitled to his opinion. But the fact of the matter is
I'm England captain and that's end of subject as far as I'm
concerned."
</P>
<P>
On the playing front Hoddle suffered a setback ahead of
Saturday's opening European Championship qualifier against Sweden
in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
West Ham central defender Rio Ferdinand has been ruled out
with a groin strain he aggravated against Coventry last
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> England to Ban Super League Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association (FA)
of England gave a stern warning on Wednesday that England players
whose clubs decide to break away into a European Super League
will be banned from the international game.
</P>
<P>
FA chairman Keith Wiseman's threat comes in the week that
Premier League chairmen meet to discuss the controversial plans.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool have already been
invited by the company behind the Super League plans, Media
Partners, to take part in a new structure outside the remit of FA
and UEFA.
</P>
<P>
Wiseman announced that all players with breakaway clubs would
be excluded from the England set-up, but he insisted the blanket
ban would only be considered in "an extreme situation".
</P>
<P>
He said: "I have every reason to believe the clubs will reach
accommodation with UEFA and the FA over the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
"But I think the point is that those seeking the breakaway
have not taken account of is they are talking about playing
unsanctioned football entirely outside the jurisdiction of the
whole football body.
</P>
<P>
"I think it logically follows from that they are not able to
play inside it as well."
</P>
<P>
Wiseman accepted there was an inexorable movement towards more
European games, but believed these can be accommodated within the
existing league arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a European League almost certainly
within the next few years, hopefully from under the structure of
the game and with consultation taking place with the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
"I think the structure of the game will survive and I think it
is vital that it does. One only has to look at the problems a
sport like rugby union has at the moment to realise how difficult
it can be for everyone if there is no clear structure laid
down."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Turns Away Foreign Workers for Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is curtailing jobs for
foreigners so as to see more locals employed, the semi-official
Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Regulations have been adopted to bar guest workers from filling
15 kinds of positions like accountancy, teaching and office work,
Minister of Labor Mohammad Mahdi Farhan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the ministry has recently requested hotels and
other tourism businesses to refrain from employing non-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, job opportunities will be added for Jordanians in
the sectors that deny jobs to quest workers, especially tourism,
Farhan said.
</P>
<P>
By barring non-Jordanians from more occupations, the ministry
intends to make job vacancy and help the unemployed Jordanians
hired, he added.
</P>
<P>
Officials put the unemployment in locals at 100,000, but
independent sources placed it as high as 1.2 million, or 26
percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
There are now 600,000 non-Jordanians working in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Non-Jordanians find jobs more easily than Jordanians as they
get lower wages and ask no health insurance from employers.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Demands Better Investment Structure in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has
suggested Jordan to adjust investment structure and speed up
privatization so as to revive its national economy, said a Jordan
Businessmen Association (JBA) statement obtained here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by John Page, the WB's chief economist
for the Middle East and North Africa Region, during a
JBA-sponsored meeting on Tuesday in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has to adjust the current investment
structure by directing the investors' priorities towards the
productive sector rather than building houses in order to create
"a balance between commercial and non-commercial investments,"
said Page.
</P>
<P>
A balanced investment structure, plus a healthy ratio of
investment to the gross domestic products (GDP), will contribute
much to reviving Jordan's economy, whose growth rates almost
grounded to zero in the past few years, said Page.
</P>
<P>
He added that Jordan's current ratio of investment to the GDP
stands at 23 to 24 percent, which is "satisfactory" in accordance
with regional standards.
</P>
<P>
The present investment structure in Jordan is not reasonable,
as most investors focus on house-building projects instead of
productive industrial ones due to a natural fear that any
investment in industry might be ruined as a result of the
unstable regional circumstance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Page said, the Jordanian government needs to speed
up its privatization program in conjunction with the adjustment of
investment structure to revive the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan needs to privatize its institutions, which will make
private sector investment more profitable" through fully
implementing the privatization program launched in early 1990s,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be beneficial to the government to give the private
sector the opportunity to play "a major role" in the economy,
said Page.
</P>
<P>
Page paid his visit to Jordan, at a time when the Jordanian
government asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to extend
for at least one more year the 1989-1999 economic restructuring
program co-sponsored by IMF and WB for the kingdom, in order to
enliven the economy.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Try German Firms for Exporting Weapons to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Wednesday to
put eight German companies on trial for exporting chemical
weapons to Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Director general of Iran's judiciary public relations office
Fotovat Nassiri Savadkouhi said that the German companies would
go on trial in Tehran public court, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Savadkouhi did not mention when the trial would start, but
stated the chemical weapons provided to Iraq by the German
companies caused 10,000 deaths and 50,000 injuries in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Because the crimes were committed in the territory under the
jurisdiction of Iranian judiciary, he said, according to the
international judicial laws, the cases can be taken up in the
Iranian courts.
</P>
<P>
Savadkouhi said so far 600 cases against the German firms have
been submitted to the court and the plaintiffs have asked for
compensation for damages ranging from 500,000 to 1,000,000 German
marks (278,000 to 555,500 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Iranian judicial official said that the eight German
companies provided the Iraqi government with basic material for
production of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
He named the video-taped confessions of the captured Iraqi
commanders as evidence to confirm the German companies'
involvement in Iraq's chemical weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Various U.N. special commission reports, researches carried out
by Iran's defense and judiciary's civil departments and witnesses'
reports constitute more evidence in the case, he added.

KATHMANDU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Children aged below 14 and
old people aged above 60 account for 41.27 percent and 5.49
percent respectively of the total population of 21.84 million in
Nepal, figures show.
</P>
<P>
Youth aged between 15 and 24 account for 19.15 percent of the
total population, according to figures available at a press
conference held here Wednesday for the United Nations Population
Fund to release the State of World Population 1998.
</P>
<P>
The male population and female population in Nepal stands
respectively at 10.903 million and 10.939 million, of which women
aged 15-49 account for 47.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total fertility rate for Nepalese women is 4.43 while child
mortality rate and infant mortality rate in the country were
43/1,000 and 79/1,000 respectively in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Birth not attended by health professionals is as high as 89.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, the adult literacy ratio in 1996 was 36.72 with those
for male and female at 54.32 and 21.33 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mean age at first marriage here is 17.1.
</P>
<P>
Population density in the Himalayan kingdom is 148.41 per
square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the world population report, Henning Karcher,
resident coordinator of the U.N. System's Operational Activities
for Development in Nepal, said that population is growing at an
alarming rate in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the Nepal Human Development Report
1998, population in Nepal doubled between 1961 and 1991, and at
the current growth rate of 2.5 percent, it is expected to reach
the 40 million mark by 2025.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed a great challenge," he observed. "Not only does
the size of the population pose a serious threat to an already
impoverished state, but an ever-increasing proportion of over-65
population is likely to be a major issue in Nepal, especially in
the context of the virtual absence of satisfactory social security
systems and safety nets."

The DPRK reportedly fired a newly developed, two-stage

</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told the House of

missile firing was not only a serious threat to Japan's security,
but also a grave matter for the security, peace and stability in
Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK statement said, "It is imprudent for Japan to say this
or that, unaware of what the DPRK did, a missile test or anything
else."
</P>
<P>
It ridiculed that Japan is "zealously developing long-distance
vehicles and other up-to-date weapons and paving the way for
overseas aggression."
</P>
<P>
"Many countries around Japan possess or have deployed
missile. Japanese politicians, however, hurl mud only at the DPRK
while being unaware of the background," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It asked Japan to pay for the 40 odd years of its occupation of
Korea and murder of Koreans and warned Japan to "face up to
reality, act with discretion and renounce its anachronistic
hostile policy toward the DPRK."

LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Triple-jump world record
holder Jonathan Edwards has admitted defeat in his battle to take
part in the World Cup in Johannesburg next week.
</P>
<P>
And he also decided not to compete again this season, after
failing to shake off an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
The Briton will lose more than 60,000 pounds (about 100,000
U.S.dollars) for missing Saturday's IAAF Grand Prix final in
Moscow on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the newly-crowned European champion, who pulled out of
last Friday's Brussels Golden League meeting when the pain in his
left ankle became unbearable, is determined to have immediate
surgery on the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The selectors were keen for me to jump as they felt it would
make a difference between a maximum eight points or possibly just
one," said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
"But I tried to train and I just couldn't put any weight on my
foot.
</P>
<P>
"I hoped I might get one more competition before the end of
the season. When I got back from Brussels, I felt slightly better.
</P>
<P>
"But this convinced me it is just not possible. It is just not
going to happen that I compete again this year."
</P>
<P>
His absence from Johannesburg follows the withdrawal of
European 200m gold medallist Doug Walker, 400m hopeful Mark
Richardson and 1500m runner John Mayock.

Edwards has been replaced in the World Cup squad by reigning
Commonwealth champion Julian Golley.

The move is in line with a World Bank decision to increase the
proportion of credit facilities to Lebanon's private sector from
1.5 percent to 3 percent of the loan budget.
</P>
<P>
So far, the IFC has granted the private sector 442 million
U.S. dollars in short and medium-term loans, creating over 6,000
jobs in Lebanon.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday proposed a freeze
in wage rises for top government officials.
</P>
<P>
He planned to set a example by forfeiting his upcoming monthly
pay rise of about 1,500 Shekels (about 410 U.S. dollars), and
urged teachers, the Labor Federation and other unions to follow
suit to try and maintain Israel as "an island of stability in the
heart of the international (economic) storm."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu said Tuesday that he regards the burgeoning
Turkish-Israeli military relationship as the basis for a regional
defense structure.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Egypt and Greece are all very sensitive to the subject
of the Turkish-Israeli military relationship, which has been
encouraged by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Schools were expected to remain closed Wednesday morning
and the Labor Federation is likely to shut down most public
services after their respective talks with the Treasury over wage
rises resulted in no progress.
</P>
<P>
It is easy for Netanyahu to call for a freeze in wage rises for
senior officials but very difficult to implement it.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Turns Away Foreign Workers for Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is curtailing jobs for
foreigners so as to see more locals employed, the semi-official
Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Regulations have been adopted to bar guest workers from filling
15 kinds of positions like accountancy, teaching and office work,
Minister of Labor Mohammad Mahdi Farhan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the ministry has recently requested hotels and
other tourism businesses to refrain from employing non-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, job opportunities will be added for Jordanians in
the sectors that deny jobs to quest workers, especially tourism,
Farhan said.
</P>
<P>
By barring non-Jordanians from more occupations, the ministry
intends to make job vacancy and help the unemployed Jordanians
hired, he added.
</P>
<P>
Officials put the unemployment in locals at 100,000, but
independent sources placed it as high as 1.2 million, or 26
percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
There are now 600,000 non-Jordanians working in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Non-Jordanians find jobs more easily than Jordanians as they
get lower wages and ask no health insurance from employers.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Demands Better Investment Structure in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has
suggested Jordan to adjust investment structure and speed up
privatization so as to revive its national economy, said a Jordan
Businessmen Association (JBA) statement obtained here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by John Page, the WB's chief economist
for the Middle East and North Africa Region, during a
JBA-sponsored meeting on Tuesday in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has to adjust the current investment
structure by directing the investors' priorities towards the
productive sector rather than building houses in order to create
"a balance between commercial and non-commercial investments,"
said Page.
</P>
<P>
A balanced investment structure, plus a healthy ratio of
investment to the gross domestic products (GDP), will contribute
much to reviving Jordan's economy, whose growth rates almost
grounded to zero in the past few years, said Page.
</P>
<P>
He added that Jordan's current ratio of investment to the GDP
stands at 23 to 24 percent, which is "satisfactory" in accordance
with regional standards.
</P>
<P>
The present investment structure in Jordan is not reasonable,
as most investors focus on house-building projects instead of
productive industrial ones due to a natural fear that any
investment in industry might be ruined as a result of the
unstable regional circumstance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Page said, the Jordanian government needs to speed
up its privatization program in conjunction with the adjustment of
investment structure to revive the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan needs to privatize its institutions, which will make
private sector investment more profitable" through fully
implementing the privatization program launched in early 1990s,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be beneficial to the government to give the private
sector the opportunity to play "a major role" in the economy,
said Page.
</P>
<P>
Page paid his visit to Jordan, at a time when the Jordanian
government asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to extend
for at least one more year the 1989-1999 economic restructuring
program co-sponsored by IMF and WB for the kingdom, in order to
enliven the economy.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Try German Firms for Exporting Weapons to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Wednesday to
put eight German companies on trial for exporting chemical
weapons to Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Director general of Iran's judiciary public relations office
Fotovat Nassiri Savadkouhi said that the German companies would
go on trial in Tehran public court, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Savadkouhi did not mention when the trial would start, but
stated the chemical weapons provided to Iraq by the German
companies caused 10,000 deaths and 50,000 injuries in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Because the crimes were committed in the territory under the
jurisdiction of Iranian judiciary, he said, according to the
international judicial laws, the cases can be taken up in the
Iranian courts.
</P>
<P>
Savadkouhi said so far 600 cases against the German firms have
been submitted to the court and the plaintiffs have asked for
compensation for damages ranging from 500,000 to 1,000,000 German
marks (278,000 to 555,500 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Iranian judicial official said that the eight German
companies provided the Iraqi government with basic material for
production of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
He named the video-taped confessions of the captured Iraqi
commanders as evidence to confirm the German companies'
involvement in Iraq's chemical weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Various U.N. special commission reports, researches carried out
by Iran's defense and judiciary's civil departments and witnesses'
reports constitute more evidence in the case, he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Unveils Measures to Revitalize Domestic Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday announced
a package of monetary and fiscal measures to revitalize its
rapidly cooling domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Those measures aim to keep the economy from slipping into
deeper recession, said Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Kyu-sung
</P>
<P>
The package includes taking a flexible approach toward money
supply, expanding credit guarantees for small- and medium-sized
enterprises, exporters and housing builders and increasing
consumer financing instruments for buyers of houses and other
durable goods.
</P>
<P>
The package apparently came in response to a mounting fear that
the economy was plunging deeper due to austere measures imposed by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December when the
nation signed an agreement with it for a rescue loan of 58 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help stimulate the domestic demand, all fiscal
measures will be mobilized at the expense of budget deficits, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of financial sector restructuring will be
completed by the end of September to remove economic uncertainties
which is alleged putting immense pressures on consumer sentiment,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the slumping domestic demand to mass
layoffs and pay cuts.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the central Bank of Korea said the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) declined 6.6 percent in the second quarter
of this year, its worst performance in the past 18 years. The drop
followed a 3.9 percent contraction in the first quarter of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Influential Tycoon Predicts Yeltsin Ouster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- An influential Russian tycoon
said Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin would have to resign
if the country had no strong political power.
</P>
<P>
Boris Berezovsky told the local Ekho Moskvy radio that Yeltsin
would have to step down to "make space for strong power."
</P>
<P>
However, Berezovsky, who is also executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, said if strong power emerges
in Russia, Yeltsin may continue his presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Strong power will reconcile itself with the fact that the
president cannot be to a necessary extent involved in the
stormily developing events," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a poll taken over the weekend shows
that 36 percent Moscow residents supports the voluntary
resignation of Yeltsin, though 28 percent viewed such a turn of
events as dangerous.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of 936 Muscovites conducted by the
Public Opinion Fund on August 29-30, 56 percent of the respondents
support the idea of limiting the powers of the president.

<HEADLINE> Japan's New Party Sakigake to Be Virtually Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan's New Party Sakigake on
Wednesday announced that it will be virtually dissolved after the
current extraordinary Diet (parliament) session ends in early
October.
</P>
<P>
The party's leader, House of Representatives member Masayoshi
Takemura, and four other party members issued a statement at a
press conference, saying that the party will continue to legally
exist and simply be called "Sakigake."
</P>
<P>
Each party member will be free to join the renamed party, but
Takemura said only he and House of Councillors member Tenzo
Okumura will remain.
</P>
<P>
Three others of the party's five Diet members will become
independents.
</P>
<P>
Sakigake failed to gain a seat in the July 12 House of
Councillors (upper house) election, and many former Diet members,
fearing that they would not be able to win back their seats in the
next lower house election, called for the dissolution.
</P>
<P>
The New Party Sakigake was established in June 1993 by 10 Diet
members, mainly young former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
members, and had 27 Diet members in its heyday.
</P>
<P>
The party ended its four-year coalition with the ruling LDP
before the July upper house election.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Sets Up Crisis Center in Welfare Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
established a crisis center in the fields of people's welfare and
poverty eradication, an assistant to Coordinating Minister for
People's Welfare Sudjono told Antara News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The center was equipped with a computer network accessible from
every sub-district administration office in the country to keep
the public at large abreast of developments in both fields in
macro terms and about implementation of the government's social
welfare and poverty eradication programs.
</P>
<P>
He said that an important benefit of the system was that it
would enable the prevention of duplications or overlapping of
government activities in the distribution of basic necessaries,
scholarships and work capital among poor families.
</P>
<P>
Soedarmadi, secretary to the coordinating minister for people's
welfare and poverty eradication, told reporters that the number of
poor families in Indonesia had increased from 16.9 million in June
to 17.3 million in August this year.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, he said, the government had been subsidizing
a program to provide rice to 7.3 million poor families.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to fight poverty, the government had been
offering work capital assistance called Business Partnership
Development Credit of 50 million rupiah (5,000 U.S. dollars) at 12
percent interest per annum per package to poor families deemed
qualified to run a business in partnership with a cooperative or
medium-scale enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The government had set aside some 250 billion rupiah (25
million U.S. dollars) to back up the Business Partnership
Development Credit scheme nation-wide, but so far only 25 percent
of the amount had been spent for the purpose, he added.

LUANDA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Projects which have secured
financial back-ups should get priority in the action program of

</P>
<P>
Idalina Valente, Deputy Minister of Planning, said at a forum
on the revision of the SADC action program that projects which
are beneficiary to the regional economy should enjoy priority in
the regional group's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Valente said that SADC should reduce the number of projects in
the action program and develop projects that are feasible, adding
that she would take the stance to the SADC summit to be held in
Mauritius on September 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
SADC policy and programs should be balanced, mutual-beneficial
and conducive in conlidating trust among its member nations,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Its current action program, which covers about 400 projects
with an investment value at eight billion U.S. Dollars, were
passed on the Council of Ministers meetings in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 75 to 80 percent of the money for the projects are

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch met FIFA president Joseph Blatter for a working session
at the Olympic House in Lausanne, Switzerland, said an IOC press
release reaching here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The two world sports heads agreed on Monday evening to meet
regularly at presidential level and also expressed the wish to
strengthen contacts between the executive boards of their two
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The new FIFA president wants to see football given greater
prominence in the framework of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
For the 2000 Games in Sydney, all the arrangements have
already been made, but the file concerning the age limit on
players taking part (under 23) may be reopened.
</P>
<P>
At present, each team taking part in the Olympic men's
football tournament is allowed to include three players aged over
23, and this figure could be increased to five, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The fact remain that, to ensure that top players take part in
the Olympic football tournament, the competition dates are an
essential issue.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, for the Olympic Games in 2004, with a view to
improving the quality of play, among other things, there are
plans to increase the number of women's teams from eight to 12.
</P>
<P>
A study will be undertaken to examine how the Football
Arbitration Tribunal (TAF) could make use of the synergies of the
Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) while ensuring that the TAF
retains its independence.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of doping, FIFA supports the efforts of the
international sports community, and the IOC in particular, in
combating this scourge.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's External Debts Slightly Down in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's total external
debts stood at 152.2 billion U.S. dollars in July, down 1.52
billion dollars from the previous month, the Ministry of Finance
and Economy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the decline largely to net payments of
mid- and long-term debt by financial institutions, which amounted
to 1.8 billion dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
The long-term debt went down slightly, from 11.54 billion
dollars in June to 11.39 billion dollars in July, representing
74.8 percent of the total foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
However, short-term debt with maturities of less than one year
edged up from 38.31 billion dollars in June to 38.35 billion
dollars in July, accounting for 25.2 percent of the total foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debts, especially the short-term ones, were one of the
key factors that dragged South Korea into the financial crisis
late last year, forcing it to borrow 57 billion dollars from the
International Monetary Fund last December.

MACAO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Lai Ieng Kit formally resumed office
here on Wednesday as director of the Identification Department of the
Macao government, indicating that the localization of civil servants
has scored new progress in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Lai, 41, began to work in the department in 1987 and served as its

<P>
At the inaugural ceremony, the new director said that he would

and offering suggestions to the Macao SAR Preparatory Committee on the
definition of permanent Macao resident and permanent residence right,
he said.

as department director in the Macao government.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of medium- and high-level officials in the
Macao government increased markedly this year, only three out of 59

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Sees Summer Traffic Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Both passenger and cargo traffic in
the Macao International Airport during the summer traffic peak in July
and August set new records, according to a news release issued by the
airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 241,140 passengers used the airport in August, easily
beating July's record of 205,595 and bringing about an increase of 35
over August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Passenger traffic grew strong especially on the air routes leading
to Taiwan and the mainland areas of China, compensating for losses on
North and South East Asian routes as a result of the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In July and August, passenger traffic increased 27 percent over the
same period last year. And the airport handled 16,078 tons of cargo, a
sharp increase of 124 percent over that in last year.
</P>
<P>
There are 13 regular airlines linking Macao with 25 cities, 13 of
which are in the mainland of China. Since its opening on November 9,
1995, the airport has handled 4.75 million passengers and 110,370 tons
of cargo.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim was sacked with effect
from 5.30 p.m. Wednesday, the Prime Minister's Department
announced Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a short statement issued late Wednesday
evening that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the Supreme Head of State
or the King) has been informed of Anwar's removal from the
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Anwar has also been removed from all other
positions held by him in his capacity as deputy prime minister and
minister of finance.
</P>
<P>
The letter of his sacking was believed to have been delivered
to Anwar at his house by a top government official at about 7 p.m.

</P>
<P>
No immediate response could be obtained from Anwar who is also
deputy president of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO)

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Conclude Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia and
the United States concluded their second round of meeting
Wednesday in what was described as "a very friendly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Aside from reiteration of strong support from Washington,
U.S. President Bill Clinton didn't offer any specific financial or
economic assistance to Russia, which was grappling with a
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the West stands ready to provide financial help so
long as Russia stays on its chosen course embarked seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, for his part, said his nation
has "a lot of tears and sweat" to expend on its struggle forward.
</P>
<P>
"There still is a lot of tears and sweat to spend before we
identify the forms of business cooperation which are worthy of the
two great nations," Yeltsin told a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, the two presidents signed two security
agreements. One commits each country to ridding itself of 50 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear warheads. The other
calls for sharing information on missile launch warnings.
</P>
<P>
They also signed joint statements on control of biological
weapons and on the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
While asserting "there were no differences" at the bilateral
front, Yeltsin blasted the use of force by Washington in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Russia rejects in principle the use of force," Yeltsin
said. "There can be no military solutions to today's
conflicts. Whether it's Kosovo, the situation over Iraq,
Afghanistan or others."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. bombing of the suspected terrorist sites
in Afghanistan and Sudan in August, Yeltsin said he was "outraged"
by the U.S. decision.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated his opposition to what he called "NATO
centrism," or the central military role the U.S.-led North
Atlantic Treaty Organization plays in Europe and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived here Tuesday morning, came at a
difficult time for Russia, which is confronting a full-blown
financial crisis and without a fully functioning government.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, on Monday
overwhelmingly rejected Yeltsin's nominee for premiership, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, in the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has renominated Chernomyrdin, but the
opposition-dominated Duma will most likely shoot down the
nomination in the second round of balloting scheduled for Friday,
prolonging the country's political stand-off.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was appointed acting prime minister August 24
when Yeltsin abruptly fired the four-month-old cabinet of Sergei
Kiriyenko, after an effective devaluation of the ruble and a de
facto default on Russia's foreign debts sent prices rocketing and
securities diving to record lows.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, Clinton was scheduled to meet with other major
political players, including speakers of both houses of
parliament, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Krasnoyarsk region governor
Alexander Lebed, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, Our Home is
Russia leader Alexander Shokin and Grigory Yavlinsky of Yabolo.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton and Yeltsin held their second round of talks at the
Kremlin, Communist leader Zyuganov bluntly summed up the high
stakes in this country's internal power struggle: "President
Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war."
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the Duma blocks the
premier's nomination three times, the president will have to
select a new nominee or dissolve the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has insisted he would not give up on democratic
reforms or on his appointment of Victor Chernomyrdin to return as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The past two years in Russia's life have been full of stormy
political events, great laborious work on reforming the economy,"
Yeltsin said in dinner remarks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Soon there were disappointments, too, and unfulfilled
hopes. But we've never lost the conviction in the necessity of
the transformations we're carrying out."

<HEADLINE> Hosts Field Best Paddlers in Chinese GP, World Top Two Skip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Wang Zijiang
</P>
<P>
JI'NAN, Shandong Province, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Olympic
champion Liu Guoliang and former world champion Kong Linghui will
anchor the Chinese team in the China Grand Prix table tennis
tournament to be started here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, world top two players, Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus
and Zoran Primorac of Croatia, will be absent from the four-day
meet.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu, who finished 1-2 in the men's singles and paired
up to win the doubles at the Australian Open last week, are
favored to lift the two titles again in the tournament which was
inaugurated in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Grand Prix has always been regarded as a home show
for the hosts paddlers rather than an international tourney
because only three titles were won by non-Chinese players since
1992.
</P>
<P>
World number five Liu, who shot to fame in the 1992 edition
after stunning all-time great Jan-ove Waldner of Sweden, was
expected to display brilliant performance in his favorite
tournament, which features men's and women's singles and doubles
events.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the world's only male player who has won a grand slam
of the Olympic, World Cup and World Championships titles, did not
enter the tournament after flopping to world No. 40 Peter Fraz of
Germany in the second round of the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Grand Prix has always been Waldner's Waterloo. The
32-year-old Swede played twice in 1992 and 1993, but was
eliminated twice by unknown Chinese youngesters at the early
stages -- the first time losing to Liu and the second to Feng Zhe.
</P>
<P>
Representing Sweden this time are veterans Jorgen Persson,
Peter Karlsson and Fredrik Hakansson.
</P>
<P>
Persson, a main force of the Sweden's winning team in three
successive World Championships from 1989 to 1993 and world
singles champion in 1991, did not want to reveal why his
long-time teammate Waldner failed to play the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
"We come here directly from Australia," Persson said, "I don't
know why he has hasn't come."
</P>
<P>
Biro Cheav, head coach of France, said Waldner might have
flown home to ready himself for the European Masters
Championships in Germany next month since there is little hope to
overcome the Chinese players.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of Samsonov, defending champion Primorac and
Waldner, the 1995 world champion Jean-Phillippe Gatien was
expected to pose the Chinese the toughest tests though his coach
Cheav maintained a low profile.
</P>
<P>
"He is too old and has injuries around," Cheav said, "To reach
semifinals is not bad."
</P>
<P>
With three months to go before the 13th Asian Games in
Bangkok, Thailand, both China and its traditional Asian rival
South
Korea take this gathering as a warm-up for the more important
quadrennial Asian Games slated for December this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian Games is the most important for all of us," said
South Korea's head coach Lee Sang Kook, "The Chinese Grand Prix
is just a training ground for us. And I hope Kim Taek Soo will
reach the final."
</P>
<P>
The world No. 11 Kim, a lost finalist at the Australian Open
to Chinese Kong, said he was no match with the strong Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"Kong has made a great improvement since last year," Kim said,
"His backhand, speed, topspin, all have been improved. He has a
better chance if we meet again in the final. And China has a lot
of promising young stars, so the gap between us is getting wider
and wider."
</P>
<P>
The women's competition will undoutedly be China's dominance
since the Chinese women have never let a single major
international title slip off their hands in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The hosts will field all its best female players for the
tournament, also a major warm-up for the 45th World Championships
in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, from April 26 to May 9, 1999. They
include world No. 2 Li Ju, No. 3 Wang Nan and No. 4 Wang Chen.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, who has been world No. 1 for six years, will not
play as she is studying in Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
The 61,000 US dollars event, to run until Sunday, has
attracted 140 players from 25 countries and regions, all of them
inside the 100 rankings.
</P>
<P>
Winner of the men's singles event will get a prize money of
10,000 while the woman champion takes 8,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met here today with a Lions Clubs International
(LCI) delegation led by Kajit Habanananda, LCI's president.
</P>
<P>
This charitable organization donated 15 million U.S. dollars to
China last year for Sightfirst China Action, the world's largest
joint program to combat blindness. The purpose of the program is
to finance 1.75 million cataract-removal operations,
organize 250 medical teams for remote and poor areas, and
recruit 11,000 eye doctors for hospitals at the county level in
China between 1997 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, who is also honorary president of the the Chinese
Association for the Disabled (CAD), extended his personal
congratulations to Habanananda, LCI's first Asian president, and
expressed gratitude for LCI's support and assistance to disabled
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the two sides will ensure the success of
Sightfirst China Action by joint efforts and further cooperation
with other departments, with the program as a starting point.
</P>
<P>
Habanananda told Li that LCI has already formed good ties with
CAD and China's Ministry of Health. LCI has successfully carried
out operation Sightfirst China Action and is willing to establish
long-term partnerships with other departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, LCI District 303 of Hong Kong and Macao
donated 250,000 U.S. dollars to China's flood-stricken areas for
post-flood reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Habanananda and his party are visiting China at the invitation
of both the Ministry of Health and CAD to inspect the progress of

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Files Formal Request to WTO on EC's Anti- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
filed a formal request with the World Trade Organization (WTO) for
consultation on anti-dumping duties imposed by the European
Commission (EC) on imports of unbleached cotton, the official
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Pakistan has filed the request about 10 days back, it
will take not less than 60 days for the WTO to arrange a
consultation of the counterparts in Geneva, textile industry
sources were quoted as saying by APP.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO will set up a panel of dispute settlement body if
talks fail," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The EC had imposed definitive duties last month on unbleached
cotton fabric (grey cloth) of Pakistan, Indonesia, India, Egypt
and China. Duties imposed on Pakistan are lowest (9.5 percent) as
compared to other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the textile industry sources, Pakistan's annual
exports of bleached, un-bleached and semi-bleached cotton fabrics
amount to 106 million U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
These definitive anti-dumping duties could be a permanent
feature if approved by the EC's Advisory Council which will hold a
meeting in this regard shortly in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had initially entered into a price undertaking
discussion with the EC. However, not having been able to arrive at
a satisfactory arrangement, Pakistan discontinued these discussion
like India.
</P>
<P>
"On the advice of Ministry of Commerce, the discussions were
dropped by All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA)," the
industry sources added.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive APMTA, Khalid Amin said Wednesday, Pakistan had
options to plead the case of anti-dumping duties jointly with
India, but Pakistan opted to fight the case alone.
</P>
<P>
He said that in any case, Pakistan's textile industry has to
face stiff competition in Europe which is the largest consumer of
textile product of the world.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has negligible textile exports to Europe currently as
compared to other countries of the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> HKU Professor Encourages Students To Be Optimistic Before Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Professor Y.C. Cheng,
vice-chancellor of the Hong Kong University (HKU), here Wednesday
encouraged his students to remain optimistic in the face of Asia's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during his welcoming address to new students, Cheng
stressed: "My message to you is -- and I hope you will take my
words to heart -- do not feel pessimistic or disheartened."
</P>
<P>
He called on the students to Look on the positive side. "While
all seems to be doom and gloom at the moment we can take heart
from the knowledge that this is only a temporary setback for us
and our city," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that Hong Kong has weathered many storms in the past
and it can and will weather this one.
</P>
<P>
"It is through suffering that individual human beings become
better and stronger; so it is with our city," he added.
</P>
<P>
Explaining reasons for his confidence, Cheng said that he based
his confidence in the future on two undeniable assets which will
help Hong Kong through our present crisis -- Hong Kong's special
relationship with China's mainland and Hong Kong's advantage of
human resources.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is not only part of China, it is also the gateway to
this prospering hinterland, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
"We will take full advantage of this, making full use of
China's resources and striving to be of service to the mainland,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's greatest resource is its people, Cheng said. "This
human capital -- if developed and nurtured carefully and with
vision -- will be a sure source of our resurgence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cheng encouraged the students to make full use of their time in
 the HKU as the university has reformed the curriculum this
year. The new curriculum is more flexible and broadened and will
help students prepare for flexibility and adaptation in later
life.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Advertising Exhibition Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- MarComAsia'98, an exhibition
 reflecting the achievements of the developing media and promoting
 the exchange of ideas on advertising, opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the region's first multi-faceted event organized by the
 Hong Kong Trade Development council for the dynamic industries of
 advertising, marketing and communications.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 exhibitors from the region including about 60
from the Chinese mainland such as the Xinhua News Agency and the
China Central Television (CCTV) as well as national or regional
newspapers, magazines, radios and television stations participated
 in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the exhibition, Michael
Sze, executive director of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council, said that one of the main features of MarComAsia'98 will
be the China Media Pavilion organized by Wen Wei Po, a major
Chinese language newspaper in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the fair is the MarComAsia'98 conference
where industry experts will share their views on the industry
trends, challenges and opportunities in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Philip Wong, vice-chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce, noted that advertising is one of the fastest-growing
service industries in Hong Kong, with expenditures increasing in
1997 by 20 percent to more than 20.4 billion HK dollars (2.61
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also ranks the third in the world in terms of per
capita advertising expenditures and provides professional
advertising services and marketing support to the entire
Asia-Pacific, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there are two great trends occurring right now that
define the advertising and marketing industry in the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The first is the economic downturn affecting the region. The
second is the great opportunity represented by the Chinese market,
 he said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money spent on advertising last year in the
Chinese mainland soared by 53 percent to more than 30.5 billion
RMB (3.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wong quoted analysts as predicting that the mainland will
become the world's fourth largest advertising market in terms of
revenue by as early as 2003.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, Zhang Guoliang, leader of the
Xinhua News Agency delegation and Editor-in-Chief of the Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch, told local reporters: "This is our
largest exhibition in Hong Kong, which fully shows that the Xinhua
 News Agency attaches great importance to the MarComAsia'98."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said Xinhua releases various new stories and economic
information to China and other parts of the world around the clock
 everyday in seven languages in addition to more than 100 photo
negatives, totaling more than 1.5 million words. It also edits and
 publishes some 40 kinds of newspapers and periodicals.
</P>
<P>
"Our specially designed pavilion will give visitors an overall
image of Xinhua's development and reform for many years,
especially after China implemented the policy of reform and
opening to the outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tan Xisong, director of Advertisement Economy and Information
Programs Center of the CCTV, said that she was very glad to note
that the opening of the exhibition coincided with the 40th
anniversary of the founding of the CCTV.
</P>
<P>
Through the exhibition, the CCTV will brief overseas audiences
on its eight channels, broadcasting 138 hours of programs daily
and on its advertising operation as well.
</P>
<P>
Many local exhibitors expressed the belief that the exhibition
will provide them a unique opportunity to meet their strategic
partners in expanding their business.
</P>
<P>
A conference and a seminar will also be held during the
three-day exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Taiwan Investment Not Affected: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- An article in the September
issue of "Relations Across the Taiwan Straits" magazine says that
criminal deeds perpetrated by a small number of Taiwanese
businessmen will not affect the policy adopted by the Chinese
mainland to protect the legal rights and interests of the Taiwan
residents.
</P>
<P>
The article titled "Punish Taiwan Espionage Activities and
Protect Taiwan Investment" says that all sorts of unwise
commentaries and rumors involving the recent Taiwanese espionage
case should be put to a final end.
</P>
<P>
On August 13, 1998, the Beijing Municipal No.1 Intermediate
People's Court made a ruling of first instance in the case of four
Taiwanese who were found to be working for the Taiwan Military
Intelligence Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court Tuesday made the
decision to uphold the original judgement on the four Taiwanese
charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
Kou Jianming was sentenced to four years imprisonment and
deprived of political rights for two years. The other three --
Chen Shaoyu, Han Yueting and Zhou Changming -- were also
identified as having engaged in the crime of espionage, but were
exempted from criminal punishment because they had performed
meritorious deeds.
</P>
<P>
The four frequently came to the Chinese mainland between June
1993 and March 1998, under the cover of the China Cross-Strait
Non-Governmental Exchange Association (CANEA), but they were
actually sent by Taiwan military intelligence Bureau to collect
political, economic, and military information.
</P>
<P>
These criminal activities were backed up by strong evidence and
were confessed to by the four themselves, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Although they called themselves businessmen, they were spies in
disguise. The third article of the Law on protecting investments
of Taiwan compatriots stipulates clearly that China must protect
Taiwan compatriots' investments in accordance with the law.

At the same time, Taiwan compatriots must make investments in

<P>
People will be able to judge the case fairly if they
comprehensively and accurately understand these two-tiered

find an overly political meaning in this case, or mount pressure

<HEADLINE> Fairly Strong Earthquake Hits Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A fairly strong earthquake with
a magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter Scale rocked the southern
Philippine island of Mindanao late Wednesday afternoon, the
seismology authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake, which struck at 4:38 p.m. local
time, was shallow under the sea, 140 kilometers southeast of Mati
city, Davao Oriental province, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology said in a bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The institute said it was not expecting any damage caused by
the tremor which was of tectonic origin. But it said some
aftershocks may follow.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports on damages, casualties or tsunami
resulting from the movement, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was the second to hit the Philippines within two
days.
</P>
<P>
A moderate quake measuring 4.3 on the Richter Scale shook Metro
Manila and its nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is located at what is known as the Pacific
"Ring of Fire" where powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
are common.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Taiwan Investment not Affected: Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article noted that developing economic and trade relations
across the straits and encouraging investment from Taiwan is a
consistent policy of the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this policy, the Chinese mainland has always
made efforts to improve the investment environment and protect
Taiwan businessmen's legitimate rights and interests according to
related regulations and laws.
</P>
<P>
There are some in Taiwan who take economic and trade activities
across the straits as bargaining chips in political lawsuits, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, however, many Taiwan businessmen expressed their
confidence in mainland investment immediately after this case came
to their attention, it added.
</P>
<P>
Many businessmen also hope that Taiwan authorities give up
making use of so-called Taiwan businessmen to collect
intelligence, so as to retain the good reputations of legitimate
Taiwan businessmen, the article says.
</P>
<P>
According to related laws, the hearing of espionage cases,
unlike criminal cases, is not open to the public because these
cases involve state secrets, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
But taking people's concerns into consideration, some
authoritative departments publish accounts of these cases in a
timely fashion within the limits of the law, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article says that court-appointed lawyers entered pleas for
the accused, and helped contact their families to inform them of
the case and the situation of the accused after the Beijing
Municipal No. 1 Intermediate People's Court made its ruling of
first instance.
</P>
<P>
The article concludes that the proper rights and interests of
the four accused were fullly protected during the entire
litigation procedure.
</P>
<P>
The view of some in Taiwan that "the legal justice of all
procedure is suspected" shows a lack of basic legal knowledge and
basic facts, the article emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
The article calls for a clear awareness on the part of the
Taiwan people that espionage activities directed by the Taiwan
Military Intelligence Bureau indicate that the actions of the
Taiwan authorities are not in keeping with its promises.

MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia and
the United States concluded their second round of meeting
Wednesday in what was described as "a very friendly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Aside from reiteration of strong support from Washington,
U.S. President Bill Clinton didn't offer any specific financial
or economic assistance to Russia, which was grappling with a
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the West stands ready to provide financial help so long
as Russia stays on its chosen course embarked seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, for his part, said his nation
has "a lot of tears and sweat" to expend on its struggle forward.
</P>
<P>
"There still is a lot of tears and sweat to spend before we
identify the forms of business cooperation which are worthy of the
two great nations," Yeltsin told a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, the two presidents signed two security
agreements. One commits each country to ridding itself of 50 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear warheads. The other
calls for sharing information on missile launch warnings.
</P>
<P>
They also signed joint statements on control of biological
weapons and on the situation in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> State of World Population 1998 Released in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- It will be a serious
challenge
to meet the increasing needs of both the young and the elderly in
the coming decades, the State of World Population 1998 released
here Wednesday cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the United Nations Population Fund
under the theme of "the new generations."
</P>
<P>
It said that over one billion people aged between 15 and 24 are
entering their childbearing and working years, and at the same
time, the number and proportions of people aged above 65 are
increasing at an unprecedented rate.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of young and old "new generations" is
challenging societies' ability to provide education and health
care for the young, and social, medical and financial support for
the elderly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that today's largest-ever young generation will swell
the working-age population in many countries over the next two
decades. And if they find productive work, there will be a
one-time demographic bonus for development.
</P>
<P>
However, more than one billion jobs will need to be created to
accommodate these new workers and reduce unemployment, which
cannot be achieved without lowering birth rates and expanding
education programs, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the elderly, it projected that in the next 50
years, the proportion of people over age 65 will more than double,
which will severely test the ability of families and society to
provide with them the financial, medical and social support.
</P>
<P>
And even worse, there will be fewer children to support the
elderly parents in the next generation, calling for more formal
and informal support systems for the elderly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It stated that thanks to unprecedented efforts over the last 30
years, the momentum of population growth has slowed, is slowing
and could slow still further in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the world population is still growing at
over 80 million a year, and will continue to grow at or near this
level for the next decade, so the population will only gradually
fall from this level, the report observed.
</P>
<P>
It said that the world population, 3 billion in 1960 and 5
billion in 1987, will pass 6 billion in mid-1999 and most likely
9.4 billion by 2050.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions lie in raising the age at first pregnancy and in
limitation of family size by enabling couples and individuals to
choose the size and spacing of their families," noted Henning
Karcher, resident coordinator of the U.N. System's Operational
Activities for Development in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Women are having half as many children as their mothers'
generation, because they have more choices in education, marriage
and employment as well as in family size and spacing.
</P>
<P>
Extending these choices to all women will further slow them
momentum of population growth, the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the report at a press conference, Karcher said,
according to the Nepal Human Development Report 1998, population
in Nepal, which stands at 21.8 million, doubled between 1961 and
1991, and at the current growth rate of 2.5 percent, it is
expected to reach the 40 million mark by 2025.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed a great challenge," he said. "Not only does the
size of the population pose a serious threat to already
impoverished state, but an ever-increasing proportion of over-65
population is likely to be a major issue in Nepal, especially in
the context of the virtual absence of satisfactory social security
systems and safety nets."

<HEADLINE> Japan Considers New Security Steps After DPRK Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan has begun to consider
taking new security measures after the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) test fired a ballistic missile on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told the House of
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday Pyongyang's
missile firing was not only a serious threat to Japan's security,
but also a grave matter for the security, peace and stability in
Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK reportedly fired a newly developed, two-stage
ballistic missile on Monday that overflew northeastern Japan and
fell into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
As measures to defend Japan from a possible missile attack,
Komura said he thinks "it is worth considering the promotion" of a
U.S.-proposed air defense system against ballistic missiles, known
as the theater missile defense (TMD) system.
</P>
<P>
Komura stressed Japan will take concerted steps with South
Korea and the United States to deal with the DPRK's development of
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
"I want to deal with the problem in a way of letting Pyongyang
know it would not make any gains from the missile firing, but
rather it would suffer by conducting an internationally
unforgivable act," Komura said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka
told a news briefing that Japan is considering introducing an
intelligence satellite to cope swiftly and appropriately with a
"crisis" such as Monday's missile incident.
</P>
<P>
He said the incident showed Japan cannot get a grasp of
up-to-the-minute information over its territory through its own
satellites.
</P>
<P>
Calling an intelligence satellite "indispensable in view of
Japan's security," the top government spokesman said the
government would seek intense discussion on the issue and
conclusion on ways to get a satellite capable of transmitting
images to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Up in Crisis-Hit Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Inflation has been on the rise
in Asian countries hard hit by the regional financial crisis,
South Asia Monitor and China and North Asia Monitor said in a
report available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have monitored the overall inflation of Asian
countries -- Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Singapore, South Korea and Japan since the crisis erupted in July
last year, and will continue to do so through the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said Indonesia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) will hit
the highest record of 23.4 percent in the region, followed by
Thailand where the CPI will rise to 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the Philippines will stay at the same rate of 8
percent, while the Philippines has changed the base year to
calculate CPI from 1988 to 1994 in order to cope with real costs.
</P>
<P>
Japan will be the best of all with a CPI of 0.7 percent. The
CPI of Singapore and Malaysia will be better than other members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN), at 3.5
percent and 3.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The float of the Thai baht on July 2, 1997 and its subsequent
depreciation triggered a regional financial crisis which rocketed
the inflation rate in the countries concerned from levels seen in
the first half of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian giant Lion Group
will continue to be actively involved in China's telecommunications
industry, Tan Sri William Cheng Psm, the Group's president, said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The president was in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province, to
attend the inauguration ceremony for a new digital mobile
telecommunications network jointly built by his company and China
Unicom.
</P>
<P>
As one of the three cooperative projects between the Lion Group

phone lines in Shaanxi and Guizhou provinces, and will open more
in Henan Province before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Lion Group, which began cooperation with China Unicom in
1995, has invested 65 million U.S. dollars in the project.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1994, China Unicom has introduced overseas capital
and technology from over 40 multinational groups to help sharpen
its competitive edge in the market.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Lion Group has invested 800 million U.S. dollars
in China in motor vehicles, food, medicine, real estate, and

Following an overnight rally on Wall Street, the market opened
strongly with the key index gaining 317.63 points, or 4.5 percent,

</P>
<P>
The gains were made as the Hong Kong government signaled its
continued determination to clamp down on speculators.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong said in a statement that it had
temporarily suspended the short-selling of three blue-chip shares
-- HSBC Holdings Plc., Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. and China
Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd. with effect from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange said: "The decision was taken after
settlement failures were reported by the Hong Kong Securities
Clearing Company on August 31 and September 1 for some
transactions in the three securities conducted on August 27 and
28."
</P>
<P>
The transactions had failed to meet the T+2 settlement
requirements "mainly due to the heavy selling on August 27 and
28," said the exchange.
</P>
<P>
As of September 1 unsettled short transactions involving the
three securities totaled 7.5 billion HK dollars (962 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain a fair and orderly market and manage the
settlement risk, the suspension will remain in force until
settlement backlogs of these shares are cleared, said the Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Banks' Bad Loans Rise to 8.3 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The bad loans held by South
Korea's 22 banks totaled 10.8 trillion won (some 8.3 billion
U.S. dollars ) in June this year, up 21 percent from the 8.9
trillion won registered in 1997, the Banking Supervisory Authority
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of bad loans rose from the 2.5 percent of the
total credit registered at the end of 1997 to 3.2 percent at the
end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
A key reason behind the rise of banks' bad loans was a series
of corporate bankruptcies, involving 55 companies which faced exit
orders from the Financial Supervisory Commission in the second
quarter, a spokesman for the authority said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, non-performing loans, which add substandard loans to
bad loans, came to 29 trillion won in June, up 36.4 percent from
the 21.3 trillion won of last year.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of non-performing loans also snowballed from 5.8
percent of the total credit marked in 1997 to 8.6 percent in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total bad loans, 14 commercial banks accounted for
8.6 trillion won in June, up from last year's 7.1 trillion won
while bad loans held by eight provincial-based banks went up from
1.8 trillion won to 2.2 trillion won.
</P>
<P>
Korea First Bank topped the list of bad loans with 1.5 trillion
won at the end of June, followed by Cho Hung Bank with 1.4
trillion won, Seoul Bank one trillion won, Korea Exchange Bank
864.9 billion won, and Hanil Bank 819.2 billion won.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current financial crisis was caused by corporate
failures and bad loans of financial institutions late last year.

<HEADLINE> India to Become World's Most Populous Country in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- India, with a higher birth
rate, would overtake China as the most populous country in the
world by 2050, United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) said in its
latest report on the state of world population.
</P>
<P>
world population would pass 6 billion mark next year and its
size in the next decade would depend on the policies and efforts
of the developing countries like India, which contribute 90
percent of its current growth, UNPFA representative Wasim Zaman
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 million people are being added to the world population
each year and India contributes about one-fifth of the growth,
zaman said while releasing the World Population Report for the
year 1998.
</P>
<P>
With approximately 30 people born every minute and 43,000 each
day on an average, India's population of over 980 million is
projected to reach 1,264 million by the year 2016, thus surpassing
China's present population of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
With only 2.4 percent of the land area but 16 percent of the
population in the world, this mass of humanity in the South Asia
country has kept putting increasing pressure on its
infrastructure, economy, environment, education, primary health
care and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
India's population went up to 846 million in 1991 from 345
million at the time of independence in 1947 despite the fact that
the country formulated an official population policy as early as
in 1952.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of population, the UNFPA report said the world
will witness rapid growth of two generations -- of elderly persons
and young adolescents -- which will challenge societies' ability
to provide medical, social and financial care to them.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of the past 30 years, the report said,
the momentum of global population growth is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
But, it added, past high fertility rates have led to current
rapid increase in numbers, resulting in the largest ever
generation of young people in every continent except Europe,
totaling 1.05 billion between the ages of 15 and 24.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, older populations are expanding "at an
unprecedented rate" in both developed and developing countries due
to improved health care that has increased longevity.

<HEADLINE> 12th NAM Summit Opens in Durban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The 12th summit
of the Non-Aligned movement (NAM) opened here Wednesday morning
with 65 heads of state and government expected to focus their
attention on the economic and political issues facing them.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana, chairman of the last NAM
summit, declared the meeting open at the International Convention
Center in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed the progress that the movement had achieved in the
past three years since the last summit was held in Cartagena,
Colombia, and expressed the hope that new vigor would be put into
the movement and more greater achievements would be attained in
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana then handed over the NAM chairmanship to South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Address the opening ceremony, Mandela said development
and peace, which have been the central objectives of the movement
from its foundation, still remain its principal challenges.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the violence of war, whether in the Democratic
Republic of Congo or in Kosovo, and whether in Afghanistan or in
Sri Lanka, are destroying human life.
</P>
<P>
The critical question of nuclear disarmament must remain high
on the list of priorities of the movement and the NAM countries
will have to continue to address the issue to ensure actual
achievement in this regard, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
On the economic difficulties facing the developing nations,
Mandela said: " One of the most immediate challenges that face
the developed countries is the need to remove the burden of the
unbearable debt. Much has been said about this, what is needed
is action by the developed countries and their partners in the
South."
</P>
<P>
There are resources within the world economy which could and
should be mobilized to address the development of the poor of the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called on the counterparts in the North to recognize
the door of enormous economic possibilities open toward the
achievement of a shared prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He also called for an African Renaissance in which the
continent will overcome a devastating past and ensure that it
also becomes a continent of democracy and peace, respect for
human rights, development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenge the movement faces, is the obligation
to ensure that "the objective of the rebirth of the continent of
Africa should and must succeed", Mandela stressed.
</P>
<P>
The NAM, which emerged in the wake of the Cold War, was formed
in 1961 in Belgrade, capital of Yugoslavia, where its first
meeting was attended by representatives from 25 countries.
</P>
<P>
The movement which now has 113 member countries is the biggest
demonstration of unity of the world's nations and their on-going
struggle to restructure the world economy and assure their right
to social development.

<HEADLINE> UN Agencies to Discuss Natural Disaster Warning Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Decade
(1990-2000) for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) will hold an
international conference in Postdam, Germany, on September 7-11 on
early warning systems for the reduction of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
"The use of effective early warnings has enabled successful
evacuations of people from impending disasters in India, the
Philippines and Bangladesh among others," said the IDNDR in a
press release here Tuesday. "Timely action has saved thousands of
lives."
</P>
<P>
The participants at the Postdam meeting will discuss the latest
scientific and technical achievements and modeling scenarios, the
decision and formulation of warnings, and dissemination of data
and messages via communication systems.
</P>
<P>
They will also deliberate responses to such warnings and
related aspects of the early warning systems at different levels
of society.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants will be heads of a number of world
organizations and United Nations agencies on telecommunications,
weather, environment, development, agriculture and health.
</P>
<P>
Natural hazards such as tropical storms, earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions cannot be avoided but their negative effects on
vulnerable populations can be reduced by timely and effective
warning systems.
</P>
<P>
This requires that the potential risk of a hazardous phenomenon
and the vulnerability of the population involved is identified
accurately, and that the information is transmitted to the
individuals in sufficient time and clarity so that they can take
action.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the nature of the hazard, the location of
vulnerable people and assets, elements of warning systems may be
organized and implemented at local, national, regional or
international levels.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Postdam conference will be a critical
element in the concluding IDNDR recommendations, which will be
presented in the special session of the Economic and Social
Commission (ECOSOC) and at the IDNDR Program Forum, both scheduled
for July 1999 in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> American Fans Rush for "Titanic" Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Fans across the United
States lined early Tuesday morning to buy the two-tape set of
"Titanic," a film that won 11 Academy Awards, including best
picture.
</P>
<P>
Film industry analysts say that, with the release of video
tapes, there began a second wave of the "Titanic" craze.
</P>
<P>
Blockbuster Video, a chain of video shops, announced it had
pre-sold one million copies while Best Buy, a chain of stores that
also sell video tapes nationwide, said it sold 50,000 copies
during the first two hours of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Video Store Magazine, a trade publication, estimated Paramount
had shipped out 24 million "Titanic" video, beating the previous
leader, "Jurassic Park," which holds the record among live-action
videos at 17 million copies sold.
</P>
<P>
The frenzy to buy the tape, which many stores are selling it
for 20 U.S. dollar or less, has led industry analysts to predict
"Titanic" will easily become the biggest-selling live-action video
of all time.
</P>
<P>
"Titanic was well on its way toward becoming the
biggest-selling live-action video in Hollywood history," one
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The appeal of "Titanic" is so vast that, despite its impending
release on video, the film earned an additional 385,000
U.S. dollar at the box office over the weekend, becoming the first
film to take in more than 600 million U.S. dollar in North America
alone.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade cooperation

opposite Taiwan region has continued to grow steadily this year,
official figures have indicated.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen has approved 1,548 projects funded by investors from

projects totaled 3.22 billion U.S. dollars and 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The number of projects funded by companies from Taiwan and the
value of contracted Taiwan investment accounted for 35 percent
and 23 percent, respectively, of Xiamen's total.
</P>
<P>
Besides, enterprises funded by investors from Taiwan now
account for 45 percent of Xiamen's industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Taiwan mainly invest in industrial projects,
such as electronics, machinery, chemicals, light industry and
textiles and building materials, according to a city official.
</P>

He said that more than 80 percent of the production of the
enterprises is exported and 86 percent of the firms are profitable.

Over the years, trade between Xiamen and Taiwan has totaled
7.75 billion U.S. dollars, with imports from Taiwan hitting 7.05
billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge has defended his country's military presence in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the charges by Rwandan Foreign Minister
Anastase Gasana, who said the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) has no security role in Congo (K), Zambia's
independent paper The Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge was speaking on his arrival Tuesday in the South
African city of Durban to attend a ministerial meeting of the
Non-Aligned Movement which opened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Rwanda and Uganda must remove their forces from the
former Zaire and allow the Congolese people to find a peaceful
solution to their problems.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, along with Angola and Namibia, has sent troops to
help the embattled government of President Laurent Kabila quash a
rebellion which began exactly one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana criticized the SADC's
military presence in Congo at a news conference held earlier
Tuesday, saying the 14-member bloc does not understand the
situation in the Great Lakes area, which comprises Burundi,
Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Uganda, which claimed they have security
interests in eastern Congo, have denied Kabila's accusations that
they are supporting the Congo rebels who are attempting to oust
his 15-month government.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the U.N. called for an immediate cease-fire
and on all foreign forces to leave Congo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N Security Council urged a dialog to end the fighting in
the vast central African country and its transformation toward
democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> State Development Bank Issues First Bonds by Public Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank
(SDB) issued five billion yuan (604 million US dollars) in
one-year financial bonds today, the first batch of bonds the bank
has issued through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being distributed by the central bank to other banks
and postal savings institutions as in the past, the bonds this
time will first go to underwriters through public bidding, and the
commercial banks and insurance companies will then buy the bonds
from the underwriters.
</P>
<P>
With an annual interest rate of 5.19 percent, the bonds are
expected to be traded on the national interbank money market after
receiving approval from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
SDB president Chen Yuan said the central bank will continue to
issue bonds this way, while keeping the past practice of issuing
bonds through designated subscription.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's three policy banks, the SDB issues financial
bonds to raise funds for loans, which are mainly used to support
the nation's basic industries and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, the bank had raised 398.9 billion
yuan (48 billion US dollars) through issuing financial bonds,
accounting for more than 90 percent of the total funds. The
remainder comes from the government and overseas funding sources.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Plans First Railway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China has completed a study on
the feasibility of building the first railway line in Tibet, a
project which would make Tibet the last region in China to have a
railroad.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Railways said the
1,100-kilometer trans-Tibet railway line is expected to cost 13.92
billion yuan (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the Golmud-Lhasa railway will be the shortest channel
linking Beijing, Shanghai and central China.
</P>
<P>
The Golmud-Lhasa railway will link Golmud in Qinghai Province
with Lhasa, capital of Tibet. This route has been an important
byway between Tibet and inland areas for at least 1,200 years.
</P>
<P>
Railway builders here say that after many years of research
they have discovered ways to deal with such geographical
difficulties as frozen soil and high altitudes during construction
of the railway.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1984, China has built up a 815-kilometer railway
from Golmud to Xining, provincial capital of Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that at least 85 percent of the materials
transported to and from Tibet are conveyed via Golmud.

SHENZHEN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based Read Real
Estate Company has bought the exclusive marketing rights to the
refrigerant produced by multinational Greencool Group at a cost of
74 million yuan (about 8.915 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The real estate company will set up a joint venture in Shenzhen
with Greencool for the exclusive sales of the product in the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, according to a Read spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The price of the deal, struck at an auction in Shenzhen on
Tuesday, is said to be the highest ever for product marketing
rights in China.
</P>
<P>
Greencool, which is one of the world's largest refrigerant
producers, has two manufacturing enterprises in the world, one in
Britain and the other in Tianjin, each with an annual production
capacity of 30,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The environmentally friendly Greencool refrigerant was listed
by the State General Administration of Environmental Protection in
April as one of the best environmental protection technologies in
China. It is the only refrigerant on the list.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was chosen as a major marketing target because it is

<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Great Hural
(parliament) of Mongolia on Wednesday vetoed the nomination of
Renchinnyamin Amarjargal as the country's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural then asked the ruling coalition of the National
Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party to submit a new
premier nominee to the parliament in 14 days, according to the
parliamentary press office.
</P>
<P>
Amarjargal, 36, who was a member of the Great Hural and acting
minister of external relations, was nominated for the premiership
by the ruling union on August 28 in a letter to the president.
</P>
<P>
After accepting the nomination on August 31, President
Bagabandy submitted it to the Great Hural for approval, a
presidential spokesman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the president rejected five times the nomination of
Davaadorj Ganbold, who was chairman of the Standing Committee of
Economic Policy of the Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
President Bagabandy believed that Davaadorj was responsible
for the country's intensified banking crisis, which led to the
fall of the former cabinet in July.
</P>
<P>
Instead, President Bagabandy nominated Dogsomin Ganbold, a
member of the Great Hural and the Mongolian National Democratic
Party, for the post. But the ruling union did not agree with the
president's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The ex-government led by Prime Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj was
dismissed on July 24 as a result of its decision in May to merge
the state-owned Renovation Bank with the private Golomt Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolia's law, the ruling parties' parliamentary group
should discuss the prime minister nominee with the president, who
in turn submits the nomination to the Great Hural for approval.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday proposed a freeze
in wage rises for top government officials.
</P>
<P>
He planned to set a example by forfeiting his upcoming monthly
pay rise of about 1,500 Shekels (about 410 U.S. dollars), and
urged teachers, the Labor Federation and other unions to follow
suit to try and maintain Israel as "an island of stability in the
heart of the international (economic) storm."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu said Tuesday that he regards the burgeoning
Turkish-Israeli military relationship as the basis for a regional
defense structure.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Egypt and Greece are all very sensitive to the subject
of the Turkish-Israeli military relationship, which has been
encouraged by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Schools were expected to remain closed Wednesday morning
and the Labor Federation is likely to shut down most public
services after their respective talks with the Treasury over wage
rises resulted in no progress.
</P>
<P>
It is easy for Netanyahu to call for a freeze in wage rises for
senior officials but very difficult to implement it.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Universities Attract More Overseas Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 2 (Xinhua)-- The number of overseas
students studying at universities in Shanghai has increased year
by year since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,598 such students from 101 countries and regions such as
the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada, Poland, India, Argentina
and Cuba are currently studying in 22 local universities,
including Fudan University and Tongji University.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the overseas students specialize in the
Chinese language and traditional Chinese subjects such as
acupuncture, massage and architecture.
</P>
<P>
The universities have provided good study environments and
living conditions for the students. For example, the International
Culture Exchange College at Fudan University offers 10-odd majors
to the 730 students from 52 countries.
</P>
<P>
Many of the students have played important roles after
returning home. Last July, five Malaysian students earned bachelor
degrees from the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine University
and six months later opened four traditional Chinese medicine
clinics in their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
One education expert notes that Shanghai has a long history of
cultural and educational exchanges between East and West. He said
the city's status as the nation's economic, finance and trade
center has attracted an increasing number of overseas students in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Overseas students can easily find jobs in Shanghai's numerous
joint ventures and overseas-funded companies after graduation,
according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20,000 overseas students will have studied in
Shanghai by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> PLA Men in Inner Mongolia Return to Bases After Victory over Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,000 officers and
men of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) have returned to
their barracks after winning victory over the floods in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
However, the historic, devastating flooding which began in
early July has left 370,000 people homeless in the autonomous
region. Local governments are now organizing large-scale
rehabilitation efforts, with the priority of helping the flood
victims tide it over the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
Flooding along the Nenjiang River pushed more than 20 of its
tributaries to overflow at some 800 spots, affecting some six
million people, destroying nearly 500,000 room-units and damaging
370,000 others, leaving 354,000 head of livestock dead, and
inundating two million hectares of crops.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from the Beijing, Shenyang, and Inner Mongolia
military command areas and six helicopters were sent to combat the
flooding. The Inner Mongolia Military Command Area also aroused
1,530 militia companies to participate in the effort.
</P>
<P>
All the breaches and danger spots along the river now have been
properly dealt with, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Reporters Gather in Ningxia for Founding Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred Chinese and
overseas reporters have gathered in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
China's smallest autonomous region (province) as the 40th
anniversary of the Region's founding approaches.
</P>
<P>
Two reporters from Japan's Asahi and Yomiuri daily newspapers,
who visited Ningxia 10 years ago, said they seemed to come to a
totally unfamiliar place this time and that all the changes in the
region themselves are news stories.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Ningxia comprises only 66,400 square
kilometers. Half a century ago, the region only had 19 motor
vehicles, a power generator, a 100-line telephone exchange, and
one 714-kilometer long-distance telephone line.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, the region's gross domestic product reached 21 billion
yuan (about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars), hundreds of kilometers of
railroad lines have been built, the regional airport receives 40
flights each week, and there are 370,000 telephone subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Ma Qizhi, Chairman of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, said very
few overseas reporters came to his region decades ago because of
its backward economy and lack of communications.
</P>
<P>
With the stress of the economic construction in northwest China
in the past few years, the region has begun attracting more
overseas media attention.
</P>
<P>
Among the overseas reporters here are representatives from the
U.S. Wall Street Journal, the BBC and Japan's Tokyo Daily, all of
whom are interested in China's aid-the-poor operation in Ningxia's
southern mountainous areas, one of the poorest areas in China.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Datukabu Bakar A. Harmid, head of the
Malaysian National News Agency and Hussein Ismail, a reporter from
Egypt, both from Muslim countries, focus on the daily and
religious life of Muslims in the region.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 mosques have been built in this smallest of China's
autonomous regions, and on average there is one mosque for every
500 Muslims in the region.
</P>
<P>
Finish television and Hong Kong-based Asia TV are interested
in the region's desert control, a big problem for many countries.
</P>
<P>
A large delegation of 12 major Hong Kong newspapers and
television reporters will visit the region, and additional
correspondents from the United States, Britain, Germany and
Australia will cover the 40th founding anniversary celebrations in
Ningxia in late September.

<HEADLINE> Inflation, Bank Rates Lower in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Inflation eased and interest
rates dropped in Kenya in August, as the Shilling showed signs of
weakening during the week to September, according to the weekly
report by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
But the general and underlying rates of inflation eased
following the sustained slowdown in the expansion of money supply
and stability of the Shillings, coupled with improved supplies of
basic food items, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity in the domestic money market eased during the week
to September, following the reduction of commercial banks'
statutory cash ratio requirement.
</P>
<P>
The average interbank borrowing interest rates declined to
24.32 percent during the week to August 28, from 24.97 percent
the previous week, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling began to weaken against major trading currencies
during the week to September exchanging on average at 59.56
Shillings to the U.S. Dollar, and 98.65 Shillings to the Sterling
Pound, compared to 59.52 Shillings and 96.98 Shillings
respectively in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
In the equity market Tuesday, the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)
recorded heavy trading with a total of 513,350 shares changing
hands, at a value of 31.3 million Shillings, compared to 313,700
shares valued at 18 million Shillings Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of deals stood at 282 from 271, whereas the NSE
20-share index slipped by 7.16 points or 0.25 percent to close at
2,855.50.
</P>
<P>
In the bonds market, the CBK Treasury bond Issue 1/98 was
heavily traded, with bonds worth 112.8 million Shillings sold at
prices ranging between 102.4 percent and 102.9879 percent.

LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's population would
reach 108 million this year, and 180 million by the year 2017, if
the current 3.2 percent growth rate is unchecked, according to a
health official.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Tukur Mani, Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of
Health, made the statement at a symposium on "Day of Six Billion"
to round off the World Population Day celebration in Lagos, the
Daily Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's fertility rate of about six was relatively high
compared to what obtained in developed countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our population is a youthful one and the percentage of those
below age 15 is 48 percent with the resultant heavy dependency
ratio and its far-reaching consequences on available resources
and development efforts," Mani noted.
</P>
<P>
The official called for the education of the girl children and
the elimination of all forms of discrimination against them,
adding that one of the measures to eliminate harmful cultural
practice to girl children was the regular dissemination of
information through the mass media.
</P>
<P>
Mani appealed to Nigerians to have the number of children they
could cater for in relation to the provision of basic needs of
life in order to improve the quality of life.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Southern
California are busy calling fire departments for help to remove
snakes, spiders, rodents, coyotes and other animals driven into
their homes by wildfires and a brutal heat wave.
</P>
<P>
A college student in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles
Country, called for help when she came face-to-face with a
rattlesnake in her bathroom. Ventura County firefighters rushed in
and decapitated the snake with a shovel.
</P>
<P>
"We are averaging between two to eight calls a day for snakes,
usually in areas that interface with wildlands. There is
tarantulas around, too," fire spokeswoman Sandi Wells said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures have been around 40 centigrade degree during most
daytimes of this summer across the Southern California. Lightning
touched off dozens of wildfires in the region Monday night and
Tuesday morning, destroying nearly 30,000 acres of brush and
timber.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tibet Rebuilding National Highways after Flood Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- National highways which were
destroyed during the floods have been rebuilt in southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region and traffic has returned to normal,
according to regional officials.
</P>
<P>
The heavy flooding in Tibet this year has caused several routes
to be discontinued and destroyed several bridges. According to the
statistics of the Tibet Communications Bureau, the roads that were
destroyed by the flooding added up to 2,125 kilometers, one-tenth
of all Tibetan roads. And all the national highways and local
ones were damaged to some degree.
</P>
<P>
The traffic disruptions, which inconvenienced the Tibetan
people and hindered the flood fight, are expected to have a direct
effect on economic development in Tibet
</P>
<P>
Several Tibetan emergency groups made up of specialists in
the fields of water conservation and transportation patrolled the
main roads day and night to check conditions and speed up repairs.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region has put more than 13 million yuan
into rebuilding its highways; and nearly 100 dangerous sections
have been repaired.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, No.108 and No.109 national highways have returned to
normal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan Transportation Bureau reportedly raised another 5
million yuan to ensure the smooth transportation of the national
highways between Qinghai and Tibet, and Sichuan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
More heavy rain is predicted for September in Tibet, which
could cause more problems for local government.

<P>
SHENZHEN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Stock Exchange
suspended trading Tuesday in Jiangsu Sanshan Industry and Commerce
Co. Ltd. The company has been losing money for three consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
The move, the first suspension in the exchange's 10-year

</P>
<P>
The company, mainly involved in chemical fiber production,
incurred verified losses in 1995, 1996 and 1997. According to
relevant regulations of the exchange and the country, trading must
be suspended if a company suffers losses for three consecutive
years. Trading can be resumed once the company begins to make
profits.

<HEADLINE> Indian Missile Testing Provokes New Arms Race: Pak Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan warned on Wednesday
that India's development of short and medium range missiles would
"provoke a new arms race in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has repeatedly drawn international attention to the
security implications of the Indian missile program," a Foreign
Office spokesman said in a statement, referring to India's testing
of a surface-to-air missile on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to "persuade India to
refrain from provoking a new arms race in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The development and deployment by India of short and medium
range missiles directly affected regional security, which had
already been undermined by Indian nuclear tests and escalation in
Indian firing along the Line of Control in Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
India tested its surface-to-air missile for the second time
this year on Tuesday. The 650-kilogram "Akash" (sky) missile,
with a range of 25 kilometers, is capable of carrying a
50-kilogram payload.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Population Growth Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's population growth
rate, one of the highest in Africa in the late 1980s and early
1990s, has decreased dramatically and now is among the lowest in
the continent, a U.N. agency report said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 U.N. Population Fund report noted that this east
African country saw population growth levels fall to only 2.2
percent in 1995, thanks to a successful family life education
program.
</P>
<P>
This indicates a slowing down in Kenya's population which
currently stands at about 29 million. It also means that the
country is set to reach more than 50 million people by the year
2025, said the annual report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, this is a dramatic improvement on population reports
in the early 1990s which predicted that Kenya's population levels
could surpass 70 million after 2015.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the average life expectancy of Kenya men
will only reach 52 while Kenyan women can live until 55.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the low life expectancy levels in Kenya is
the crisis caused by AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China Looks to Deficit Policy to Stimulate Economy -1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xinhua Writer Xu Xingtang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China announced recently that
it will issue 100 billion yuan in long-term treasury bonds to
support infrastructure construction, indicating that China is
trying to stimulate the economy through debt and deficit policies.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be listed in the state budget in the next two
years, 50 billion yuan of which will be listed in this year's
budget, expanding this year's financial deficit from the original
46 billion yuan to 96 billion yuan, considerably exceeding the
debt and deficit ceilings ratified by the first plenary session of
the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists hold that under the present conditions of
deflation, increased net withdrawal of money from circulation, and
a serious insufficiency of capital for construction projects, it's
both necessary and feasible for the government to increase input
in infrastructure projects through deficit expenditures.
</P>
<P>
China has set this year's economic growth target at eight
percent, though in the first half of this year the growth rate was
only seven percent. With exports negatively impacted by the Asian
financial crisis, the government has defined increased investment
as a major contributor to reaching the goal of eight percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng said that increasing
fiscal expenditure not only can directly promote social demand,
but also can stimulate individual consumption and enterprise
investment through increased wages and profits, thereby indirectly
increasing social demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that when the economy is slowing down, the stimulating
effect of monetary policy is comparatively slow, while fiscal
policies can directly expand social demand and can quickly boost
up the economy.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen met today with a visiting government cultural delegation
from the Republic of Korea (ROK) led by Culture and Tourism
Minister Shin Nak-kyun.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries share similar historical and cultural
origins, Qian said, bilateral cultural exchanges constitute an
important part of Sino-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-ROK relationship has developed rapidly and
cultural exchanges are more and more frequent since the forging of
diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1992, and that he
hoped that the delegation's visit this time will further increase
exchanges between both cultural departments and enhance
understanding of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the global financial crisis, Qian expressed
his belief that the Asian economy will eventually land on the
right track of steady development despite the current global
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"We are anticipating ROK President Kim Dae-jung's visit to
China within the year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shin gave her gratitude for China's listing Korea as one of its
tourism destinations. "The decision opened a new page for cultural
exchanges between the two countries," she said.

ADDIS ABABA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) based in Arusha, Tanzania
will hand down Wednesday the first judgement on the crime of
genocide ever to be decided by an international court.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Wednesday by the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) said the tribunal will
pronounce, in a separate case, the first ever sentence for
genocide two days later.
</P>
<P>
"These landmark decisions will be the first to breathe life
into the genocide convention, which was adopted 50 years ago in
the wake of the holocaust of the Second World War," the press
release added.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was established by the United Nations Security
Council in November 1994 following the massacre of at least
500,000 people, mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a period of
just three months.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has the mandate to prosecute persons responsible
for genocide and other serious violations of international

<HEADLINE> Bomb Imported into Kenya as Relief Food Aid: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A key suspect in the deadly
August 7 Nairobi bombing has confessed here that materials for
making the bomb were brought into Kenya as part of relief food
consignments, a national newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Suspect Khalid Salim, also known as Mohamed Rashed Daoud
Al-Owhali, was quoted as saying that the materials were hidden
mainly in consignments of rice that came into Kenya through an
unregistered non-governmental organization (NGO).
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard report also claimed that a Kenyan
expert has identified the vehicle used in the bombing was a
Toyota Dyna, a three-ton pick-up manufactured 10 to 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting Salim, said the bombers started their
planning in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the terrorist squad had organized
themselves into a bogus NGO and, through relief operations, they
gathered the necessary ingredients used to make the bomb which
finally killed 253 people and wounded over 5,000 others, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The explosion leveled a five-storey commercial building and
extensively damaged the U.S. embassy and adjacent Cooperative
Bank House in the downtown area of the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Khalid, said to be a Yemeni, was the man who allegedly hurled
a grenade at the U.S. embassy moments before the bomb blast. His
confessions were made in Nairobi before the U.S. and Kenyan
investigators.
</P>
<P>
Khalid and another key suspect Mohammed Saddiq Howaida, were
transferred to the United States last week for trial on charge of
murder.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China Looks to Deficit Policy to Stimulate Economy -2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xinhua Writer Xu Xingtang
</P>
<P>
At present, China's fiscal deficit accounts for about 2.2
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), lower than the
internationally recognized warning line of three percent; while
the outstanding amount of government debt is expected to be 10.3
percent of the GDP by the end of this year, this is also lower
than that of most other countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is still much room for the government to expand the
scale of treasury bonds," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists hold that, with the recovering of the economy
and the deepening of economic reforms, the government will
gradually build its fiscal strength, and its ability to repay will
be constantly improved, so there should be no government debt
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wang Binsheng, a noted economist from the China Academy of
Social Sciences, said that although China issues more than 250
billion yuan in treasury bonds annually, and the outstanding
amount of treasury bonds exceeded 400 billion yuan by the end of
1997, it's still feasible for the government to appropriately
increase the issuance of treasury bonds, considering the endurance
of the national economy and the amount of personal savings.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the present stable market prices, low
interest rates and increased investment consciousness, treasury
bonds will be well received with its comparatively higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Well-known economist Zhang Liqun said that from the long-term
point of view, the present deficit policy does not contradict the
state's long-term target of gradually reducing the deficit. Economic
growth is a prerequisite for fiscal income growth, using fiscal
policies to improve economic growth creates sources of fiscal
income growth and enables deficit reduction in the long term.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Finance Lou Jiwei said that the 100 billion
yuan in treasury bonds will be coordinated by banks with about the
same amount of loans, which together will contribute more than two
percentage points to the GDP, giving a big boost to this year's
economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The representative of the United
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Bangladesh issued the State of
World Population Report 1998 here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the National Press Club, Alain P.
Mouchiroud, the representative of the UNFPA in Bangladesh, said
the country has made success in its population program by reducing
the growth rate of 3.0 percent in 1973 to 1.7 percent in 1997 with
a population of 124 million.
</P>
<P>
However, as the population in Bangladesh is very young with 43
percent below 15 years of age, the potential for future growth is
tremendous, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the more optimistic assumption, he said, the level of
replacement (two children per couple) would be reached in
Bangladesh by 2005, and in that case, the population would not be
able to be stabilized before 40 to 50 years, at a size of about
170 million.
</P>
<P>
A more realistic scenario shows that the population of the
Bangladesh could reach 200-250 million, and would stabilize
sometimes around the middle of the next century, according to
Mouchiroud.
</P>
<P>
Adolescents aged 10-19 years in the country represent a little
more than one-fifth of the total population at present, and would
rise to 22 percent in 2000 and 2005, and the youth, aged 15-29,
increased from 22 percent in 1974 to 15.7 percent in 1995 and
would further grow to 28.3 percent in 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country would face challenges in providing
education, nutrition, employment and health to the young
population, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the issue of the elderly, Mouchiroud said the
elderly has been largely overlooked, as not much has been done in
Bangladesh as in many other countries.
</P>
<P>
To call for more concern about the elderly, the United Nations
has declared 1999 as "The International Year of Older Persons," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Has No Pressing Need for Fighter Planes: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia at the moment has no
pressing need for new Russian Sukhois or U.S. F-16s, Chief of
Staff of the Indonesian Air Force Rear Marshall Hanafi Asnan was
quoted by Antara News Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need these fighters now, maybe within 10 years. What
we have at present are enough," he told reporters in the country's
second largest city of Surabaya Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the air force will just maximize the use of its F-16s
and British Aerospace Sky Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 10 F-16s and 24 units of British Aerospace Sky
Hawk 100 and 200.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia planned to purchase F-16s from the U.S. a few years
ago, Asnan said, but when this was blocked by the U.S. Congress,
Indonesia opted to buy Sukhois instead, which were cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Following the onslaught of the regional economic crisis,
Indonesia had to postpone its plan to purchase Sukhois, Asnan
added.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Sparks Power Emergency in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Californian authorities
Monday twice declared emergency after the power use neared record
levels, due to Southern California's current heat wave, according
to reports released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Independent System Operator (ISO), which operates California's
electric power grid, declared a "stage one" emergency Monday
morning, in which utilities urge customers to conserve power.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the ISO declared a "stage two" emergency
after power use neared record levels and caused intermittent power
outages in the region.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the emergency escalated to stage two when
the ISO determined that operating reserves had dipped below 5
percent. Utilities were then allowed to interrupt power to large
commercial and industrial customers with whom they have
prearranged agreements.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the California Energy Commission said the demand
for electricity in the state outstripped supply twice this summer,
as 33 million residents turned on their air-conditioners when
temperatures reached around 40 centigrade during most daytimes.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures, which reached record high during the past week,
showed no sign of decrease.
</P>
<P>
The sources say the worst kind of emergency is a "stage three,"
in which the state's electricity system is within 1.5 percent of
failure and utilities are allowed to begin rolling blackout.
</P>
<P>
But so far, California has never experienced a stage three
power emergency, they added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Former U.S. Secretaries of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the common task ahead for China and the United
States is to make continuous efforts to assure healthy and stable
Sino-U.S. relations into the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark while meeting with a U.S.-China Society
delegation led by Dr. Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance, both former
U.S. secretaries of state.
</P>
<P>
Jiang underlined that the recent improvement and growth of
Sino-U.S. ties is widely welcomed by the people of both countries
and has won positive comments worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The good development momentum in the past year ushered
bilateral ties into a new phase," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to President Jiang, the joint decision he made with
U.S. President Bill Clinton during his U.S. visit last fall set
the direction and framework for the growth of bilateral ties. "We
all agreed to accelerate the pace of building such a partnership
and enhance exchanges and cooperation in wide-ranging fields
during President Clinton's China trip at my invitation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed the visit of the delegation. "I should give my
special welcome to Dr. Kissinger for his thirtieth China visit,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Some 27 years have elapsed since your first China trip, and
Sino-U.S. ties have witnessed profound changes in that time,"
Jiang told Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have seen some turns and twists, bilateral
relations in general move forward," he said, adding that such
development is in the fundamental interest of the two countries in
the long run, and is itself an irreversible necessity of history.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised both Kissinger and Vance for their important
contributions in opening the gates of Sino-U.S. relations and the
normalization of bilateral ties, and hoped that they and other
friends continue efforts to improve Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed the guests on China's efforts to combat the
torrential flooding occurring this summer.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said the mutual visits paid by the leaders of the two
countries have brought bilateral ties into "the best period" in
recent years. He told Jiang that people in his country have
reached a wide consensus to develop ties with China, which are in
the interest of both countries.
</P>
<P>
He also appreciated China's responsible attitude during the
Asian financial crisis and expressed his sympathy for the
devastation of the recent serious flooding.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<HEADLINE> hke090227 -Asian Crisis Forces Australia to Lower Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia revised down its
economic growth forecasts for the current financial year
Wednesday, blaming global financial turmoil and the downturn in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said the nation's gross
domestic product (GDP) growth for 1998-99, which ends on June 30,
1999, was expected to come in at 2.75 percent rather than the 3
percent forecast by the government three months ago, but insisted
the economy remained strong.
</P>
<P>
"Treasury's economic forecasts for 1998-99 show that the
Australian economy continues to record solid growth and low
inflation in the face of the sharp slowdown in the Asian region
and a highly uncertain international environment," he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Gareth Evans, Australian shadow treasurer, rejected the
government's forecast as too optimistic, saying even the
downgraded figure was unlikely to be achievable, due to global
economic turmoil sparked by the tumbling Russian currency.
</P>
<P>
"We think 2.75 (percent growth) too optimistic for this
(financial) year," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"When the United States catches cold Australia is one of those
many economies around that will catch pneumonia. That's the
outlook for the period ahead, and as a result these projections
and forecasts are simply, in our forecasts, much too optimistic,"
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
Despite its close economic ties with Asia, which buys
two-thirds of all the goods and services Australia exports, the
Australian economy did quite well in the past financial year
ending on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Figures released Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics show the economy grew by 3.9 percent over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Some economists, however, warn that the worst is yet to come in
this financial year.

<HEADLINE> Lightening Touches off Wildfires in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lightning touched off
dozens of wildfires across Southern California early Tuesday
morning, destroying at least 100 structures, including 26 houses
or mobile homes, burning 30,000 acres of brush and timber, local
authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
The most destructive blaze was in Riverside County's Juniper
Flats, an area of dry, dense brush 85 miles southeast of Los
Angeles, where at least 36 structures, including 26 homes were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
At least five other blazes burned east of Los Angeles,
according to Bill Peters, a spokesman for the California
Department of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters also battled blazes around San Diego in the south,
and around San Francisco in the north, even in other Western
states, including Washington, Montana, Nevada and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
An inmate firefighter was killed and 11 others injured when a
truck headed for the front lines flipped.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures, heat, thunderstorms were blamed for the
destructive wildfires. Temperatures have reached record high in
most areas in Southern California during the past few days. On
Tuesday, thermometers once again reached above 40 centigrade in
most parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service warned that the risk of fire will
continue to climb, with high temperatures and thunderstorms
expected to continue through this week in Southern California.

<HEADLINE> Residents Return to Border Town in West China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Luo Zhengxi, 37, has
returned to his hometown of Qingshuihe in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, only 28 kilometer from China's western border
with the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"Had there not been the frontier trade, the town would not have
developed so rapidly and I would not have come back here to make a
living," said Luo, who is taking up private transportation as his
new field.
</P>
<P>
China implemented a policy of opening up its border areas in
the 1990s, which has stimulated frontier trade in such places as
Qingshuihe. These small towns, which had once been inhabited by
Chinese troops, have become a thriving location for both local and
foreign traders.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people have moved to the town in the past six
years. But, when China had strained relations with the Soviet
Union in the late 1950s to the 1970s, most of its residents --
including Luo -- left their hometown because of the military
buildup.
</P>
<P>
When Luo was six years old, conflicts arose at the border in
the late 1950s with the former Soviet Union. His mother took her
nine children huddled together on a train 80 kilometers inland
from the border.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the Luo family had to move again when a counterattack
at the border with Vietnam, put the western areas on alert. In a
packed truck, Luo -- then 16 -- saw military vehicles, tanks, and
artillery moving forward to the border.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hotels and other large commercial buildings now stand in
Qingshuihe where military vehicles once were stationed. Many local
people are now doing business with traders from the Commonwealth
of Independent States, which formerly was part of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
Though bargaining is part of the trading process, most traders
are satisfied with the end result. Fully loaded trucks fill the
40-meter-wide state highway connecting the town with the border.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jie, head of the town's economic and technical development
zone which was set up in 1992, said the town had almost no
infrastructure before the 1980s. But, since 1992, the government
has allocated 620 million yuan (about 75.6 million U.S. dollars)
to build up the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Now its special geographic position has become an advantage
for the town's development," said Xu, 35, the former top official
in Qingshuihe who recently concluded trade talks in
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The town has absorbed more than 600 million yuan of investment
from other parts of China and from abroad. The town government
plans to set up a foreign trade market for shoes with the
cooperation of traders from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw President Jiang Zemin shaking hands with leaders of
four countries sharing the western border with China on TV, I knew
I would never have to relocate my home," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
In early July this year, Jiang met with leaders of Kazakhstan,
Kyrghyzstan, Russia and Tadzhikistan in Alma-Ata, capital of
Kazakhstan. One of the results of the meeting was the resolution
of all problems along the 1,700-kilometer border with Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"The living experience in the border area tells me that a
single person's destiny is tightly connected with the country's
international standing and its policies," said Xu, adding that
the frontier trade will continue to be vigorous.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 2 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 Cambodian
students and supporters of the opposition parties held a large
demonstration Wednesday here to protest against the election
results released Tuesday by the National Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered at the front of the Royal Palace and
marched by the Independence Monument to the European Union office
here, shouting slogans against Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and
Vietnam, and saying that they would never accept the results as
announced by the NEC.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday official election results were released, showing
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen-led Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
winner of the election. The announcement came a day after the
Constitutional Council completed deliberations on the opposition's
appeals alleging election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition political parties, the FUNCINPEC and the Sam
Rainsy Party, immediately rejected the results and vowed to keep
up their struggle by organizing another mass demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in protest in front of the National Assembly entered
its 10th day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the FUNCINPEC, reiterated
Wednesday to his supporters at his party headquarters the four-
point joint statement made by him and Sam Rainsy Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties vowed not to participate in the new
parliament until their election fraud complaints are addressed and
an earlier seat allocation formula is adopted.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen is expected to fly to Siem Reap
Thursday to discuss the deadlock with King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
He will most likely put forward his idea of getting the
Assembly members to amend the constitution so that the CPP could
form a government with only a simple majority, rather than
two-thirds.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Contacts between the Chinese
and Israeli armies have been on the rise as relations between the
two countries grow, President Jiang Zemin told visiting Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also Chairman of the Central Military Commission, said
he hopes to further promote friendly cooperative ties between the
two armies.
</P>
<P>
He said that since China and Israel forged diplomatic ties,
friendly bilateral relations have developed continuously and
steadily, and bilateral cooperation has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of visit between various sectors at all levels
have served to deepen mutual understanding and friendship between
the two peoples, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East, Jiang said the Chinese government has all
along been very concerned with the peace process and the situation
in that region.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a wise decision for Israel and all other
concerned parties to comply with the historic trends and seek to
settle disputes through peaceful negotiations, as this is not only
in the practical and long-term interests of both sides, but also
beneficial to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that relevant U.N. resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle set at the Madrid peace conference are
the basis for the Middle East peace talks and the basic terms to
guarantee the security and stability of relevant countries," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope the Middle East peace gets out of the
deadlock at an early date and scores effective results," the
Chinese president added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed his Israeli guests on the recent flood
control efforts in China. He thanked Mordechai for donating
medicines to the disaster-ravaged people.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai expressed his sympathy and solicitude for the people
in the flood-hit regions and donated, on behalf of his government,
55,000 U.S. dollars worth of medicine.
</P>
<P>
He stated that he is glad to visit China and exchange views
with Chinese leaders on issues of common concern. Mordechai said
he hopes his current visit would serve to further the friendly
cooperative relations between the two nations and the two
armies.
</P>
<P>
The minister also briefed Jiang on the current Middle East
situation.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai arrived in Beijing Monday for a four-day official
visit as guest of his Chinese counterpart, Chi Haotian, who is
also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and State
Councillor.
</P>
<P>
Chi was present at today's meeting. The two defense ministers
are scheduled to hold talks later today.

<HEADLINE> Technical Correspondence School Helps Farmers Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Lu Xiumei, a 42-year-old
farmer, had never thought of being a technician before she was
enrolled for a certificate program sponsored by the Zhejiang
Provincial Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from a technical correspondence school five
years ago, Lu, a villager at Wenling City in east China's Zhejiang
Province, has successfully improved the standard of living for
herself and her disabled husband.
</P>
<P>
While receiving correspondence lessons on sea farming, she
started to cultivate various marine products by taking advantage
of aquatic agricultural techniques, and is now able to earn an
annual income of more than 200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The great changes in my life can be attributed to the Rural
Technical Correspondence School," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The school, led by China's Association for Science and
Technology, was established in 1985 with its purpose to teach
farmers applied technology for helping them rise above the poverty
level.
</P>
<P>
There are 88 branch schools in Zhejiang and various guidance
organizations in its 900 towns, said Wang Yangjie, an official
with Zhejiang's Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Zhejiang is launching a program to popularize
new technology among female villagers. At present, more than 60
percent of rural laborers in Zhejiang are women.
</P>
<P>
He said that 14,000 out of 60,000 female farmer trainees have
received the "Farming Technician Certificate."
</P>
<P>
A total of 500 training classes have been opened especially for
female villagers in Zhejiang since 1994, including the growing of
flowers and plants, aquatic farming, English and computer
applications.

<HEADLINE> Survey: China Serious about Public Security, Situation Disturbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) - China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), has
found in a recent survey that local governments are serious about
instituting a comprehensive public security mechanism in
communities and people feel safer today.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also revealed that the general security
situation is still worrisome and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
"The comprehensive management of public security is still a
long-term and arduous task, and governments at various levels
should never let up in their efforts," said Cao Zhi, vice-chairman
of the top lawmaking body, at a meeting concluding the survey.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee sent three teams in July to Hainan,
Jiangsu and Jilin provinces to look into how a law on public
security was enforced.
</P>
<P>
Seven local legislatures in other provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities have been authorized to conduct inspections in
areas under their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
According to the checks, local governments are very interested
in establishing a system called "safer and civilized communities"
which mobilizes the public to help police. They pay equal
attention to crime prevention and crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that, because of this system, localities are able to
safeguard the general stability of the society while deepening
reforms, opening up and maintaining sustained and rapid economic
growth.

<P>
The recent internal shake-up inside judiciaries and their
efforts to ensure justice have also been fruitful, and have won
applause from the public, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
However, the present security situation is still "rather
serious," legislators said.
</P>
<P>
They said criminal rates are rising; the problems of murder,
robbery, explosion, thefts are prominent; prostitution, gambling
and drug-related social vices persist despite repeated police
raids; gang crimes, juvenile delinquency, and felonies perpetrated
by migrants are sharply increasing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police have intensified their fights against criminal
gangs and smashed many since 1996, but the public have reported
that such gangs are still spreading in number and influence, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 60 percent of suspected criminals
landing in the hands of police are now minors.
</P>
<P>
Inspection teams also proposed several solutions for the
worsening situation. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- The "Strike-Hard" drive must continue to curb the rising
crime rates;
</P>
<P>
-- The community-level security network must be spread and
instituted all across the country, because surveys have found
those places with poor security are also lax in enforcing this
system;
</P>
<P>
-- And, most importantly, leaders at all levels must first
realize the present situation and never slacken their work of
comprehensive management of public security.

JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- After the breakdown of
over-night negotiations with the Treasury, Israeli teachers'
unions declared on Wednesday that they will continue the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike will keep the nation's 1.2 million students at home

<P>
But Treasury wage director Yossi Kucik said he hoped the
teachers unions would "come to their senses and agree to a
reasonable wage agreement."
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials said that teachers are demanding an 8
percent salary increase, while they will agree only to a 5
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yitzhak Levy said that he would
ask Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to intervene and convene a

</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):

-- Addressing a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said the current Russian financial crisis has not
affected Turkey's economy that much, but the government must
remain cautious.
</P>
<P>
Russia's crisis has caused turmoil on the Turkish markets due
to closer economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Minister of Justice Hasan Denizkurdu is expected to
go to Paris to discuss with French officials the extradition of
Turkish mafia boss Alaattin Cakici who was arrested last month in

</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Cakici has been wanted by the police on an

closed by the Constitutional Court for its alleged anti-secular
tendency.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Donations for Children in Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chinese
Ministry of Education is calling for an emergency donation from
China and abroad for solving the difficulties facing the children
in the country's flood-ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the critical issues is helping children
return to schools and avoid diseases at the current stage of the
flooding fighting.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a number of children are still living in temporary
houses on dikes waiting for the reopening of schools, and some of
them are facing living difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the educational departments have taken many methods to
solve the problems, he said, "the lack of money is the biggest
problem."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 44,000 school buildings were
destroyed by flooding this summer, which brought problems to 8.47
million primary and secondary students and caused losses of 7.6
billion yuan (about 900 million U.S. dollars) in the educational
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set a goal to ensure all the
flood-affected schools to reopen in the autumn, when the new
semester begins.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Ministry of Education and China
Central Television (CCTV) will hold a charity show to raise
money on Sept. 10, which is the country's Teacher's Day.
</P>
<P>
The theatrical performance with the theme of "Helping Children
in Flood-Affected Areas" is expected to attract worldwide
attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
The money raised at the evening party will be directly used for
rebuilding schools and aiding poverty-stricken families of
students, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Inflation Registers Mild Rises in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai consumer prices rose 7.6
percent year-on-year in August, while wholesale prices jumped 12.9
percent in a significant moderation of the country's inflation
rate.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Commerce Ministry said in a statement available here
Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 129.4, up
0.4 percent from July. In July the index was up 10 percent
year-on-year, while the wholesale price index shot up 19.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation as measured by the CPI has eased from a peak in June
of 10.7 percent year-on-year, the biggest increase in the decade.
</P>
<P>
The float of the baht on July 2, 1997, and its subsequent
depreciation by more than 36 percent has doubled the inflation
rate from levels seen in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has set a 9.2 percent
target for the CPI increase in 1998 as a condition for promising
Thailand a 17.2-billion-U.S. dollar economic rescue package.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of the year, consumer prices rose 9.5
percent from the same period last year, while wholesale prices
were up 18.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Karun Kittiaporn, director general of the ministry's Business
Economics Department, said the rate of increase in consumer prices
has begun to fall due to a decline in the inflation rate for food
and beverage prices.
</P>
<P>
Food and beverage prices were up 0.7 percent from July, but the
year-on-year increase in August was 7.4 percent, down from 11.8
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Food prices account for 35.28 percent of the consumer index.
Eggs and dairy products accounted for the biggest jump in the
category, rising 18.3 percent year-on-year, and 0.2 percent
month-on-month. Rice and starch products rose 15.3 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Non-food prices rose 8.2 percent year-on-year in August, and
0.2 percent from July. Tobacco and alcoholic beverages accounted
for the biggest increase in the category, rising 22.5 percent
year-on-year, and 0.4 percent month-on-month.
</P>
<P>
Prices of agricultural and food products in the wholesale index
rose 15.6 percent year-on-year. In the manufacturing sector,
wholesale prices were up 11.1 percent year-on-year in August, but
dropped 0.6 percent on July.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said monthly year-on-year figures should continue to
decline in the second half of 1998 as the comparisons will be
against the months in 1997 after the float of the baht, when
prices had already begun to rise.

JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading South African Newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The Citizen:
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday urged
the United States and other countries that had not signed the
statute constituting the International Criminal Court to do so.
He said it was a tragedy to say that the court would prevent
processes such as South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Star:
</P>
<P>
-- The 12th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement peaks Wednesday
after leaders of the developing world jetted into Durban Tuesday

the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Business Day:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite belligerent statements by ministers from the
Democratic Republic of Congo Tuesday afternoon, prospects for a
peaceful resolution to that country's crisis appeared to brighten
that night as key players in the conflict arrived in Durban for
the Non-Aligned Movement summit.
</P>
<P>
Sowetan:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Suspension of ProCQ%iBQ%=9J9*u+V,*Y5ected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
rejected a wholesale suspension of the privatization process as
demanded by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The suspension will cause too much damage and cessation of
external donor funding, Wednesday's New Vision daily quoted a
senior official as saying.
 Xtthew Rukikaire, the Minister of State for Finance, told
Parliament Tuesday that the sale of some enterprises can be
temporarily halted, but the privatization process should continue
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
This is the government's first official stance on the August
18 resolution of Parliament calling for a 45-day suspension of
the process to facilitate investigations into alleged rampant
corruption in the process.
</P>
<P>
Suspension of the process, even for one month, would have
wide-ranging implications, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some officials have reportedly demanded large sums of
commission in the sale of the Sheraton Hotel and some other
parastatals in this east African country. Parliament convened
and passed a resolution appealing for suspension of the
privatization process and investigation into the sale of these
enterprises.

Alexandria-Dumyat coastal road would be built by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The road estimated to cost 1.5 billion Egypt pounds (442 million
U.S. dollars) forms part of the 1,200-kilometer-long highway from
Rafah in the east to Salloum in the west along the Mediterranean
coast, connecting Egypt's northern governorates, said the Arab
daily Al Hayat on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soleiman said the highway would promote development in the
regions along it by developing tourist resorts, implementing land
reclamation, setting up industrial zones, exploiting fisheries and
enhancing internal and international trade.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Chairman of Egypt's Cotton Exporters Federation Saeed
Haggas has said the export prices of cotton have dropped by 5 to
10 percent from the 1997-98 season, the Egyptian Alam Al Yom daily

TUNIS -- More than 1.9 million tourists visited Tunisia in the
first half of this year, increasing by 6.3 percent from the figure

<HEADLINE> Crop Damages by Flood in Bangladesh Worse Than 1988 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The damage of crops by
devastating flood this year is feared to be at least three times
more than that caused by the 1988 floods since the duration of
flood this year has crossed all previous records, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
Though the flood-affected area this year is smaller than that
of 1988, the crop loss is much bigger than in 1988.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60,000 square-kilometer area has been submerged by
floods this year, compared to 90,000 square kilometers in 1988,
The Daily Star newspaper Wednesday quoted experts in the
Meteorological Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The flood water has this year been above the danger level for
about one month and a half since July 10 while it was only for 15
days in 1988, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The three major rivers -- Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna --
have been flowing above their respective danger marks since July
10 this year, but the rivers crossed their red marks on September
1 in 1988, they added.
</P>
<P>
Though the flood water had started receding, the rate of
recession was very slow and the process might take another 10 days
to be faster, they observed.
</P>
<P>
Crop loss might stand at three million tons this year, compared
to some one million tons in 1988, since 60 percent of rice crop
had been seriously affected by flood, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, except some low-lying areas, rice crop withstood the
flood water because of its late advent and short duration, but
this year, the flood hit early and peasants in most of flood-hit
areas even could not plant rice seedlings because seed beds had
been damaged, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Crop on more than 214,000 hectares have been damaged and washed
away by nearly two-month-long devastating flood, with an estimated
crop loss amounting to 14.22 billion taka (302.6 million U.S.
dollars), the Ministry of Agriculture said.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Survives, Graf Wins in U.S. Open First Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Patrick
Rafter of Australia was almost crushed by an underdog from
Morocco in the first round of the U.S. Open tennis championships
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Rafter came back from two sets down to edge Hicham
Arazi 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 to survive an astonishing defeat.
Five time champion Steffi Graf of Germany battled past promising
American Corna Morariu 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 in a first round women's
match.
</P>
<P>
Never has a defending singles champion at the U.S. Open lost
in the first round, but the Australian almost made a history
tonight.It was the fourth time Rafter has rallied from a two-set
deficit to win and his ninth straight five-set win. He is 10-2
overall in five-setters.
</P>
<P>
Arazi appeared to be in control of what would have been by far
the biggest upset of the tournament's first two days, up two sets
and two points away from a 3-1 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
But he came unglued after a line call went against him at that
point and argued repeately with umpire the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the ponytailed third best in the world, hurt himself
with mistakes in the first two sets but steadied as Arazi
unraveled.
</P>
<P>
"I hate umpires, guys in the chair, I hate them!" Arazi
screamed.
</P>
<P>
"Down 2-0 I figured I had a fine vacation coming, be able to
watch Pearl Jam," said Rafter, "But I hung in there and came
back."
</P>
<P>
Greg Rusedski, last year's runner-up and the sixth seed this
time, also survived a five-set battle with Wayne Ferreira 4-6,
7-6(7-2), 5-7, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Today's action featured several top women players. Second
seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States routed Catalina
Cristea of Romania 6-0, 6-2. Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion
who is seeded third, fought off Jennifer Capriati of the United
States 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Arantx Sanchez Vicario of Spain, the reigning
French Open champion, swept past Kristina Brandi of the United
States 6-2,6-2.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed American Venus Williams, a finalist here last
year,became the last of the 16 seeded women to advance to the
second round as she breezed past Germany's Elena Wagner 6-1, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Conchita Martinez of Spain ousted Miriam Oremans
of the Netherlans 6-1, 6-2; 10th seed Nathalie Tauziat of French
downed Flora Perfetti of Italy 6-3, 6-2; and 12th seed Mary
Pierce of France held off Meike Babel of Germany 6-1, 4-6, 6-2.
Anna Lournikova of Russia also sailed into the second round.
</P>
<P>
However, there was one seed ousted in the men's action today
when Oliver Gross of Germany outdueled No. 16 Albert Costa of
Spain 2-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sharemarket Bounces Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand sharemarket
 bounced back Wednesday after Tuesday's dramatic falls, with
investors rushing to take advantage of cheap prices of stocks.
</P>
<P>
According to the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA), the key
NZSE40 Capital Index gained 2.9 percent this morning, with early
trading dominated by price rises.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the NZSE40 Capital Index dropped 4 percent, with a
total of more than 1.5 billion New Zealand dollars (750 million
U.S. dollars) wiped off the value of New Zealand shares.
</P>
<P>
Today's boost for the New Zealand Sharemarket did not help
troubled Brierley Investments. The company's share price slumped
to a record low of 61 cents this morning from uncertainty about
the leadership and direction of the company, the NZPA reported.
</P>
<P>
But, the prices of most other leading stocks, including
Telecom, Colonial, Telstra, Air New Zealand, AMP and National
Mutual, rose this morning.
</P>
<P>
Auckland Airport's better-than-forecast profit result also gave
 its share price a boost.
</P>
<P>
But brokers remained nervous, saying markets were volatile and
volumes were light, the NZPA said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the performance of the New Zealand dollar and
interest rates was also good. This morning, the New Zealand dollar
was trading at 50.38 cents of the U.S. dollar, while wholesale
interest rates were hovering above six percent.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the New Zealand dollar hit 12-year lows, trading at
prices of slightly over 48 cents of the U.S. dollar.

Representatives of Canada's largest airline and its pilots had
been staying up in a Toronto hotel Tuesday night to try to break
the impasse.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are demanding substantial pay increases and improved
working conditions. Air Canada has refused to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
"Flights are canceled until we are able to negotiate a
settlement and we can get the pilots back to work," said a
spokesperson of Air Canada.
</P>
<P>
The strike at the Montreal-based airline would ground its 166
planes and send many of its 22,000 employees home. It would also
disrupt traveling plans of many Canadians.
</P>
<P>
The airline is reported to have made arrangements with 15 other
air carriers around the world to take its passengers in the event
of a strike.

SANTIAGO -- The Economic Commission for Latin America and the

inflation at a rate of about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "Economic Study of Latin America and the
Caribbean 1997-1998," the ECLA pointed out that the stability of
pricing was one of the regional countries' main economic
achievements.
</P>
<P>
It said that on an average, regional inflation fell from 18
percent in 1996, to about 10 percent in 1997, the second lowest in

SANTIAGO -- The economies of Latin America and the Caribbean
will grow by nearly three percent in 1998, the Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLA) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Economic Study of Latin American and the
Caribbean," was issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that 1997 was a very successful year for many economies
in the region, with 5.3 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
But external events, including the El Nino weather phenomenon
and the Asian financial crisis, may prevent the region's economies
from growing that rapidly this year, said the
report. (LATAM-Economic Growth)

"We have experienced unsatisfactory financial performance with

KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysia's ringgit will be pegged by Bank

Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With a fixed rate, people will know the real value of the
ringgit and "once we regain control of our exchange rate, we can
lower our interest rates and nobody else control our interest
rates," Mahathir said during a special interview on the country's
economic situation over radio and television which was telecast
live.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said a fixed ringgit might affect transaction costs
but with fixed rates, there was no need to hedge while the
transaction cost will not be subject to devaluation or revaluation
if paid at a later date, and also it would enable interest rates
to be lowered.
</P>
<P>
But the rate will be decided by market forces for the time
being, he said. (Malaysia-Currency)

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Latin America Stabilized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLA) Tuesday praised regional
countries for keeping inflation at a rate of about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "Economic Study of Latin America and the
Caribbean 1997-1998," the ECLA pointed out that the stability of
pricing was one of the regional countries' main economic
achievements.
</P>
<P>
It said that on an average, regional inflation fell from 18
percent in 1996, to about 10 percent in 1997, the second lowest in
half a century.
</P>
<P>
But inflation in the first half of this year increased
slightly, which does not mean a setback overshadowing what has
already been achieved, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Most Latin American countries witnessed low inflation in 1997
and 1998. Out of 19 countries, 10 countries maintained a one-digit
inflation rate in both years. Seven countries stayed between 10-20
percent. Only Ecuador and Venezuela registered an inflated price
increase between 30-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflationary pressures coming from the growing internal demand
could be stabilized, thanks to the important increase in foreign
demand. At the same time, labor force expansion has helped to
mitigate the increase in wages, the document adds.
</P>
<P>
The rise in inflation, or its suspension in some countries, may
be explained partially by the El Nino climate phenomenon, which
generated major losses in agriculture. As a consequence, there
were significant increases in the prices of some crops in high
demand.
</P>
<P>
There were also other factors influencing inflation, such as
the adjustment in public services prices, government regulations
and the devaluation of some currencies.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the reduction in the prices of some imports,
especially oil, has facilitated stabilization efforts, according
to the report.

SOFIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian lev edged up
further to 1,738-1,739 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, up from
Monday's 1,757-1,758 lev to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The increasing demand for foreign exchange caused by the rise
of lev has pushed up the Deutsch mark against the lev to one for
996.50-995.50, said a dealer.
</P>
<P>
The lev may strengthen to 1,720-1,730 if the dollar continues
to drop against the mark, while the level of one mark to 997 levs
was impossible, a Raiffeisenbank dealer said.
</P>
<P>
An ING bank dealer said that even financial experts could not
understand events in the markets because the volatile situation in
Russia made any forecasts impossible.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Brady bonds partially reclaimed their positions in
the international markets Tuesday though their price rose seven to
eight percentage points from Monday, said a Bulbank dealer.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday the governor of the central bank Svetoslav
Gavriiski refused to comment on the possibility of Bulgaria
repaying a share of its external debt while the Brady bonds were
low.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to reveal whether Bulgarian banks in Russia had
been hit by the crisis there.
</P>
<P>
A Bulgarian-Russian Investment Bank official was quoted by the
Bulgarian Telegraph Agency as saying: "We have become very careful
and minimized our activity in the Russian market."

ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's policy
toward Tibet has proved right and produced positive results, an
Italian legislator said on Tuesday after an 11-day visit by a
parliamentary delegation to the Chinese autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Renzo Gubert, chairman of the Italian Parliamentary Friendship
Association with China, said members of the delegation agreed
unanimously that the Chinese government has made positive
achievements in improving the infrastructure and preserving
cultural relics in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The government has also helped to improve the living standards
in Tibet and promote exchanges with other regions in China, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the delegation saw a wide freedom of religious belief
and great efforts in protecting and maintaining the numerous
monasteries in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language was being taught in schools, traditional
Tibetan medicine is practised while young Tibetan men are exempt

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Okays Plan on State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved a master plan to streamline the process of privatization
of state-owned enterprises, a government press release available
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, one panel under the prime minister would take
over all charge of the selling-off of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The State Enterprise Policy Committee is presently chaired by
Supachai Panitchpakdi, deputy prime minister, while new State
Enterprise Reform Committee would soon be established.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the goal of the master plan is
"to increase the efficiency of the economy, to provide a basis
from which Thai companies can compete internationally, and to
ensure quality goods and services are available to the Thai public
at the least cost."
</P>
<P>
Under the master plan, the state will look to "exit" from
enterprise operations.
</P>
<P>
"The state's role will primarily be as policy maker and
regulator, ensuring public goods and services are properly
delivered, protecting consumers, and providing a level playing
field for active competition between private sector entities," the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
However, the state will maintain its role in investment related
to national development such as in public health and education.
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of methods of privatization may be used by
enterprises and the state to accomplish the reform objectives.
This includes divestiture, deregulation, and licensing of private
sector participants.
</P>
<P>
Private parties wishing to invest in state enterprises would be
required to negotiate with the appropriate ministry or the State
Enterprise Office.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to legislate to ensure smooth
implementation for fear that existing laws would complicate the
process and amendments would cause delays.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the privatization would be split equally, with
the first half being used to fund needed social services such as
education, public health, labor welfare and agriculture, and the
other half for repayment of loans to Financial Institutions
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
There are 59 state enterprises in Thailand, which can be
broadly categorized into five major sectors: telecommunication,
water, energy, transport and others.
</P>
<P>
The total number of state owned enterprise employees currently
stands at about 320,000, with the top ten largest entities
employing over 226,000 individuals.

YANGON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been carrying out
Education for All Programme laid down by the World Education
Conference held in Thailand in 1990, a senior Myanmar official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The programme is being implemented in the country as a national
task with the aims of providing education for all, Myanmar Deputy
Minister for Education Brigadier-General Soe Win Maung said on

people complete the primary education and reducing the adult
illiteracy rate from 22 per cent to 11 by the year 2000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Opinion Poll Confirms Tight Election Race in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Results of a new poll
released here Wednesday confirmed that the two main Australian
parties were running a tight race for voter support even before
the election campaign began this week.
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll published by Bulletin, the nation's
weekly news magazine, shows that 40 percent of voters favored the
Australian Labor Party, with 36 percent voters favored the ruling
coalition and six percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition consists of the Australian Liberal Party,
which represents the nation's industrial and business groups, and
the Australian National Party that represents Australian farmers.
</P>
<P>
But the Bulletin said it had adopted a new style of opinion
testing for the election campaign that showed the coalition could
pick up more votes than Labor from undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
About a third of the undecided voters described themselves as
leaning towards the Liberal Party while 15 percent favored the
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The poll gave five percent of the primary vote to One Nation
Party with only three percent of undecided voters saying they
could support it.
</P>
<P>
The Bulletin poll contrasts with a Newspoll conducted for The
Australian, the nation's leading newspaper, also taken at the
weekend, that showed the coalition and the Labor Party both
enjoyed the support from 40 percent of the voters polled, with 10
percent voters for the One Nation Party founded last year by
racist MP Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
It is feared Pauline Hanson's party may hold the balance of
power in parliament to be elected, which would enable the party to
exert substantial influence on Australia's politics.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard announced on August 30
that a federal election would be held on October 3.

CARACAS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,000 doctors in public
institutions in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas went on strike
for higher pay on Tuesday morning, stopping services in least 20
hospitals and more than 600 clinics.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are calling for a basic wage of 600,000 bolivares
(some 1,050 U.S. dollars) and urging the government to block the
health and social security law and to keep open the Venezuelan
Institute of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
The doctors also complained about a lack of hospital materials
and the scarcity of medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan government dismissed their complaints as
senseless. Labor Minister Maria Bernardoni warned that if
emergency cases were not attended to during the strike, the
government might issue a compulsory order for all doctors to
return to work.
</P>
<P>
The medical strike is expected to spread to other states,
including Lara, Sucre, Zulia, Tachira, Yaracuy and Miranda,

<HEADLINE> ECLA: Latin American Economies to Grow 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The economies of Latin
America and the Caribbean will grow by nearly three percent in
1998, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLA) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Economic Study of Latin American and the
Caribbean," was issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that 1997 was a very successful year for many economies
in the region, with 5.3 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
But external events, including the El Nino weather phenomenon
and the Asian financial crisis, may prevent the region's economies
from growing that rapidly this year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that unemployment in the region may increase and
inflation, which dropped in 1997, will rise to 10.9 percent by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Deficits are expected to grow to a total of 75 billion
U.S. dollars, which represents 3.7 percent of gross domestic
products (GDP), compared to 3.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
El Nino has caused catastrophic floods and droughts in the
region, damaging agricultural products as well as fishing
production.
</P>
<P>
It also resulted in low economic growth rates, higher inflation
and pressures on the balance of payments, due to export
contractions and the import growth, added the report.
</P>
<P>
Asia's financial crisis is having another negative impact on
the region's economy. It has caused a reduction in foreign trade
volume and a fall in export prices.
</P>
<P>
The region's finances have been also affected by speculation on
the money and stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the rapid and vigorous reaction from the regional
governments, the impacts on the region have been "relatively
moderate."
</P>
<P>
But the report warned countries in the region to maintain a
cautious attitude toward their economies as the Asian crisis could
last longer than expected and new problems such as in Russia could
appear.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Panama's financial system
registered a considerable rise in bank subsidiaries over the last
three years, according to the Superintendency on Banking and
Insurance (SBI).
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, there were 232 subsidiaries throughout the
country, the SBI said.
</P>
<P>
A year later, in 1996, subsidiaries of the principal banks
operating in Panama amounted to 242 and last year they reached 266.
</P>
<P>
The opening of bank subsidiaries was a "boom in Panama, having
appeared just like mushrooms after rain," said the report by the
institution that regulates banking in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The SBI attributed the rise to competitiveness among banks.
</P>
<P>
Panama's International Banking Center is made up of 104 banks
and employs 10,958 people, of whom 10,775 are Panamanians and 183
foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Company Cuts Investment to Shore Up Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's oil company, the
PDVSA, has decided to cut 10 billion U.S. dollars in investments
from its expansion plan in an effort to shore up dwindling oil
prices on the international market, the local press reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A company source told the local media that original projections
were calculated at 65 billion U.S. dollars, but were revised
downward to 55 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The PDVSA's expansion plan is based on a 10-year schedule,
which starts in 1999 and ends in 2008. Its objective is to create
new market opportunities via production.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2001, it expects to raise oil production between
4.4 to 4.7 million barrels per day. By the year 2008, this amount
will increase to 5.5 to 6.4 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Investment reduction, originally drafted in the expansion plan
of PDVSA, is one of the consequences of the government's decision
to cut oil production by 525,000 barrels per day to 2.8 million
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this strategy, agreed upon at the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is to stabilize oil
prices in the international marketplace.

<HEADLINE> Big Merger Reported in China's Liqueur-Producing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Two major liqueur producers in
southwest China's Guizhou Province, the China Guizhou Maotai
Liqueur (Group) Co. Ltd. and the Guizhou Xijiu Liqueur
Association, merged here recently.
</P>
<P>
Maotai, known as China's "national liqueur", has remained
popular among consumers. However, the Maotai Group has for quite a
long time failed to produce the liqueur in large  quantities to
meet the demands of domestic and overseas customers.
</P>
<P>
The Guizhou association has been operating at a loss for years
with some 600 million yuan worth of facilities lying idle.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the local government, the Maotai Group sent
10 managers to the Xijiu association and invested 4.5 million yuan
in the nearby firm, which helped improve its management and
enlarge the consumer market in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Renguo, general manager of the Maotai Group, said the
merger increases the Maotai Group's total asset value to 2.34
billion yuan, up from 1.74 billion yuan, and its annual production
capacity is expected to jump to 20,000 tons, up from the present
4,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> New Rules to Cut Car Emissions in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A new set of standards for
vehicle emissions will be implemented in Beijing next year, aiming
to cut 80 percent of the main pollutants in new cars' exhaust
fumes.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Yu Xiaoxuan, deputy-director of the
Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, as saying that this set
of standards would be the strictest local emission regulations in
the country.
</P>
<P>
If the new cars do not meet the new standards, they would not
be allowed to be sold or licensed in the city, according to the
newspaper. Every year more than 100,000 new vehicles hit the
roads in the city.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau
said current emission standards were at about the same level as
those in Europe during the 1970s. The new standards would match
European ones from around 1992.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 74 percent of hydrocarbons, 63 percent of
carbon monoxide and 37 percent of the nitrogen oxides in the
city's air come from vehicle exhaust.
</P>
<P>
Yu said emissions became a problem because the current
standards on car exhausts were not strict enough, allowing a
single car to discharge more pollutants than it should, because
automobiles on the road lacked maintenance, and road conditions
lag behind the rapid increase in automobile numbers.
</P>
<P>
To enforce the new standards, cars will have environmental
equipment that includes electronically controlled ignitions and
catalytic converters, said Yu.
</P>
<P>
At present, only unleaded petroleum is being sold in
Beijing. According to statistics from the State Environmental
Protection Administration, by June of 1998, a total of 17
provinces and cities adopted unleaded petroleum regulations.

<HEADLINE> Published Japanese Photos Illustrate War Crimes in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A recently discovered
collection of photos published by Japan 60 years ago provides
additional evidence of crimes committed by Japanese invaders
against China in the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Xu Li, a retired cadre in his 70s, bought a Japan-published
album half a century ago. He recently donated the rare document to
the archives museum in Yangzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
With a brown hard cover, the album includes more than 200
pictures taken by Japanese war correspondents showing collapsed
city walls, destroyed houses and buildings, and demolished streets.
</P>
<P>
The photo collection was published in 1938 when Japan conquered
several major Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing
and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese militarists hoped to make a show of its armed forces
by publishing such a collection," said an expert in the Nanjing
Museum.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that the collection has a Japan-made Chinese map,
on which Japan divided the northern parts of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province and Ningxia region out of China and labeled
"leased territories" on Taiwan and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Garuda Indonesia to lay off 3,000 Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Troubled national flag carrier
Garuda Indonesia will lay off at least 3,000 of its nearly 13,000
employees as early as next month as part of a massive
restructuring program, the airline's president, Robby Djohan, said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dismissals, starting in early October, would be just one of
several moves designed to enable the airline to survive the
deepening crisis, the Jakarta Post daily Wednesday quoted Robby as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Garuda is one of the East Asian airlines that are suffering
from weak sales and ballooning costs denominated in foreign
currencies. Indonesia's economic crisis and the collapse of the
rupiah currency has hurt the airline badly.
</P>
<P>
As of last July, Garuda had a total of 12,732 employees,
including 709 pilots.
</P>
<P>
Robby said last Friday that Garuda current ratio of employees
to aircraft was 273 to one -- much higher than the ideal ratio of
167 to each airplane. Garuda currently operates 50 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He said the airline needed at least 100 million U.S. dollars in
financing to help the company move forward with its restructuring
plans.
</P>
<P>
The airline also plans to switch to Boeing 737-300 planes from
other aircraft now being used for domestic routes to improve
efficiency and cut costs, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dini Says Europe Cannot Abandon Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Amid Russia's serious political
and economic crisis, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
Tuesday that Europe cannot abandon Russia in its hour of need
since Germany was not deserted after World War II.
</P>
<P>
At a conference attended by the country's 127 ambassadors, Dini
said Russia "will be a talking partner in the future." Without
Russia, the dialogue between the East and West would be less
fundamental and more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also stressed the necessity of making the
Group of Eight (the West's seven industrialized nations plus
Russia) into a permanent "consultation mechanism" which would
enable the eight nations to achieve concerted action to avoid the
risk of a global recession.
</P>
<P>
The G8 should act as a "command bridge" between the East and
West, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Dini also outlined Italy's foreign policy on
European integration, trans-Atlantic relations and its ties with
other Mediterranean countries.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Government Unveils 1999 Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government
presented its draft 1999 budget, which aims to get the country out
of the red for the first time in a decade, to parliament on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The budget forecasts 187.1 billion Finnish marks (34.56 billion
U.S. dollars) in state revenue and 186.83 billion marks (34.6
billion dollars) in expenditure, with a small favorable balance of
270 million marks (50 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government's retrenchment measures include trimming the
state-subsidized housing program, putting off certain public
infrastructure projects and cutting back administration and
defense expenditures.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government is committed to increasing
investment in scientific research and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget is mainly focussed on ensuring sustained
economic growth and creating jobs, the government stressed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said the new budget would be
historic, as he expected it to put an end to Finland's ever
increasing debts.

<HEADLINE> China to Send Young Soccer Team for Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China is set to send its
under-23 soccer side to compete at this year's Asian Games in
Thailand, national team boss Bob Houghton said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Football Association (CFA) has yet to confirm the
news but said the formal announcement would come shortly.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming decision will be welcomed by the Asian
Football Confederation (AFC), who is recommending an under-23
rule on the soccer tournament of the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
AFC secretary general Peter Velappan said in July that the
event should be a showcase for the continent's young talents but
added that the final decision rests with each nation's soccer
association.
</P>
<P>
It would be a fitting move given both Japan and South Korea,
the main contenders for the Games soccer title, had announced to
field an under-23 Olympic side for the tournament, Houghton said
at the national team's training camp in the northeastern Chinese
city Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Bangkok Games, slated from September 6 to 20, will
provide useful competitive chances to the young side before they
kick off their 2000 Olympics soccer qualifying campaign, the
Englishman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy's education expenditures,
which is reportedly the lowest amount in its national budget,
ranks last among the European countries, press reports said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Italy's expenditure in public education has
fallen from 67.882 trillion lire (39 billion U.S. dollars) in 1993
to 59.594 trillion lire (35 billion dollars) in 1997, which
accounts for 3.4 percent of its total gross national product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The fall was the fastest and greatest among European
countries. Few countries in Europe cut their money in public
education on so great a scale as Italy, while most increased their
spending.
</P>
<P>
Finland's public education expenditure, which was the greatest
amount in its budget, amounted to about 7.9 percent of the GDP and
first place in Europe. It was followed by Sweden, 6.8 percent,
Denmark, 6.7 percent, France, 5.9 percent, Germany, 4.9 percent
and Britain, 4.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Aims for World Cup Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Triple jump world
record-holder Jonathan Edwards of Britain still has a slim chance
of making the World Cup team, according to the Britain's
athletics association on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The European gold medallist said last week he would not jump
again this season after picking up an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
But he was not replaced when the selectors named the men's
team for the one-man per event championship in Johannesburg
between September 11-13.
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan wants to give himself every chance of competing in
South Africa," said British athletics spokeswoman Jayne Pearce.
"We will just have to see what happens."
</P>
<P>
But reigning Commonwealth champion Julian Golley has been
placed on stand-by for the competition.
</P>
<P>
And it would be a major surprise if Edwards is fit enough for
either the World Cup or the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur a
few days later.
</P>
<P>
Two withdrawals were confirmed by the selectors, however.
</P>
<P>
John Mayock and Mark Richardson pulled out of the 1,500m and
4x400m relay respectively, with both opting to concentrate on the
Commonwealth Games instead.
</P>
<P>
Mayock's place goes to Tony Whiteman, who switches from the
3,000m and is replaced by Neil Caddy, while Richardson's berth
will not be filled.
</P>
<P>
The only other change sees European 200m silver medallist Doug
Turner replace Doug Walker, who underwent knee surgery after
winning the Budapest title.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company to Explore Wind-Power Resources in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tang Energy Group, Ltd. of
the United States will invest some 40 million U.S. dollars to
build two wind-power generating fields in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in cooperation with a local
wind-power company.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed recently between the two
companies, the projected wind-power generating fields, each with
an installed capacity of 20,000 kw, will use 600-kw wind-driven
generators developed by the Xinjiang Wind Power Company and
already in use for wind-driven power generation in some areas of
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region abounds in wind-power
resources with nine major wind zones with a combined area of more
than 150,000 sq km. These zones have the potential of producing a
over 800 billion kw/hours of electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Wind Power Company is engaged in high-tech
research, and last year signed a contract with the Jacobs Company
of Germany for the transfer of technology and spare parts to build
600-kw wind-driven generators.
</P>
<P>
The Tang Energy Group is mainly engaged in the petroleum and
natural gas industries. The jointly invested wind-power generating
fields will be the company's first investment project in
wind-power generation.
</P>
<P>
E. Patrick Jenevein III, president of the Texas-based Tang
Energy Group, said there are broad prospects for exploring and
utilizing wind-power resources in Xinjiang with the strong support
of state policies governing wind-power exploration in China.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to build more new wind-power generating fields
in other places in China on the basis of this cooperation with
Xinjiang.

National Tennis Center, battled past promising young American
Corina Morariu 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 today in opening round match at the
U.S. Open tennis championships in New York.
</P>
<P>
Graf broke Morariu on her first two service games and appeared
o her way to an easy victory. But she began to misfire with
unforced errors in the second set and Morariu capitalized with
two breaks to take the set.
</P>
<P>
Graf regrouped in the third rubber, breaking Morariu early for
a 3-0 lead and broke again to go up 5-1. She wound up it out
when Morariu sent a backhand into the net. Graf had 31 winners
but committed 28 unforced errors in the 92 minute battle.
</P>
<P>
Graf missed last year's Open due to surgery and a variety of
ailments. She lost number one ranking during her long layoff and
took a major step in her comeback last week by winning the Pilot
Pen tournament. The victory moved her up to the No. 26. She is
seeded eighth at the Open due to a special exemption from the WTA
Tour,and it is her lowest seeding since 1985.

<HEADLINE> PFA Supports Adams in Book Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Professional
Footballers'Association (PFA) has given its hands to support Tony
Adams over the Arsenal captain's criticism of Glenn Hoddle in his
new book.
</P>
<P>
Adams, former England captain, accused the England coach in
his book of making mistakes during the World Cup and treating the
players"like kids".
</P>
<P>
But PFA deputy chief executive Brendan Batson said Adams was
entitled to give his side of the story -- particularly after
Hoddle had himself published a "kick-and-tell" book.
</P>
<P>
"After Glenn's book it is now open season," said Batson.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that Tony is just expressing his own opinions
and that he has not revealed anything of a confidential nature
between the manager and the players."
</P>
<P>
Former England manager Bobby Robson agreed players and
managers should be allowed to publish books -- but he warned they
should be wary about being too controversial.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Glenn Hoddle has the right to write a book if he
wants," Robson said.
</P>
<P>
"But he must be very careful what he says because he has to
stand or fall on what he writes. The same is true of Tony Adams,"
</P>
<P>
In his book, Addicted, Adams also criticises Hoddle for
picking Alan Shearer ahead of him as captain; humiliating David
Beckham in front of players at training and encouraging Paul
Gascoigne to drink the night before he was axed from the England
squad.
</P>
<P>
Adams also revealed in the book his fight with alcohol and his
spell in prison for drink-driving.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, the publication of the
book would not harm the relationship between Adams and Hoddle,
who is now preparing for a European Championship qualifier
against Sweden on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has already said that whatever appeared in print would
not affect his belief that Adams will remain a key player in the
England set-up for years yet.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not worried about it," insisted Hoddle last week.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association also insisted there is "no
problem"between Hoddle and Adams.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Champion Charges Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A judge has dismissed two
charges of assault against the world boxing champion Herbie Hide
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The case was halted after one of the men who said he had been
attacked failed to appear at Norwich Crown Court to give evidence.
</P>
<P>
Hide, 27, from Norwich, had denied assulting the coaches while
training for a fight in a gym in the city in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Judge David Mellor formally dropped the charges of assault
occasioning actual bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
He ruled that the absence of a key witness would make it
impossible for the Nigerian-born Hide to receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Hide, who claimed he was the victim of a 30,000 Pounds
blackmail plot, said he was "very pleased" with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claimed Hide had attacked Allister Drummond
and Chris Johnson at the Norwich Lads Club after one of them
asked him to turn down the volume on his "ghetto blaster".
</P>
<P>
Hide was sharing the gym with a number of young amateurs who
were under the wing of Drummond and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Hide said he had given Drummond nothing more than a "playful
tap",but Drummond allegedly suffered a leg injury and Johnson an
eye injury.
</P>
<P>
Hide denied assaulting them and claimed Johnson had later
telephoned him and offered to drop the allegations for 30,000
Pounds(about 50,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The call had been taped and was passed to police but a voice
expert was unable to identify the voice on the tape.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a market trader who now lives in Nottingham, failed
to appear for the start of the trial on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The judge was told police attempts to find him had proved
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
Charles Kellett, prosecuting, said the boxer should be tried
only on the alleged attack on Drummond and said seven prosecution
witnesses were available to give evidence.

Drummond, a former amateur lightweight boxer, said afterwards
he felt very let down and added: "I don't think justice has been
done.Herbie Hide will never be a true world champion. He is only
a title holder."
</P>
<P>
In December Hide was given a community service order after
being convicted of using threatening behaviour towards two
Norwich policemen who stopped him in his car.
</P>
<P>
The British Boxing Board of Control warned Hide about his
behaviour after that incident but the board's general secretary,
John Morris, declined to comment on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Tourism to Mainland Increases Despite Economic Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite the overall slump of
Asian tourism, more than 2.1 million people from Taiwan visited
China's mainland in the first half of this year, a year-on-year
increase of 10 percent, according to the Taiwan Travel Quality
Assurance Association.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jinrui, chairman of the association, said the rise was quite
unexpected by Taiwan travel agencies taking into account the
general market conditions.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at a tourism seminar held here recently
by the Guizhou Tourism Bureau and a travel periodical of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan travel agencies who attended the seminar attributed the
growth to improved services of mainland hotels, and more
convenient transportation and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the enhanced promotion by the travel industry in
the central and western regions also helped draw more Taiwanese
tourists.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 million Taiwan people have come to visit the
mainland since home visits were allowed by Taiwan authorities in
1987. In 1997, the number hit a record high of 1.92 million.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Sacks Commercial Airplane Group Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Boeing announced Tuesday
that it had ousted the chief of its commercial airplane operation
who failed to meet the company's expectations.
</P>
<P>
"We have experienced unsatisfactory financial performance with
our commercial airplane operations," Boeing chairman and CEO Phil
Condit said in a statement. "Our expectations are that commercial
airplane operations produce significant, double-digit operating
margins. We conclude there must be significant changes in the
composition of the management team at this time."
</P>
<P>
Ron Woodard, 55, the president of Boeing's beleaguered
Commercial Airplane Group, has been replaced by Alan Mulally, the
53-year-old chief of Boeing's defense and space group.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic move was the first time in recent memory that an
airplane-division president has been removed at the 82-year-old
company.
</P>
<P>
According to Seattle Times, the action comes as Condit faces
tremendous pressure from directors and shareholders angry about
the company's plummeting stock price and weak performance. Despite
a record boom in airplane orders and production rates, the world's
largest aircraft manufacturer reported a loss of 178 million U.S.
dollars last year because of production problems and excessive
costs. Boeing's stock has plummeted by almost 20 dollars a share
from its trading high point in mid-July, costing investors more
than 19.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Woodard joined Boeing in 1966 as a research chemist and was
named president of the Commercial Airplane Group in 1993. He has
been viewed as an aggressive, competitive manager, openly hungry
for risk.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada Tuesday announced a
contribution of 300,000 Canadian dollars (192,000 U.S.dollars) to
the non-governmental organization, Mines Action Canada, to help
sustain its work and activities in the campaign to ban
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
"We are within reach of the 40 ratifications necessary to bring
the Ottawa Convention into legal force. The intensive diplomatic
lobbying for this Convention would have meant little without the
tireless efforts of our partners in the non-governmental
organization community," Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
said in a release.
</P>
<P>
"Mines Action Canada has been a leader in this coalition and I
am pleased to support their active role in the ongoing work needed
to eliminate these deadly weapons," added the Minister.
</P>
<P>
The contribution will be sourced from Canada's
100-million-Canadian-dollar Landmines Fund announced last December
at the international signing conference of the Ottawa Convention.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada, Pilots Continue Talks to Avert Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada and its pilots
continued their last-ditch talks, trying to avert a crippling
strike scheduled at midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Canada's largest airline and its 2,100
pilots gathered in a Toronto hotel Tuesday afternoon to try to
break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are demanding substantial pay increases and improved
working conditions. Air Canada has refused to cave in.
</P>
<P>
A strike at the Montreal-based airline would ground its 166
planes and send many of its 22,000 employees home. It would also
disrupt travelling plans of many Canadians.
</P>
<P>
The airline was reported to be preparing to cancel flights, but
no decisions about cancellations have yet been made by Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It had made arrangements with 15 other air carriers around the
world to take its passengers in the event of a strike, the reports
said.

be forced to pay the cost.

In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris

<HEADLINE> Experts Stress Prevention, Intervention to Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Law enforcement and
criminal justice experts told a U.S. Senate panel Tuesday that
reducing youth violence will require both tough punishment and
prevention and intervention programs.
</P>
<P>
David E. Grossman, presiding administrative judge in Hamilton
County, Ohio, said many courts could do better if they had trained
staff, improved facilities and more resources. Many cannot assess
the youth crime problem in their areas because data isn't
available, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Early intervention. Absolutely," Grossman told the Senate
Judiciary's youth violence subcommittee. "But in order to do that,
we need the resources to accomplish it."
</P>
<P>
Harry Shorstein, a Jacksonville, Florida, state attorney,
advocated a two-pronged approach involving incarceration for
serious teen offenders and early intervention for youngsters
before, and after, they show tendencies of heading toward a life
of crime.
</P>
<P>
Shorstein has assigned prosecutors to each of the 22 middle
schools in his jurisdiction, prosecutes "serious habitual"
juvenile offenders as adults and fights truancy by targeting
parents who don't send their kids to school.
</P>
<P>
"It is not punishment or prevention," said Shorstein, whose
efforts have received national attention. "The answer is
punishment and prevention, early intervention working together."
</P>
<P>
A juvenile crime bill passed by the House of Representatives in
1997 would toughen federal laws dealing with teen crime, including
trying many offenders as adults, and provide strong incentives for
states to do the same. A companion bill, however, has stalled in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jeff Sessions, the Republican chairman of the
subcommittee chairman, said the government spends four billion
dollars a year on prevention programs, some of which aren't
producing results.
</P>
<P>
He said "the most effective way to prevent serious juvenile
crime is to focus on the juvenile who has committed his first
delinquent act."
</P>
<P>
But he also said "the debate we are facing in Congress today is
whether to dedicate any money to juvenile intervention and law
enforcement."

BUCHAREST, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The three-day "People and
Religions" International Ecumenical Meeting ended here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session, Romania's President Emil
Constantinescu noted,"The gathering has demonstrated once more
that the dialogue remains the only efficient way to get us
together, in order to find out what really unites us."
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu stressed that the experience of this dialogue
proves that politics and religion can well gather for the common
good.
</P>
<P>
"In this process of re-establishing the world order, religions
can remind some essential truths we very often neglect: the truth
that life is sacred and the beauty of the human being springs the
most from its fragility; the truth that we cannot complete
ourselves without help from the others," the President added.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the Meeting were more than 800 representatives
of the most important religions of the world.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by Romania's Presidency, the Romanian
Patriarchy and the Sant'Egidio Community.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Russia to Stay on Reform Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Tuesday that Washington will stick with Russians if
they continue on the reform course.
</P>
<P>
"Today's financial crisis does not require you to abandon your
march toward freedom and free markets," Clinton said in a speech
delivered at the Moscow Institute of Foreign Relations, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia must bring to completion the changes it started
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Every choice Russia makes today may have consequences for
years and years to come," Clinton told the Russians, who witnessed
their national currency devaluation, prices shot-up and inflation
soar in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged the Russians not to retreat from their chosen
course.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Russian government to pursue stable revenues
through a healthy taxation system, and to refrain from printing
more money to pay the bills and bail out the banks.
</P>
<P>
He also called for equal treatment in the country's efforts to
help people tide over the difficulties, both to its own citizens
and foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
"The people who loan money into this country must be treated
fairly if you want them to be loaning money into this nation four
years, five years, ten years hence."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the speech, Clinton met with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin in the Kremlin, their first full-scale summit since March
1997.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to have more talks with Yeltsin as well as
leaders of the country's political parties and movements
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite his reiteration of "unconditional support" for Russia,
Clinton did not speak about any specific forms of financial and
economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to leave Russia Thursday and fly on to
Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug to Slow down World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The millennium bug will slow
down significantly the growth of the British and world economy,
UK's NatWest Group warned.
</P>
<P>
NatWest has cut its growth forecast for the UK and the rest of
the world saying that Russia, already buffeted by economic
turmoil, will be among the worst affected by the date transfer
problem.
</P>
<P>
The bug will cut the growth of the UK economy by 0.5 percent
points to 1.9 percent in the year 2000, according to the forecast
by David Kern, chief economist at NatWest's market intelligence
group.
</P>
<P>
The damage of the bug will be more severe in other areas with
growth in Asia, Russia and other former Soviet countries down 0.9
percent and growth in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the
Pacific countries down 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kern warned that if the millennium bug coincided with further
economic downturn in Russia and other developing markets, the
situation could be "much worse than currently envisaged".
</P>
<P>
Although governments and business worldwide are spending
billions to solve the problem, Kern warned that the bug will cause
enough glitches in computer systems, which will result in
inefficiency of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a computer problem, it is a macro-economic
problem as well." he said.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Battered European shares were
pulled in both directions when Wall Street gyrated wildly in its
first hour of business on Tuesday, but as the Dow Jones settled
down, the European bourses managed to regain some ground.
</P>
<P>
London shares recovered in afternoon trading to end just 1.5
percent down, with the FTSE closing down 80.3 points at 5169.1.
But it could have been a lot worse in another volatile day's
trading, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At one point the FTSE index of leading shares had tumbled more
than 170 points as fears grew that the Russian financial crisis
would drag Western economies into recession. But shares recovered
as New York stocks rallied after a dreadful day on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers remain nervous as they digest the implications of the
political and economic crisis that has swept through emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Russian political crisis has deepened since London stocks
were traded last week. The country now goes into its second week
without a government.
</P>
<P>
The Russian concerns and fears that Latin American economies
will be the next to hit Wall Street's Dow Jones were the prime
drag on the FTSE early on, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German share prices fell sharply following a big
drop on Wall Street but rebounded to close higher as the US market
bounced back.
</P>
<P>
With the market turning its attention from Russia to Wall
Street, the blue chip Xetra Dax index was off by nearly 3 percent
in afternoon trading. But it regained ground and closed at
4,855.9, up 44.62 or 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Traders said sharp sell-offs did not materialize as expected
after the Dow Jones Industrial average made its second-largest
point drop ever on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Russia is still present in our minds, but Wall
Street is now the determining factor," Deutsche Bank dealer
Andreas Kehl was quoted by local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the Cac-40 index in Paris see-sawed all day, but
closed only 0.15 percent lower at 3,646.29 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said gains on Wall Street prompted late-session buying
and outweighed concerns about Russia's political and economic
outlook.

<HEADLINE> Greece Toughens Regulations for Taxi Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece waged Tuesday a
stepped-up struggle against increasingly overcharging and poor
service by taxi drivers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Greek Transport and Communications Ministry warned Tuesday that
anyone caught overcharging passengers would have their vehicles
taken off the roads.
</P>
<P>
Minister Tassos Mandelis also sent a letter to prefectural
authorities asking for them to step up checks on taxis and to
implement the measures as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers reportedly might also be grounded and face fines
if they act inappropriately at airport, port and bus and railway
station pick-up points, refuse to take passengers or were
selective in who they pick up.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Consumer Protection Organization (CPO) said it has
received far more calls this year from people complaining about
the services offered, or not offered, by taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
According to the CPO, overcharging, dirty cabs, doubling-up
fares, being selective about routes and destinations were just
some of the most frequently reported complaints.
</P>
<P>
Some 21 taxi drivers have been arrested for overcharging this
year.
