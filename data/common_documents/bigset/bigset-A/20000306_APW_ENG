<HEADLINE> New York primary about to be decided  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With New York's crucial ''Super Tuesday''
primary just hours away, two statewide polls are showing Texas Gov.
George W. Bush ahead of John McCain, but the senator from Arizona
has picked up endorsements from two more major newspapers in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, primary polls are open Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 9
p.m. in New York City, the suburban counties surrounding the city
and in Erie County, which includes Buffalo. In the rest of the
state, primary polls are open from noon to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One poll out Sunday, conducted for the New York Daily News by
Blum &AMP; Weprin Associates, had Bush leading McCain, 47 percent to 39
percent, among likely GOP primary voters with 3 percent supporting
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A second poll, conducted by Zogby International for the New York
Post, had Bush ahead of McCain, 45 percent to 39 percent, among
likely Republican voters with Alan Keyes trailing at 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a third poll out Sunday, conducted by Zogby for the Times
Union of Albany and the Buffalo News, had McCain at 43 percent and
Bush at 40 percent, a statistical tie, with Keyes and Steve Forbes
each at 2 percent. While Forbes has withdrawn from the race, his
delegate slates remain on Tuesday's primary ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between the two Zogby polls is that the Post's
was conducted through Saturday while the one for the two upstate
newspapers went through Friday. The Post's daily tracking poll by
Zogby has been showing movement toward Bush among New York's
Republican voters in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   All three polls showed Vice President Al Gore far ahead of
former Sen. Bill Bradley among New York Democrats. New York's
Tuesday primary is considered a ''must-win'' state for Bradley, a
former Hall of Fame player for the New York Knicks basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   On the newspaper endorsement front, McCain got the nod from both
The New York Times and the Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News editorial called McCain ''a true hero at a time
when America is hungering for heroes.'' The paper said Bush has
been engaged in mud-slinging and that ''John McCain is the best
thing that has happened to the Republican Party since Ronald
Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times said that ''as a zestful insurgent battling to open
his party, Mr. McCain has brought gusts of fresh air, excitement
and common sense to American politics'' while Bush ''has embraced a
punitive hard-right agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times endorsed Gore for the Democratic primary, saying ''he
has a strong internal compass and is more prepared for presidential
responsibility than Mr. Clinton was in 1992 and than Mr. Bradley is
today.'' The Times said ''the voters picked up on Mr. Bradley's
lack of energy and on a certain emotional austerity in his
connection with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Bush has the backing of most of the state's top
Republicans and has Gov. George Pataki running his campaign effort
in the state. Bush could also be helped by the fact that in New
York, GOP voters don't vote directly for the candidates, but for
their proposed convention delegates. Bush's delegate slates are
populated by well-known GOP figures while McCain's are generally
filled with little-known supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, New York has given Bush a real test and is
considered the most competitive of the big states up for grabs on
Tuesday. The Texan is ahead in polls of Ohio and California
Republicans who are also to vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News' telephone poll of 579 likely Republican voters
was conducted Feb. 27-March 3 and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's telephone poll of 433 likely GOP voters was conducted
Feb. 26-March 4 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points. The margin of error among Republican voters
surveyed Feb. 29-March 3 by telephone for the Times Union-Buffalo
News poll was plus or minus 6 percentage points.

Jet Skids Off Runway in California
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A Southwest Airlines 737 jet skidded off the end of a
runway Sunday and onto a nearby street, narrowly missing a gas station. At least
one car was hit by the plane, but it was not immediately clear if there was a
motorist inside, Fox News Channel reported. Three people suffered minor
injuries, said Burbank police Sgt. Scott Wilson. It was not known if they were
part of the flight's crew or passengers. Flight 1455 from Las Vegas to Burbank
carried 137 passengers and five crew. The plane just missed a Chevron station
and skidded to a halt on Hollywood Way, blocking traffic.

Bradley, McCain Fight for Life
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting to stay alive, Republican John McCain Sunday
questioned whether George W. Bush is ''ready for prime time'' and Democrat Bill
Bradley suggested that voters can ''barely tolerate'' Al Gore, as the
presidential nomination races head for a climactic multistate showdown Tuesday.
The two underdogs expressed confidence as they made the TV talk show rounds,
even as aides braced for the worst by quietly making plans for dignified exits.
Bradley advisers acknowledged he has little chance of loosening the vice
president's grip on every ''Super Tuesday'' state. The McCain team held out hope
for an election night surprise.

Poor, Sick in Need of New Benefits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers are bolstering the argument that Medicare
prescription drug benefit should go to the neediest senior citizens, as the
debate over who should be eligible continues. ''There is a core group of elderly
-- those who are poor and those who have chronic illness -- who have the
greatest need for a drug benefit,'' said John K. Inglehart, founding editor of
the policy journal Health Affairs, which published three new studies of
retirees' prescription costs and usage in an issue being released tomorrow. The
findings come as Congress and the Clinton administration wrestle over how best
to help elderly and disabled, who get health insurance under Medicare, pay for
drugs. Medicare provides no reimbursement for most prescriptions.

Boeing Imposing Last Contract Offer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. declared Sunday it will impose its most recent
contract offer on engineers and technical workers whose union has been on strike
against the aerospace giant for three-and-a-half weeks. Employees will be
notified Monday that they will receive the pay increases specified in the
company's Feb. 26 contract offer, officials said. Technical workers will receive
a guaranteed minimum increase of 2 percent, with some workers receiving more.
The total raises are capped at 5.5 percent. For engineers, the company will set
aside salary increases totaling 8 percent this year, with raises being doled out
from the fund on an individual basis.

Bush Planning More Fund-Raisers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush or his surrogates will return to the
fund-raising circuit this month to replenish coffers drained by heavy spending,
his finance chairman said Sunday. Don Evans said the plan all along had been to
raise more money, but acknowledged it was made more necessary because of the
unexpectedly strong challenge mounted by Sen. John McCain. The campaign has
scheduled five fund-raisers for March and April, and is considering five to
seven more, with a goal of raising $5-10 million, said Evans. The events already
scheduled will be in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and Florida.

'American Beauty' Wins WGA Award
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Alan Ball, author of the dark suburban satire
''American Beauty,'' won a top honor from the Writers Guild of America on
Sunday. Ball won for best screenplay based on material written specifically for
the screen. ''American Beauty'' beat out three scripts written by their
directors, ''Magnolia,'' by Paul Thomas Anderson, ''The Sixth Sense,'' by M.
Night Shyamalan, and ''Three Kings'' by David O. Russell. The other nominee was
''Being John Malkovich'' by Charlie Kaufman.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Monday, as the Nikkei Stock Average gained
43.55 points at 19,971.09 points at the end of the morning session. On Friday,
the average closed down 137.57 points. Share prices rose on Wall Street Friday
after the U.S. Labor Department said the economy generated fewer jobs in
February than at any time in the previous nine months, and that the growth of
wages had slowed.

Red Wings Beat Stars 5-3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Sergei Fedorov scored the tiebreaking goal in the second
period and added a short-handed tally 10:01 later to send the Detroit Red Wings
to a 5-3 victory over the Dallas Stars on Sunday night. Goals by Fedorov and Pat
Verbeek in a 1:38 span of the second period helped the Red Wings gain a split of
the four-game season series with the Stars.

<HEADLINE> Bavaria Tries To Deal With Haider  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UEBERSEE, Germany (AP) -- Just north of the Austrian border lies
the German state of Bavaria, a cozy land of quaint villages,
traditional values -- and conservative politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's here that Germans are clamoring most loudly for Europe to
give Austria's new government a chance despite the inclusion of
Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   That may clash with the national government's stand, but it
flows from Bavaria's stout conservatism, which some Germans see as
the first line of defense against the stirrings of an extreme
right, especially at a time when old conservative parties on the
continent are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's rise has caught Germans between neighborly loyalty, an
abiding taboo on Nazi-friendly political rhetoric and an underlying
sympathy for some of his themes.
</P>
<P>
   While European Union governments, including Germany's, have
imposed diplomatic sanctions on Austria because of Haider's past
praise of the Nazis, Bavarians insist their neighbors have a right
to choose their own leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's the problem?'' asked soccer great Franz Beckenbauer, a
Bavarian and one of Germany's most respected public figures.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, it seems, lies less in Haider's tirades against
foreigners and the European Union -- sentiments held by many across
Europe -- than in unrestrained language that would make an outcast
of any mainstream German politician.
</P>
<P>
   He has broken the taboo on Nazi-friendly political rhetoric, to
wit that the Nazis had a ''proper employment policy'' and veterans
of Hitler's Waffen SS were ''decent people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the dumb talk,'' said farmer Klaus Steiner, pausing
between swigs of dark beer and slices of home-smoked bacon at his
comfortable home 25 miles up the autobahn from Austria. ''He
wouldn't stand a chance over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Secure in its conservatism, Germany's southernmost state is the
maverick in Europe's response to Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Countries trying to isolate far-right movements of their own,
such as Belgium and France, have lashed out with particular fury at
Austria for breaking ranks and accepting an alliances between a
mainstream party and the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, the country's French speakers and the three-party
governing coalition worry about the Vlaams Blok party rallying
Dutch speakers behind a populist program. French President Jacques
Chirac, himself a conservative, has been one of the Haider party's
sharpest critics, even though France's ultra-right National Front
has been weakened by infighting.
</P>
<P>
   One reason many conservative Germans shrug their shoulders at
Haider's Freedom Party may be that populism is not foreign to their
own parties, although it's usually couched in the declared aim of
attracting voters into the democratic fold before they drift to the
extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Germany's parliament tightened liberal asylum laws
after a wave of neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners. The Christian
Democrats, the main conservative party outside Bavaria, won a state
election last year on a campaign against easing citizenship
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said while running in 1998
that foreigners who ''abuse their rights as guests'' in Germany
should be kicked out, and his interior minister is considered a
hard-liner on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are strongest in Bavaria. The dominant Christian
Social Union has provided a platform even for firebrands like Peter
Gauweiler, a former state Cabinet member who rallied opposition to
an exhibit on World War II atrocities by German soldiers and who
outraged liberals by suggesting that people with AIDS be
quarantined.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, extreme-right groups have no clout in Bavaria even
though several are based in Munich, the city where Adolf Hitler
launched the Nazi movement.
</P>
<P>
   The state's governor, Edmund Stoiber, says Bavaria has an
obligation to defuse the confrontation between the rest of the EU
and Austria -- a country with which Bavaria shares a lot, from
commerce and a deep Roman Catholic tradition to an affinity for
oompah bands.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Stoiber has drawn the line at meeting with Haider,
rebuking some local Christian Social Union leaders who said they
would.
</P>
<P>
   But in bastions of Alpine conservatism such as Berchtesgaden, a
picture-postcard town where older residents still remember Hitler
driving through en route to his mountaintop retreat, Europe's snub
of Haider is viewed critically.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Germans and French can vote for whomever they want, why not
the Austrians?'' asked retiree Walburga Riedl, 78. ''Would I vote
for Haider? Well, why not?''

<HEADLINE> Cheers and boos as Hillary Clinton marches in St. Patrick's parade  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton left the comfort of a
friendly church for an early St. Patrick's Day parade at which she
was both cheered and booed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went from Riverside Church in Manhattan, where she was
repeatedly applauded for calling for better police-community
relations, to a parade in Woodside, Queens, where she was
alternately heckled and admired.
</P>
<P>
   The uncontrollable nature of the parade crowd stood in stark
contrast to many other Clinton campaign events, which tend to
feature Democratic Party members or other supportive audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go back to Arkansas, carpetbagger!'' called out Bernie
Mulligan, of Queens, who works for a cable TV company.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McEvoy, a legal secretary who was one of a group of
hecklers that followed Clinton along the route, said: ''She's a
liar and a cheat and a carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the president, McEvoy added: ''If she had any
decency she'd have left him.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the onlookers, some of them holding signs saying
''Irish-Americans for Hillary,'' clapped and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's got my vote,'' said Marge Toner, who was wearing a green
sweater with shamrocks on it. ''She's willing to push for health
insurance, and she's a little more open to other points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's great -- a woman, a strong woman. She knows the
politics,'' said Susan DiScala.
</P>
<P>
   With a green scarf tucked into her coat, the first lady smiled,
waved and posed for pictures as she marched seven blocks with a
group of Democrats, including City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Public
Advocate Mark Green, City Council President Peter Vallone and U.S.
Reps. Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she were enjoying the march, Clinton said: ''I sure am.
How could you not? It's a glorious day with a lot of happy
people.''
</P>
<P>
   She ignored the jeers that occasionally emanated from the
several thousand people scattered along the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   The event was billed as the first local inclusive St. Patrick's
Day parade because it allowed gay organizations to participate.
Among them were Lavender and Green, a gay Irish group that had
about two dozen members walking a half-block behind the first lady.
They also received an occasional boo, but one of them, Barbara
Moore, said: ''Hate is not going to win today.''
</P>
<P>
   The main St. Patrick's Day parade, held March 17 on Fifth
Avenue, excludes the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization on the
grounds that the event is run by a Catholic fraternal group, the
Ancient Order of Hibernians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Sunday she hoped the main parade would be
inclusive. But even if it's not, she said, she'll attend the March
17 event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm marching,'' she said with a firm nod.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday in a speech at Riverside Church in Manhattan, the
first lady chastised city officials for refusing to acknowledge
problems with the police force in the aftermath of the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leadership in this city refuses to reach out to work with
a community in pain or even acknowledge that there is a problem,''
she told 3,000 worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a remark President Clinton made Friday, she said some
city residents believe that if Amadou Diallo ''had been a young
white man in an all-white neighborhood, he would still be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, an unarmed black African immigrant, was shot to death
last year by four white officers. The cops were acquitted of murder
about two weeks ago, sparking protests led by activist the Rev. Al
Sharpton and others.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, spokesman for Clinton's Republican rival for
the U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said that ''with the
Clintons, politics motivates everything, and nothing they do
happens accidentally, so it's no coincidence that President
Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and Al Sharpton all chose to read off the
same script regarding the Diallo case.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals Clinton made to improve local policing were:
</P>
<P>
   --Better pay for cops.
</P>
<P>
   --A youth academy modeled on the Reserve Officers Training Corps
to attract minority high school students to the New York Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   --More funding for production of a high-tech gun scanner that
would scan not just for metal but for the shape of a gun. The
scanners are being developed by the U.S. Departments of Defense and
Justice and by private companies around the country, including one
upstate in the Utica-Rome area. Police thought Diallo had a gun
when he pulled out his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also commended two precincts in the South Bronx for
reducing both crime and civilian complaints through better
training, mentoring for new cops and holding officers accountable
for complaints against them.

<HEADLINE> Report: School Riot Treated Harshly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- People arrested in riots following
Michigan State University's loss in last year's NCAA basketball
tournament were jailed at a rate higher than national figures for
rapists and robbers, The Detroit News reported.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130 people -- the majority of them college students
with no criminal records -- were arrested after the March 27-28
riots, the newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 113 people convicted paid more than $300,000 in restitution
and served a total of eight years behind bars, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the strictest enforcement that I have heard of,'' said
Sheldon Steinbach, general council for the American Council on
Education, who has studied riots at campuses nationwide. ''The town
and the institution were making a very clear point that this is not
going to be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of those convicted -- from people who looted and burned a
police car to a student caught roasting a hot dog over an illegal
bonfire -- 94 went to jail. That 83 percent incarceration rate is
higher than the 70 percent for first-time offender rapists and 55
percent for first-time offender robbers put behind bars nationally,
according to statistics from the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   And of those convicted nationally of public order crimes, which
would include rioting and alcohol offenses, only 22 percent went to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they could have hit me any harder,'' said David
Jirikovic, who spent two weeks in jail and was ordered to pay
$5,000 in restitution for standing atop an overturned car. ''I am
not a bad person. The costs of my five seconds of stupidity are far
overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said that was the
typical argument of those arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every one of these kids made the same argument in court:
Here's Junior, from a good family, he's never been in trouble, who
had a little too much to drink and got carried away in the
moment,'' he said. ''I'm not trying to ruin these kids' futures.
But they have to understand that their actions were not
excusable.''

<HEADLINE> Sex Charges Against 'Hero' Reduced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AP) -- Two of several sexual misconduct
charges against an Air Force rescue hero were reduced by a military
judge after defense lawyers argued that prosecution witnesses
failed to support the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bulk of the charges against Col. James A. Sills
still stand, including allegations he molested two underage girls
numerous times. His court-martial heads into its second week today.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Col. Bruce Brown, on Saturday removed certain
specifications surrounding a charge of sodomy through oral sex as
well as language that had increased the severity of an indecent
conduct charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sills, a 25-year veteran, shared the 1994 MacKay Trophy for the
most meritorious Air Force flight of the year. He commanded two
helicopters that rescued six sailors who abandoned their ship in
stormy weather off Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Sills, 48, plans to testify and may take the stand today. During
his opening statement last week, defense lawyer Drew Pinkerton said
Sills will deny the charges and will testify that one of the
alleged victims twice unexpectedly kissed him.

<HEADLINE> New Challenges in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- For Mozambicans who managed to survive
vicious flooding and days stranded in trees and on rooftops to make
it to an aid camp, there was a new challenge: Getting food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   As floodwaters in the swollen Limpopo and Save rivers receded,
relief efforts shifted Sunday from plucking survivors from harm's
way to dispensing aid to hundreds of thousands of desperate
survivors, said Brenda Barton, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World
Food Program. Many survivors were still only accessible by air.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said they expected the death toll from the disaster
to soar into the thousands as water levels dropped and revealed the
mud-covered remains of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenous and thirsty after being trapped for up to a week as
floodwaters rose around them, survivors have scrambled for food and
clean water, sometimes fighting as aid workers struggled to
distribute emergency supplies to them.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven helicopters and 15 planes delivered aid on Sunday,
mostly in the Limpopo River valley, 125 miles northeast of the
capital, Maputo, Barton said. Another two helicopters were ferrying
stranded people to aid camps.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 250,000 people were crowded into 64 ill-equipped
camps, mostly in southern and central Mozambique. Aid workers
reported they were running out of clean water, increasing the risk
of cholera outbreaks. Malaria cases were said to have tripled.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. envoy Ross Mountain said many survivors were ignoring the
pleas of aid workers and government officials and returning to
flood-battered areas, raising the possibility they may need to be
rescued again if heavy rains and flooding resume.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of Cyclone Gloria, which together with a steady,
two-week downpour caused the deluge, was downgraded to a tropical
storm. The storm hovered over the Indian Ocean off the coast of
Mozambique on Sunday and was expected to bring more rain.
</P>
<P>
   President Joaquim Chissano said people affected by the floods
would need to be fed for at least 10 months -- until they could grow
new crops. He also said a minimum of $250 million would be needed
for reconstruction and pleaded with Mozambique's creditors to
forgive the country's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Trivedy, of the British charity Save the Children, said
relief was finally starting to reach the Save River valley, 625
miles north of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   Water levels in the river had diminished, alleviating the
immediate danger of drowning. Still, an estimated 15,000 people
were in urgent need of aid, and French, German and U.N. planes were
delivering relief supplies to the previously neglected area on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trivedy said 5,000 famished people had gathered next to a church
in the coastal town of Nova Mambone. Between 4,000 and 5,000 more
were requesting food at a church mission farther inland, while
1,600 had made their way to aid camps, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more emergency aid was streaming into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two U.S. airmen arrived at Hoedspruit air base Sunday to
set up aid operations for up to 600 American troops.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 69 British boat crews began flying to the
central town of Beira to help deliver aid to flood survivors in the
Save River valley.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen crew members and four rescue boats from Florida were
expected to start delivering aid today in the Limpopo River valley.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala-Belize Dispute Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELCHOR DE MENCOS, Guatemala (AP) -- The villages here have names
like Winds of Sand and Pasture of Flowers. Horses, roosters and an
occasional pig wander lazily along the only road as it meanders
through the picturesque mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the obvious backdrop for an international conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But with the recent revival of a century-old territorial dispute
between Belize and Guatemala, the sleepy border between the two
countries has become the center of one of the most intense
international disputes in Central America since the civil wars of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It began last fall, when Belize's border police killed two
Guatemalan peasants. Then it was fanned Feb. 24 when Guatemala
arrested three soldiers and a police officer from Belize who had
crossed the often indistinguishable border carrying dozens of
machine guns and pistols. They were released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala City, soldiers have guarded Belize's embassy after
a bomb was discovered last week under a car parked nearby. And in
Belize City, soldiers guard Guatemala's embassy in case the
frequent anti-Guatemalan demonstrations there get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Said Musa, Belize's prime minister, claims the military
contingent facing illegal weapons charges never crossed the border
and was illegally stopped in Belize's territory.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the dispute heats up between officials from the two
nations, people who live here say things have never been more
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''These rumors about soldiers from here or soldiers from there
sneaking around the border is a lie,'' said Ruben Pita, an exporter
who lives and works in Melchor de Mencos, a tiny village on the
Guatemalan side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   At Melchor's border station, one of only two major crossing
points along the 135-mile border, backpackers clad in shorts and
sandals outnumber border guards. Soldiers from either nation are
nowhere in sight. The border is mostly unmarked, save for the
occasional metal gate.
</P>
<P>
   But in nearby Santa Elena, Guatemala, where the four prisoners
were held, officials from Belize weren't quite as nonchalant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hoping this won't strain relations in any way, but we
also know that these men did nothing wrong,'' said Eamon H.
Courtenay, a trade ambassador from Belize's embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Areualol, head of Guatemala's military forces for the
border state of Peten, said the arrests were necessary to protect
the rights of Guatemalans who may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are already doing everything to stop the Belizean
progression into Guatemalan territory and to stop their disregard
for the rights of our citizens,'' he said. ''The arrests are an
important part of those actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests may have been in retaliation for two Guatemalan
citizens killed by Belize's border officials in the past nine
months. Guatemala says the two men were simple laborers who were
minding their own business. Belize says one was a drug dealer who
attacked police and that an investigation into the slaying of the
other cleared their officials of all wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   With the deaths and the arrests, a quick solution to the
conflict seems unlikely. These two nations have been down the road
of conflict before, never resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Guatemala pondered declaring war on Belize -- which was
still a British colony -- claiming the whole nation constituted
Guatemalan territory lost in 1850 in a vain attempt by Britain and
the United States to divide former colonies in the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that British soldiers were going nowhere,
all talk of war was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions again ran high with Belize's independence in 1982.
Guatemalan authorities claimed the British had mistakenly awarded
4,600 square miles of territory to Belize when drawing up the new
nation's borders.
</P>
<P>
   In what officials here say was a 1992 sign of good will,
Guatemala agreed to recognize Belize's borders.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, officials on both sides are continuing to sing the
praises of peace and of maintaining the tranquility of places like
Melchor de Mencos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is too laid back here for any real threat of anything
happening,'' said Marc Sandoval, a truck driver from across the
border in Belize.

<HEADLINE> Encyclopedia and Web site trace history, culture of blacks  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some news from the virtual grapevine: The work
that black slaves did in America would be worth more than $1
trillion in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one fact flying through cyberspace on a new Web site
-- Africana.com -- which aims to be a live forum linking blacks
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grapevine is of huge importance to the black community,
since historically we were excluded from the mainstream media,''
says Henry Louis Gates Jr., the site's cofounder and head of
Harvard University's African-American studies department.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Web site with black content is the new place to 'hang
out,''' he says. ''It's a talking drum for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Africana.com is an educational portal that offers a black
perspective on everything from the daily news, history and the arts
to practical advice -- like how to make it in business or manage
your hair.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can share views, and differences, in online
discussions, sign up for free e-mail or buy books and music. And
they can listen to 80 radio stations in places from Benin in
Africa, and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't advocate anything, we don't tell you how to be
black,'' says Gates. ''We want to help raise a healthy black
community, by addressing concerns about health, wealth, love.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched to accompany a new 2,095-page book called
Africana -- billed as the most complete record of Africa and the
black diaspora in one volume. A parallel CD-ROM is called Encarta
Africana.
</P>
<P>
   The book realizes the dream of civil rights pioneer W.E.B.
DuBois, himself a Harvard alumnus. By the time he died in Ghana in
1963, he had sketched the beginnings of the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gates came along, equipped with a brainy Rolodex, the
Internet and millions of dollars in capital.
</P>
<P>
   He is a practical dreamer: The company that runs the Web site is
for-profit. Its president, Darrol Roberts, is a marketing expert
who once worked for Reebok. With Gates' help, he hopes to raise $15
million this year from investors and keep the site
advertising-free. However, sponsors are promised online
acknowledgment and items sold on the Web contribute to profits.
</P>
<P>
   High-power and high-tech, the project is a far throw from
ancient Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' chief business partners are a fellow Harvard professor,
Ghanaian-born philosopher Kwami Anthony Appiah, and Harry Lasker
III, a designer of educational media who helped create ''Sesame
Street.'' Music mogul Quincy Jones chipped in money, too. (By the
way, the encyclopedia reveals, his middle name is Delight.)
</P>
<P>
   The need for a special ''black'' Web site points to a new racial
problem linked to the Internet -- failure of blacks to match whites
in digital literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Among America's 35 million blacks, far fewer households use the
Internet than the general population -- about 11 percent compared to
26 percent in general, according to Commerce Department figures.
And the 700 million blacks in Africa presumably have even less
access.
</P>
<P>
   With Africana.com, ''we want the black content to inspire people
to log on and learn,'' says Roberts. ''We want to be a digital
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Africana.com is in the process of hiring 50 people to staff its
offices in Cambridge, Mass. Their goal reaches beyond the Internet
-- to try to close the gap between America's plugged-in blacks and
those with meager financial and educational resources.
</P>
<P>
   With that aim, the site offers free lesson plans for teachers
based on entries from the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons will go to schools ''with white kids and yellow kids
and brown kids and black kids and change the landscape of what they
take for granted about how the world works,'' says Appiah.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of encyclopedias and CD-ROMS have been donated to
schools across the United States through individual and corporate
grants. And a copy of the printed encyclopedia will be donated to
every library in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Africana also will tap traditional black markets by setting up
sites in churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   ''Black people meet more in churches than anyplace else, as a
group,'' says Gates, ''And there, you'll have a minister saying,
'This is important to you, your future, your economic life, your
children. We know you've got a big 36-inch television. Now get a
little computer.'''
</P>
<P>
   With his presence on television and the media, Gates' star power
has drawn a lineup of expert commentators like Nobel Prize-winning
Nigerian novelist Wole Soyinka; Benjamin Carson, a Johns Hopkins
Hospital neurosurgeon and innovator in separating Siamese twins;
feminist critic Bell Hooks; and personal trainer Roberta Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, a 49-year-old academic who grew up in a West Virginia
working-class family, also has drawn the disdain of some of the
black intelligentsia -- as an elitist whose Harvard department once
was dubbed the ''Cotton Club on the Charles'' by the Rev. Eugene
Rivers, a Boston-based activist.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has now signed up as a commentator on the Web site. And a
Boston court is sentencing troubled youth to attend a pilot
Africana program in Rivers' church.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Africana.com is both highbrow and popular.
</P>
<P>
   It spotlights public figures from 18th century
inventor-astronomer Benjamin Banneker to today's athletes and
rappers, offers advice on daily concerns from health and careers to
fashion, cooking and parenthood, and displays art from historically
black colleges in an online ''gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Both site and encyclopedia span Africa-rooted cultures in the
Americas, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. Topics range from ancient
African kingdoms to the continent's modern dictatorships, from a
17th century Brazilian state created by runaway slaves to
contemporary black Jews in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gates was surprised by some of what he learned: ''Many of
the pallbearers in Peru are black people. I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to slavery, there's no mincing words: African
blacks helped sell and ship slaves to America and other parts of
the world, according to the Web site. It also posts a scathing
attack on Gates for mentioning this fact in a public television
program. Gates responds online.
</P>
<P>
   Another entry touts the best-selling book ''The Debt: What
America Owes to Blacks,'' by activist attorney Randall Robinson,
who calculated the $1.4 trillion figure as the total value of slave
labor.
</P>
<P>
   A year old, Africana.com claims a half million ''hits'' a month.
Still, it has some strong black-centric competition, including
BlackVoices.com, known for its chat groups and job referrals and
owned by the powerful Tribune Co., and NetNoir.com, heavy with
celebrity interviews and partly owned by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   But the weighty printed encyclopedia, despite some errors in its
first edition and a list price of $100 -- often discounted -- has
little competition in bookstores for the sheer amount and range of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Co-edited by Appiah and Gates, the entries are signed by 220
contributors, and balanced is sought on controversial topics. For
instance, the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan is described as an
African-American religious leader who advocates black
self-sufficiency but has been criticized for ''anti-Semitic
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important to us that the heart of this is telling
the truth, and it's not just cheerleading,'' says Appiah. ''The
truth includes the 10 million AIDS orphans in Africa -- and
Farrakhan.''

<HEADLINE> A Legacy of Spies in Washington  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A mole inside the CIA. A bug embedded in the
woodwork of the State Department. A Cuban diplomat expelled for
allegedly receiving classified information.
</P>
<P>
   The game of spying, which hardly cooled after the Cold War
ended, appears to be in no danger of taking a breather in the
American capital.
</P>
<P>
   It has a long and circuitous history.
</P>
<P>
   Late on an oppressively hot August evening in 1814, a red-coated
officer pounded on the door of the boarding house run by Barbara
Suter a block from the White House. The surprise visitor was Gen.
Edmund Ross, commander of the invading British troops engaged in
burning much of the city. He demanded that dinner be prepared for
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the landlady suggested he go elsewhere, the general
smilingly made clear that he had not come to Mrs. Suter's by
chance, that he knew all about her ability as a cook and the merits
of her establishment in clear view of the executive mansion and
nearby government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ross pointedly reminded her about a man in shabby civilian
clothes who had begged a meal at noontime a few days before,
explaining his English accent by saying he was a British deserter.
</P>
<P>
   The general knew not only that Mrs. Suter had fed the stranger,
but also that a paying guest had warned against taking him in,
saying there were so many vagrants in the city some must surely be
spies.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Suter faced the genial British general, the source of
his detailed information became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Spying out an enemy's home country, seeking the advantage that
good intelligence can bring, has been a human pursuit since long
before the nation was born.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington, as commander in chief of the Continental
Army, used spies to good effect, instructing a staff officer to
''exert your best endeavors to obtain every useful intelligence you
possibly can of the enemy's motions by sea and land.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He understood the value of intercepted letters, accounts from
POWs and deserters ...,'' Pamela Kessler wrote in her 1992 tour of
the capital's spy habitats, ''Undercover Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of Washington's career as a spymaster, a bronze statue
of Nathan Hale, awaiting execution as a spy, stands outside the
Justice Department. It's a reminder of the sacrifice often demanded
of spies, and a reminder of the days when part of the building was
occupied by the FBI, the nation's official spy hunter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the FBI that tracked down Aldrich Ames as the mole inside
the CIA, discovered a Russian diplomat with electronic
eavesdropping equipment outside the State Department and
investigated the Cuban diplomat accused of receiving classified
data from a U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the Civil War, clouds of spies arose like swamp
gas.
</P>
<P>
   On the Union side, the intelligence network organized for the
Army of the Potomac by famed private detective Allan Pinkerton
resembled a snake biting its own tail.
</P>
<P>
   The short, bearded Pinkerton, who went by the name Maj. E. J.
Allen, took over army intelligence for Gen. George McClellan.
Pinkerton and his energetic agents proceeded to inflate the badly
outnumbered Confederate army into an invincible force, all by their
own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''All in all they ... perfected a genuinely remarkable system
for getting forbidden information out of Richmond,'' extracting it
from POWs, escaped slaves, ''loyal'' Southerners, deserters and
from observations by Union scouts, Bruce Catton wrote in his 1962
trilogy, ''Mr. Lincoln's War.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the detective misinterpreted his data and
warned the general he was facing Confederate forces twice as large
as they actually were.
</P>
<P>
   The flawed intelligence gave the super-cautious McClellan all
the excuse he needed to avoid action against weaker forces, opening
himself to attack as a do-nothing general.
</P>
<P>
   On the Confederate side, one secret agent, dressed as a Union
Army chaplain, watched President Lincoln's movements from a vantage
point in Lafayette Square across from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Another rebel, Rosa Greenhow, a popular Washington hostess,
pumped her important guests for information and sent ciphered
dispatches across the lines. One message, warning of a federal
strike into Virginia early in the war, may have played a role in
the Confederate victory at the first battle of Manassas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Army Will Limit Overseas Duty  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is setting a six-month limit on
deployment of both active-duty and reserve units sent overseas on
temporary assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Guard and Army Reserve currently are
deployed abroad for up to nine months, the maximum allowed by
federal law. Active-duty units normally rotate after six months,
but the service has set no official time limit until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, will formally
disclose the policy Tuesday during a ceremony in Bosnia at which
the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard will take
command of U.S. peacekeeping operations from the 10th Mountain
Division, a regular Army unit, a spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the significance of the new policy for the
reservists, Maj. Gen. Roger C. Schultz, director of the Army
National Guard, and Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Plewes, chief of the Army
Reserve, will join Shinseki for the announcement, said the
spokesman, Col. Edwin Veiga.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting overseas duty to six months is meant to ease the burden
of long deployments on soldiers, their families and, in the case of
guardsmen and reservists, their regular employers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, as the active-duty force has
shrunk by more than one-third, the National Guard and Reserve have
been called upon more regularly to support not only combat
operations but also peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Except when they are called for overseas duty, reservists are
obligated to serve in uniform only one weekend a month and two
weeks each summer. Reservists now are serving in three major
overseas operations: peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, in
the Balkans and in the Persian Gulf area, where pilots are
patrolling the skies of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's six-month limit on overseas deployments will apply
only to missions other than war, Veiga said. In the event of war,
the Army could keep National Guard and Reserve units overseas for
up to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   And for active-duty personnel, it applies only those in units
assigned to non-permanent deployments -- such as peacekeeping and
other temporary missions -- as opposed to long-term Army commitments
in places like Germany and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy brings the Army more in line with the other
services. The Air Force generally keeps its reserve units abroad
for no more than three months. The Navy and Marine Corps do not
deploy as many reservists in peacetime as the Army and Air Force,
but the Navy as a matter of policy keeps its sailors at sea for no
more than six months at a time.

<HEADLINE> The shunnin' of the Irish gays and lesbians  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's like deja O'vu.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization wanted to march up Fifth
Avenue in the annual St. Patrick Day Parade -- again.
</P>
<P>
   Parade organizers refused to grant them a permit -- again.
</P>
<P>
   The gay activists went to court and lost -- again, the eighth
straight year of failed efforts to infiltrate the nation's oldest
and largest celebration of Irish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the ILGO members have already vowed to try again next
year -- but only after protesting (again) on March 17, with an
expected 2,000 demonstrators flooding Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   There may be peace in Northern Ireland before this Manhattan
battle is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The parade's organizers, the Ancient Order of Hibernians,
promise their opposition to ILGO is unwavering. But it's not just
ILGO that raises the Hibernians' Irish; Ernest Mathews, attorney
for the group, insists that the ancient order is simply determined
to keep the focus on Irish-Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hibernians would object if Snow White and the Seven
Dwarves marched,'' Mathews vows. It's a good analogy: the
decade-long fight has left ILGO members grumpy, parade organizers
happy, and many others a bit sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's edition of the parade is its 239th, this St.
Patrick's Day tradition began in 1991 when the recently formed ILGO
first petitioned to march under its own banner. The group had
formed a year earlier, providing a meeting place for the city's gay
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   The application drew instant, overwhelming attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had everything: politics, religion, sex,'' recalls Anne
Maguire, a charter ILGO member.
</P>
<P>
   Which meant nothing to the Hibernians, who quickly griped that
the Catholic Church's opposition to homosexuality meant the gays
were unwelcome in the parade. A deal was brokered that allowed ILGO
to march, but not as the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were sponsored by a local Irish-American group.
When March 17 arrived, all hell broke loose.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very ugly,'' remembers ex-mayor David Dinkins, who
accompanied 35 ILGO members along the 2{-mile parade route. ''It
was reminiscent of some of the incidents in the Deep South during
the civil rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Full cans of beer were thrown at the marchers, while spectators
sprayed beer and spewed venom at the group. Police guarding Dinkins
opened umbrellas to protect the mayor from the sudsy fusillade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was terrifying, and it was really moving in a lot of ways,
and totally surreal,'' says Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the gays were out of the parade -- but they were
allowed to stage a pre-parade march on the parade route. The next
year, they were not allowed to march at all -- a situation that
remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   This year's banishment was sealed exactly one month before the
festivities, when a federal jury ruled that the city had not
violated ILGO's civil rights by refusing their bid to hold a march
prior to the parade.
</P>
<P>
   While ILGO was disappointed with the jury verdict, the decision
did nothing to change the group's annual plans.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before the actual parade steps off, some 2,000 members
and supporters of ILGO plan to fill Fifth Avenue at 59th Street.
Dozens of gay activists from Ireland are flying over to
participate; some members of original ''ILGO 35'' are planning a
St. Patrick's Day reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Why do this again?
</P>
<P>
   ''Their decision to keep us out is based on bigotry against
lesbians and gay men who are open,'' Maguire says. ''So I think
it's just as important now as it was in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   While ILGO refuses to disappear, its numbers are dwindling.
Active membership has dropped from about 50 to less than 10, while
its mailing list is about half of its peak of 400.
</P>
<P>
   But it still wields some political and media clout. When U.S.
Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton announced plans to march in
this year's parade, ILGO ripped the first lady for her
insensitivity to their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who marched at an all-inclusive St. Patrick's Day
Parade in Queens on Sunday, said she will join in the Manhattan
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   While ILGO fights its losing battle in Manhattan, gay
contingents are now permitted to march at parades in Seattle, San
Francisco, and Cambridge, Mass., as well as in cities across
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the irony,'' Maguire says with a wry grin. ''Most of us
came to New York because it was so oppressive in Ireland. And then
they're marching in Cork. They're marching in Dublin and Galway,
and in Belfast, Limerick and Derry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Totally ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   ILGO, despite its repeated losses in court and the endless
rebuffs from the Hibernians, says it will be back next year in an
effort to join the parade -- again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a tradition now,'' says Maguire. ''We're just as
much a part of the day as anything in the parade. You can't mention
the parade without mentioning us.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe one year they'll think, 'OK, let's give in and get it
over with.'''

<HEADLINE> Rappers take on police brutality in new recording package  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The subject of Mos Def's letter to the hip-hop
community was simple -- 41 bullets. Forty-one shots fired by four
white officers at an unarmed black man in the Bronx, 41 shots that
sparked weeks of protests.
</P>
<P>
   The anger at the death of Amadou Diallo got the rapper thinking
-- about Diallo, about police brutality, about the feeling by many
blacks and Latinos that they are police targets. And about what he
and his fellow artists could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   The result, a multi-song project against police brutality called
''Hip-hop for Respect,'' is due out in late March on Rawkus Records
-- with the profits going to organizations that fight police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The project is being completed after a jury in Albany on Feb. 25
found the four white officers innocent of all charges in Diallo's
killing. Defense attorneys argued their clients fired because they
thought the young African immigrant had pulled a gun out of his
pocket; it turned out to have been a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   But Mos, who is known for a socially conscious hip-hop, wrote
his letter almost a year ago, just weeks after Diallo's killing in
February 1999, to ask fellow rappers to join the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for
them,'' the letter said. ''Now I'm askin' you and anybody who looks
on this letter to come forward and show your heart ... to love the
people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices
that they suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did come forward -- from MTV-known rappers like the
Wu-Tang Clan's Cappadonna and Flip Mode Squad's Rah Digga to
hip-hop legends like Kool G. Rap and De La Soul's Maseo.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 rappers spent a couple of days last April spitting
lyrics for the ''Hip-hop for Respect'' project. Four songs -- ''1 4
Love,'' ''Protective Custody,'' ''Shade Never Knows,'' and ''1 4
Love, part 2'' -- are to be released by Rawkus on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   While Diallo's death was the catalyst for the project and is the
subject for many of the verses, the larger focus is police
brutality, said Mos' partner, Talib Kweli.
</P>
<P>
   ''I compare it to a town hall meeting where artists in our
generation get to air what they feel about it,'' he said. ''It's
just something that needs to be heard. It's not about saying, 'Oh
please stop.' It's about respecting ourselves enough to say ...
we're not going to allow ourselves to be treated like this.''
</P>
<P>
   From Shabaam Sahdeeq: ''Too many of my guys have become moments
of silence/ Laws take lives and condone it through sirens and
nightsticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Common raps, ''Yo, you wanna know how to improve on the quality
of life/ Try respectin' it, step in my zone with that madness and
I'm checking it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As people we have to stand up,'' Posdnuos from De La Soul said
at a video taping for ''1 4 Love,'' which took place at a Queens
shooting range. ''Hopefully it can make people aware of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City crime rates have fallen dramatically during Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's administration. Civil liberties advocates argue
that the fight against crime has led to police brutality directed
at minority communities, but city officials and many other people
maintain the police are doing their best at a very difficult job.
</P>
<P>
   Mos said those who refuse to recognize the existence of police
brutality do so at their own risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very foolish attitude for folks to have, to think
... it doesn't affect them,'' he said. ''It may not affect them
today, it may not affect them next month ... but you can expect the
consequence of that type of activity to arrive on everybody's
doorstep at some point or another.''
</P>
<P>
   The project follows other hip-hop collectives that spoke out
against violence and gang warfare, ''Self-Destruction'' from Stop
the Violence in 1988 and ''We're All in the Same Gang'' by The West
Coast Rap All-Stars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when mainstream hip-hop is dominated by images of
materialism and fast living, a cause like this is welcome, said
King Kirk of the Sporty Thievz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hip-hop is missing a message right now,'' he said. ''This is
something, it's for a real cause. ... It can make everybody look at
the subject more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   King Kirk said hip-hop artists would be lying to their fans by
not exploring difficult issues like police brutality, and Kweli
said this would be especially harmful to young people who make up
much of the rap audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hip-hop is the only thing these children are listening to,''
he said. ''If you claim to represent people, you have to really
represent them.''

New Challenges in Mozambique
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- For Mozambicans who managed to survive vicious
flooding and days stranded in trees and on rooftops to make it to an aid camp,
there was a new challenge: Getting food and water. As floodwaters in the swollen
Limpopo and Save rivers receded, relief efforts shifted Sunday from plucking
survivors from harm's way to dispensing aid to hundreds of thousands of
desperate survivors, said Brenda Barton, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food
Program. Many survivors were still only accessible by air. Aid workers said they
expected the death toll from the disaster to soar into the thousands as water
levels dropped and revealed the mud-covered remains of the dead.

   RADFORD, Va. (AP) -- A fiery blast rocked an automobile parts manufacturing
plant Sunday night, injuring seven workers. Several others were still missing,
authorities said. ''It's my understanding that there are fatalities,'' said a
dispatcher at the local fire department. The dispatcher, who declined to give
his name, said he didn't know how many workers were unaccounted for. Dogs were
sent into the soot-covered rubble of the New River Castings plant to look for
the missing employees.

Jet Skids Off Runway in California

   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A Southwest Airlines 737 jet skidded off the end of a
runway Sunday and onto a nearby street, hitting at least one car. It was not
immediately clear if there was a motorist inside the car, Fox News Channel
reported. Three people suffered minor injuries, said Burbank police Sgt. Scott
Wilson. Louis Diaz, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration, said
the injured were a pilot, co-pilot and passenger. Flight 1455 from Las Vegas to
Burbank carried 137 passengers and five crew. The plane just missed a Chevron

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain ruled out running as a third-party
candidate, and both he and Democrat Bill Bradley said Sunday that they could
support their rivals in defeat, as the presidential nomination races ahead for a
climactic multistate showdown Tuesday. They expressed confidence as they made
the TV talk show rounds, even as aides braced for the worst by quietly making
plans for dignified exits. Bradley advisers acknowledged he has little chance of
loosening the vice president's grip on every ''Super Tuesday'' state. The McCain
team held out hope for an election night surprise.

Poor, Sick in Need of New Benefits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers are bolstering the argument that Medicare
prescription drug benefits should go to the neediest senior citizens, as the
debate over who should be eligible continues. ''There is a core group of elderly
-- those who are poor and those who have chronic illness -- who have the
greatest need for a drug benefit,'' said John K. Inglehart, founding editor of
the policy journal Health Affairs, which published three new studies of
retirees' prescription costs and usage in an issue being released Monday. The
findings come as Congress and the Clinton administration wrestle over how best
to help elderly and disabled, who get health insurance under Medicare, pay for
drugs. Medicare provides no reimbursement for most prescriptions.

against the aerospace giant for three-and-a-half weeks. Employees will be
notified Monday that they will receive the pay increases specified in the
company's Feb. 26 contract offer, officials said. Technical workers will receive
a guaranteed minimum increase of 2 percent, with some workers receiving more.
The total raises are capped at 5.5 percent. For engineers, the company will set
aside salary increases totaling 8 percent this year, with raises being doled out
from the fund on an individual basis.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Keeps Execution Time  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY ESTES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Standing in a small, cinderblock room
and an adjoining hallway, the witnesses have braved the evening
chill to watch the inmate strapped into the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Last goodbyes are mouthed through the glass. Sometimes tears
fall. Watches are checked surreptitiously as the clock nears
midnight. Minutes later, the man is dead, electrocuted by the state
of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The late hour adds drama to what already is a macabre scene. In
recent years, a number of states have changed the time of their
executions from the wee hours to earlier in the evening, partly to
avoid inconveniencing witnesses and prison workers.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina changed its time from 1 a.m. to midnight, then to
6 p.m., partly because the time could accommodate witnesses, prison
personnel and the media, said prison system spokesman John Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   He said officials were ''trying to be cognizant of all those
involved,'' such as victims' families, some of whom travel long
distances to witness an execution. Officials also were concerned
about sleepy witnesses driving home, Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Texas, Mississippi and Florida, have
changed their execution times as well. Times range from 7 a.m. in
Florida to 6 p.m. in Mississippi and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, though, doesn't appear likely to follow their lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just always been done that way, at 12:01,'' said John
Hamm, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, which
determines the time of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's executions are carried out at Holman Prison, about 40
miles northeast of Mobile, on a date designated by the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama allows 24 hours to carry out the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to start at the beginning of that 24 hours in case
something happens,'' said Holman warden Charlie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, victims' family members haven't complained about the
late hour, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a big problem for them'' because witnessing
the execution is usually important enough to relatives that the
time doesn't matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The warden said an earlier hour might disrupt the daily routine
inside Holman. ''At 12:01, the population is asleep, secure in
their cells,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Don Siegelman also isn't concerned about the late hour,
said press secretary Carrie Kurlander.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see any reason to change the time,'' she said. ''It
allows for the longest period of time to resolve any unforeseen
legal issues to arise.''

<HEADLINE> Meat Inspections Help Operations  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH L. DICKEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Jodi Yotter parks the ''Porkmobile''
and waits. Customers will come, attracted to the notion of buying
farm-fresh meat from a local producer.
</P>
<P>
   Yotter and her husband, Tom, raise hogs near Cambridge, Minn.
Two years ago, plummeting prices all but ruined their family farm's
future. They collected $17,818 for 180 hogs at market in April
1998; eight months later, when the same number of hogs fetched less
than one-fourth the price, it was time to rethink the family
business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Yotters' direct-marketing business is possible
because a year-old state meat inspection program is cutting out the
middleman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're an example of a dream come true,'' Yotter said.
''We've had to do something innovative to keep ourselves going.
Without the state, that wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Yotters drove their hogs several miles to a
federally inspected packer, where they were paid whatever the plant
offered. Their meat would change hands at least four times --
sometimes over a period of several days or weeks -- before landing
anonymously in grocery stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Yotters take their hogs to Lorentz Meats and Deli, a
small, state-inspected operation in Cannon Falls. A few days later,
the Yotters load packaged pork, bearing their own Circle Family
Farms brand name, into two freezer-trailers -- dubbed
''Porkmobiles'' I and II -- to sell directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Lorentz Meats expanded its business from cutting meat for
farmers to producing, packaging and labeling finished products
after the state started inspecting plants last year.
</P>
<P>
   Co-owner Mike Lorentz said his business would never would have
prospered as well under the U.S. Agriculture Department. While
Minnesota must follow the same guidelines as USDA, Lorentz said
state inspectors are accustomed to dealing with smaller operations
and can offer more help and suggestions for achieving compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Yotters saw their opportunity when Lorentz Meats began
producing brand names for smaller producers, and took advantage of
the emerging niche. Now they travel the state selling breakfast
sausages, bratwurst and large, quarter-hog variety packages in
parking lots and farmers' markets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the program began, about 100 large packing facilities in
Minnesota were the only in-state option for livestock farmers. Most
of those plants are run by large, national food processors making
their own brands, such as Austin-based Hormel Foods Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller processing plants, reluctant to deal with federal
regulators in Washington, shied away from expanding their
businesses beyond cutting custom meat for farmers and a handful of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 15 plants under state inspection are allowed to bring
old-time sausage recipes and farm-fresh meat to grocery stores,
butcher shops and restaurants across Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like untying our hands,'' Lorentz said. ''We can actually
sell stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While USDA is required to inspect any operation that requests
it, Lorentz said the department ''isn't very excited about taking
on small plants. It's not that they're wrong, and it's not that
they're evil. They're just not good at dealing with guys like us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tiger Woods can raise the level of play even when
he's not playing.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jim Furyk, who drew inspiration from Woods for a
stunning comeback to win the Doral-Ryder Open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk had every reason to lose hope when Franklin Langham
chipped in for birdie to take a 6-shot lead with only seven holes
to play on the tame Blue Monster.
</P>
<P>
   Langham, going after his first victory in his 101st PGA Tour
event, had not come close to a bogey all day. Furyk couldn't get an
important putt to fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Furyk had been in his position before, even if he wasn't the
main character.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, he was paired with Woods in the final round of
the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Where Woods was seven behind with
seven holes to play, Furyk was even further back.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you had told me Tiger was going to win that event, I would
have laughed at you,'' Furyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he watched Woods make eagle from the 15th fairway and
birdie two out of the final three holes, grabbing a 2-stroke
victory with a little help from fast-fading Matt Gogel.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, it was Furyk's turn.
</P>
<P>
   With five birdies on his last seven holes, Furyk closed with a
7-under 65 for a 2-stroke victory over Langham in the Doral-Ryder
Open. His 265 tied the tournament record set in 1993 by Greg
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told myself that he won that event because he really
believed he could,'' Furyk said. ''If I didn't believe I could win,
then it definitely wouldn't have happened. Maybe I learned
something from that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as exciting, but Furyk was no less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse by Langham wasn't as shocking -- he had a back-nine
38, to Gogel's 40 -- but it was no less sad.
</P>
<P>
   ''My time will come,'' Langham said, his eyes glassed over after
making three bogeys and no birdies on the final seven holes. ''If
you don't have a tough chin, you won't be out here for long.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price made a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole for a 67
that left him alone in third at 270, one stroke ahead of David
Duval (66) and Shigeki Maruyama (69), who secured his position in
the top 50 and an invitation to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk earned $540,000 for his fifth career victory. Langham came
away with a harsh dose of reality. Only a day earlier, he sounded
like a tour veteran when he said, ''Sometimes, winning just happens
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   With birdies on his first three holes, Langham doubled his
3-stroke lead and sent his personal gallery -- a couple of guys in
red shirts that said, ''Lang's Gang'' -- into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   When he birdied the par-5 eighth hole to rebuild his lead to six
strokes, he was at 23-under and was threatening to shatter Norman's
72-hole record at Doral.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he resembled another Norman -- the one who squandered a
6-stroke lead at Augusta National in the 1996 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   His shots weren't that far off the mark, but they were errant
enough to put him on the defensive. Langham missed a par putt on
No. 13 after hitting into the bunker, and missed another one from 5
feet that caught the right side of the lip on No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Van de Velde, he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do anything crazy or dumb,'' Langham said. ''I just
had a couple of errant shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And one bad break.
</P>
<P>
   His drive on the 17th, after his 6-shot lead had dwindled to
one, ran through the fairway just enough to catch a bad lie in the
rough. Having to shape the ball around the tree -- no problem, since
his natural trajectory is right to left -- the ball instead stayed
on a straight line and caromed past the bunkers into the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, I have a 20-foot putt with a chance to take
the lead,'' Furyk said.
</P>
<P>
   He had made a 12-footer on No. 12, a 20-footer on the 13th and
then hit a 6-iron on the 175-yard 15th hole for 2 feet. Like those,
this putt found the center of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Langham's last chance for a playoff ended when his 10-foot
birdie putt ran past the hole, and he had to make a 3-footer for
par. Furyk finished off his fifth career victory with a 5-foot
birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave him a little bit of light,'' Langham said. ''He took
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a shocking turnaround, just like when Woods roared from
behind to overtake a fast-fading Gogel at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   When Langham chipped in for birdie on the 11th, his lead was
back to six strokes for the third time in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point, it was tough to think things were going to turn
your way,'' Furyk said. ''I just kept plugging away.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long there was shade of Pebble Beach, and Furyk turned
into a Tiger.

<HEADLINE> Sunday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Ken Griffey Jr. and Juan Gonzalez are feeling
comfortable with
their new teams, even if these are only exhibition games.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Griffey homered in a Cincinnati Reds uniform for the first time
Sunday, leading a split squad over the Texas Rangers, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still spring,'' Griffey said. ''You're just trying to get
your eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hit a solo shot in the fourth inning off Jeff Zimmerman
that broke a 2-2 tie at Sarasota, Fla. Dmitri Young added a two-run
single and Sean Casey an RBI single for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens and Tom Evans homered for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Gonzalez played his first game against major
leaguers for the Detroit Tigers, going 1-for-3 with a single in
their 9-5 win over the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, acquired in a nine-player trade with the Rangers, had
a tight left hamstring following an exhibition game Wednesday
against Florida Southern. It wasn't anything serious, but manager
Phil Garner held him out of the Tigers' first two games of the
regular exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything felt normal,'' Gonzalez said. ''I had my first
at-bat in a different uniform. Everything else was the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who is pondering the Tigers' $140 million contract
offer, singled in the fifth inning off Jason Rakers, a right-hander
who spent most of last season with the Buffalo Bisons of the
Triple-A International League.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm real happy here,'' said Gonzalez, a two-time AL Most
Valuable Player who hit .336 with 39 homers and 128 RBIs last
season for the Rangers. ''I feel comfortable. I see everybody smile
here. Everybody is relaxed. Everybody plays better that way.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tampa, Fla., Roger Clemens was roughed up in his first spring
outing, while Jose Lima pitched two hitless innings as the Houston
Astros beat the New York Yankees 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series champion Yankees played their regular lineup
and slipped to 0-4 in exhibitions. They've been outscored 34-15 and
have not held a lead in any game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who left Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Moises Alou
back in camp, are 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, the winning pitcher when New York finished off its
Series sweep against Atlanta last October, allowed five runs and
six hits in 2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think whether I throw shutout innings or give up runs
it makes any difference,'' Clemens said. ''I worked on typical
spring training stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Mets 10, Dodgers 7:
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Al Leiter and Kevin Brown each pitched
three scoreless innings in their first outings of the spring, and
Todd Zeile singled and hit a three-run homer against his former
team. Charlie Hayes added a two-run shot for the Mets, while Adrian
Beltre hit a two-run homer and Eric Karros had a two-run double for
the Dodgers.
Pirates 5, Phillies 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., Jimmy Anderson, trying for the final spot
in the Pirates' starting rotation, pitched three hitless innings in
his first spring start. Pete Rose Jr., a non-roster player in
Phillies camp, had an RBI grounder in the seventh following Rob
Ducey's leadoff triple. Aramis Ramirez drove in three runs with two
doubles.
Cardinals 2, Expos 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Chad Hutchinson, a former quarterback at
Stanford, allowed one hit in three shutout innings for St. Louis.
The Cardinals got the go-ahead run on a sixth-inning sacrifice fly
by Larry Sutton, who replaced Mark McGwire at first base after
three innings.
Devil Rays (ss) 7, Braves 6:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Josh Hamilton doubled home the go-ahead run
in the eighth inning after Miguel Cairo was hit by loser Winston
Abreu. Braves starter John Smoltz, trying to work on his
knuckleball, allowed three runs and five hits in 1 2-3 innings.
Reds (ss) 2, Devil Rays (ss) 1:
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Greg Vaughn, whose 45 home runs helped
keep Cincinnati in contention for a playoff spot until the final
day of the regular season, was 0-for-2 against his former team.
Orioles 7, Marlins 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Charles Johnson hit a three-run homer
and Ryan Minor had a solo shot. Mike Mussina, making his first
start of the spring, allowed four earned runs and six hits in three
innings, giving up a three-run homer to Mike Lowell. The Orioles
also learned Scott Erickson will miss at least the first month of
the season following arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow.
Twins 11, Red Sox 6:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Matt Lawton had a two-run homer and an RBI
double, and Cristian Guzman hit two triples as Minnesota had 14
hits. Through five games, the Twins are hitting .324 (59-for-182),
with 12 doubles, three triples, six homers and 34 RBIs.
Indians 9, Blue Jays 6:
</P>
<P>
   At Toronto, Russell Branyan went 3-for-3 with four RBIs, hitting
a three-run homer as the teams finished a two-day trip to SkyDome.
Back in Winter Haven, Fla., Indians manager Charlie Manuel was
released from a hospital following emergency colon surgery Feb. 28.
There's no word on when he'll rejoin the team.
Diamondbacks 6, White Sox 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Greg Colbrunn continued his torrid batting
with two more hits, including a home run. Colbrunn, 7-for-11 so
far, homered in the third inning and singled in the fourth. The
homer was his second of the spring.
Mariners 10, Padres 10:
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Seattle outfielder John Mabry dislocated his
right pinkie while unsuccessfully trying to make a diving catch of
Bret Boone's drive. Mabry is expected to miss 7-10 days.
Cubs 8, Brewers 7:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Henry Rodriguez hit a two-run homer and Jeff Huson
added a two-run double for Chicago. Brewers left-hander Ricardo
Jordan sprained his left ankle while running after a popup on wet
turf.

<HEADLINE> Seven Injured in Factory Explosion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADFORD, Va. (AP) -- A fiery blast rocked an automobile parts
manufacturing plant Sunday night, injuring seven workers. Three
others were missing and presumed dead, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my understanding that there are fatalities,'' said a
local fire department dispatcher who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the 9:30 p.m. explosion at the sprawling New River
Castings complex was under investigation, said Radford Fire Chief
Lee Simpkins. According to him, about 100 workers were in the plant
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs were brought in to search the soot-covered rubble for the
missing workers.
</P>
<P>
   The injured were hospitalized, with one worker in serious but
stable condition, said David Smith, executive director of Regional
Emergency Medical Services Inc. Other employees were treated for
smoke inhalation and minor cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, flames shot as high as 20 feet and a
wall at the plant's main building was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boom, lights went out and you found your way out anyway you
could,'' Allen Bratton, a worker who just started at the plant a
week ago, told The Roanoke Times.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Birkelbach, who lives about three blocks from the plant,
said the explosion ''sounded like something was coming through the
roof of my house.''
</P>
<P>
   New River Castings and a related parts manufacturer, Lynchburg
Foundry, are owned by Troy, Mich.-based Intermet Corp., which
employes about 1,000 people in Radford. The town is about 30 miles
west of Roanoke.
</P>
<P>
   The two plants make transmission and other iron parts for the
auto industry.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cabinet OKs Lebanon Pullback  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Now that Israel has decided to withdraw troops
from south Lebanon by July, the question is whether regional power
Syria can be pressed into resuming negotiations for the peace
needed to seal the pullback.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Cabinet voted unanimously to withdraw from the zone
Israel occupies in south Lebanon by July. The vote reflected a rare
consensus among Israelis that the war's time has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an end to the tragedy,'' Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, who has promised the pullback for the past year, told
reporters. ''We are bringing the boys home.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm deadline for withdrawal could deny Syria what Israel
has said is a major lever in its negotiations. Israel says Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon, has used the low-level war
between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli forces to pressure Israel
to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The vote may be aimed at pressing Syria to return to suspended
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction to the Cabinet decision from
Syria, which wants Israel out of the zone but not in a unilateral
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks with Syria broke off in January over a Syrian demand
that Israel agree in advance to withdraw from the entire Golan
Heights, the strategic plateau seized in a 1967 war. Israel
refused, saying it first wanted to know the extent of peace and
security arrangements Syria was prepared to offer.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Israel's Cabinet said the government would
''act to ensure'' that the pullout comes within the framework of a
peace deal with Syria. But the statement and Israeli officials made
clear the withdrawal would take place if a deal were not reached.
</P>
<P>
   That holds risks. It would leave Israel's northern border
vulnerable to attacks by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas.
Israeli army chief Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz said Sunday that could lead
to even more deaths than the approximately 600 soldiers who have
died patrolling the border zone since it was established in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, Lebanon's prime minister made clear his government
would like a regional peace deal to ensure the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether or not the Israeli government decision is a maneuver,
our position has been and continues to be to welcome Israel's
withdrawal from Lebanon any time,'' Salim Hoss said in a statement.
''And if we prefer that this withdrawal come as part of a
settlement, that is because we do not trust Israeli intentions if
the withdrawal happens without an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas had no immediate reaction to
the Cabinet announcement. Israeli officials predict they will
continue their war, possibly launching new attacks into northern
Israel. Hezbollah has said it will turn to political activity after
Israel's occupation ends, but it has not said it will put down its
arms.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, frequently the
target of Hezbollah rockets, Mayor Sami Malul said the decision to
withdraw would leave his town and others living in fear of
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision is a populist decision that gambles on the backs
of border town residents,'' he told Israel's army radio, adding
that it ''gives the pretext for the next war along the northern
border.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the Cabinet decision is public consensus that
Israel's 18-year presence in Lebanon is no longer -- if it ever was
-- the right way to protect its northern towns from cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, society is saying 'enough,''' said Linda Ben Zvi, a
founder of the grassroots, pro-withdrawal group ''Four Mothers''
that was criticized as anti-patriotic when first formed three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, rising troop casualties and, in some cases,
promises of regional peace have turned public opinion toward a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and controlled most of the
country for three years until it withdrew to the border strip,
about a tenth of Lebanon's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Even most opposition politicians agree that Israel cannot win
the guerrilla war and should leave -- if only to raise the stakes in
the event of a post-withdrawal attack on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't advise anyone to test our reaction when we are
deployed on the international border and defending Israel from
there,'' Barak said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have suggested that after July, an attack on Israel's
north would be met by Israeli airstrikes inside Lebanon -- a playing
field in which Israel's top notch military has a clear advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, a close Barak aide, said
the decision was Israel's last attempt to try to make peace with
Syria, ''before a confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Rubin, a Syria expert at Israel's Bar-Ilan University,
said public fears about a withdrawal were soothed by Barak's
announcement last March, while still a candidate for prime
minister, that he would bring the troops home within a year of
being elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the government announced that it was going to withdraw,
it was as if it announced that it was safe to do that,'' Rubin
said.

<HEADLINE> Mike Murphy Works for McCain  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Murphy's political portfolio reads like
the guest list for a George W. Bush strategy session.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Texas governor's father, the former president; and
his brother, the governor of Florida. The governors of Michigan,
New Jersey and Wisconsin -- all high-profile Bush backers -- are
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy is working for John McCain, bringing his edgy,
sometimes controversial style to the insurgent hoping to catapult
past Bush and most of the Republican establishment to the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all saying, 'Whatever happened to Murphy? He used to
be one of us,''' Murphy said last week.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, Murphy has been helping elect Republicans for nearly two
decades, acquiring a reputation for a brilliant mind, wicked sense
of humor and willingness to pounce. He knows the rap against him --
''king of mudslinging,'' he says succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues say Murphy is bringing all that and more
as a chief strategist to the McCain campaign, where a small circle
of advisers direct the effort. That's just how he likes it: ''Like
all media guys,'' he says, ''I'm an egotistical control freak.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a gift for politics and a way with words,'' said Alex
Castellanos, a former partner now working for Bush. ''His brain
works a little faster than everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   And he rarely loses. By his count, he has lost just two
campaigns out of 19 or 20. Three leading GOP governors all had
Murphy behind their victories: John Engler in Michigan, Tommy
Thompson in Wisconsin and Christie Whitman in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His talent is staying a step ahead of the press, the voters and
the competition, said Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman and
Washington veteran who is advising McCain. ''He's one of those guys
who can sort of see around corners.''
</P>
<P>
   On the McCain campaign, Murphy was the chief proponent of
skipping the Iowa caucuses, which seemed risky at the time but
became a critical step toward the Arizona senator's blowout victory
in the New Hampshire primary. Murphy realized early on that
McCain's biography would be key to his message, Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy also saw around the corner in late 1991, when he was
working for President Bush's re-election effort. Bush had sky-high
approval ratings following the Persian Gulf War, but Murphy spoke
with voters in New Hampshire and studied polling data. He could see
the president's support was thin and that voters were deeply
concerned about the country's direction, said Bill Kristol, a close
friend and then-chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bush White House was extremely confident at that point,
saying we were going to crush (Democrat Bill) Clinton,'' Kristol
recalled. ''Murphy said, 'Bush is in deep, deep trouble. He needs
an aggressive reform agenda and not just the status quo.' He was
really ahead of everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   No one listened, and Murphy quit, leaking a campaign memo
outlining his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy works best in a campaign like McCain's, said Weber. The
tight-knit McCain brain trust can make bold decisions fast, without
vetting an idea through layers of decision makers, although that
carries risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the risks backfire, such as a McCain ad in South
Carolina that said Bush ''twists the truth like Clinton.'' It was a
low blow in GOP circles that hurt McCain with voters and gave Bush
cover for his own barrage of negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say Murphy was chiefly responsible for that ad, and
those who know him were not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows the power of a negative campaign,'' said Oliver
North, the Iran-Contra figure who Murphy tried to help elect to the
Senate from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In North's race against Sen. Charles Robb, Murphy began the race
with a series of warm-and-fuzzy ads. But he soon went for the
jugular: ''Why can't Chuck Robb tell the truth?'' the spot asked.
''About the cocaine parties where Robb said he never saw drugs ...
Or about the beauty queen in the hotel room in New York. Robb says
it was only a massage.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy has been unabashed about his techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll holler ..., but good fights are free press,'' he said
in 1994. ''Make the charge and let the other guy explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the McCain campaign, Murphy also has been in the center of
controversy surrounding calls the campaign made in Michigan
suggesting Bush was anti-Catholic for visiting Bob Jones
University. McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky was denying to
reporters that the campaign made the calls, although Murphy knew he
was wrong. The campaign took heat for waiting until after the polls
were closed to admit the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more likely that Murphy will be remembered for helping
move McCain from the back of a crowded pack of Republicans to a
serious challenger to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do a lot of unfashionable things that are strategically
smart,'' Murphy said. ''There are a lot of Bush guys who wonder
what hit them.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Students Released  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian officials said Monday
they had released the last students held on suspicion of stoning
the French prime minister during his recent visit to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Freih Abu Medein, minister of justice, said that the 28 students
were released late Sunday on orders from Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 Palestinian students were rounded up after a group of
students threw rocks at French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin during
his visit to Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. Some students
climbed on Jospin's fleeing limousine and smashed the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The students were protesting Jospin's statement that attacks by
Hezbollah guerrillas against Israel in south Lebanon were
''terrorist'' acts. Jospin suffered a slight head wound.
</P>
<P>
   The move to release the suspects came at a time when Palestinian
frustration with the peace process and the performance of the
Palestinian Authority was rising.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrests, there have been wide-scale protests in West
Bank universities in support of the students. Students also
protested against Israel and what they said were its minimal
concessions in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   In defiance of the Palestinian Authority, Bir Zeit students and
professors have refused to attend classes until the release of
their colleagues. University officials say disciplinary action
against the students should be taken by the university -- not the
Palestinian justice system.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, more than 100 Bir Zeit students began a hunger
strike to protest the detentions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. (AP) -- Even on a cold, windy day, a laundered
handkerchief scented with starch brings only partial relief from
the odor in Paul Thompson's mucky front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The stink of pig poop, rotten food and chickens -- not to mention
the constant strains of country music piped in to soothe the sows
and boars -- has sent owners of the nearby Florida Club at Martin
County squealing all the way to court.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 9-inch-thick case file has come to represent what
Thompson's lawyer has dubbed a battleground between the old Florida
and the new Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Thompson and his wife are typical of longtime
Floridians ''who live out in the woods and they live there because
they don't want anyone bothering them,'' Lance Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the urban development moves up the coast you are going to
see lots of people living inland and a lot more cases like this,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the Thompsons settled on a plot of dense brush,
palmetto trees and pines near this once-sleepy coastal town 30
miles north of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the dirt driveway flanked by pig pens that leads to
his house, the blue-eyed farmer said he raised and sold hogs over
the years while picking up side jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you been here all your life, unless you were born rich, you
had to do things to survive,'' said Thompson, clad in dusty brown
work pants and shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, big money began trickling into the
now-burgeoning city where orange and grapefruit groves are being
replaced by middle-class subdivisions and upscale golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   While golf course developers knew they were in sniffing distance
of Thompson's 43-year-old farm when they began their project in the
mid-1990s, court records document the complaints about the smell
and noise once the homes started selling.
</P>
<P>
   Club owners filed a lawsuit in 1997, claiming the music harasses
and annoys club members and employees, discourages sales of nearby
home sites and drives golfers away.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wackeen, an attorney for the golf course, and the club's
general manager, Greg Cotton, did not return several telephone
messages left at their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson likened the club's claims to building a house near an
airport, then suing over the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ''They knew I was here and they chose to build anyway,'' he
said. ''The bottom line is they are just a bunch of rich arrogant
people who come in and take things over by suing.''
</P>
<P>
   The case hasn't made it to trial, although the presiding judge
said he would rather have a jury decide its outcome. Circuit Judge
Ben Bryan doesn't relish the idea of having to ''sit and listen to
music and decide if pigs stink.''
</P>
<P>
   If the case gets to trial, witnesses could include a neighboring
county's sheriff's deputies, hired by Martin County officials to
conduct noise level tests along the club's 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Their testimony could be countered by experts prepared to attest
to the benefits of piping music to farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who said he's struggled to make ends meet for years,
declined an offer by the golf course to buy his land for thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The club's lawyers will tell you it's all about money, but
that's not true,'' Thompson's lawyer said. ''This guy's just living
on his land. He doesn't want to move. That land -- before the club --
was out in the middle of the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than a decade since Thompson attached a couple of
speakers to wooden poles inside the wire pig pens and tuned the
radio to 107.9, one of Stuart's country music stations.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the farmer played the music for himself. Then he
found out that the tunes could help the pigs relieve stress and, in
turn, make their meat more tender. Most of the pigs he sells are
barbecued for parties.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says he lives in a county -- and a country -- where no
one has the right to take away his freedom to raise 800-pound
Yorkshire pigs and play music.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's your bottom line.''

<HEADLINE> Nazis Said To Escape Justice  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Scores of Nazi-era war criminals are
living in freedom in Australia with little hope that they will ever
be brought to justice, the U.S. government's top Nazi hunter said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Rosenbaum, who was visiting Australia to collect evidence on
a war crimes suspect living in the United States, said both
countries unwittingly allowed war criminals to immigrate at the end
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''Australia, like the United States, was exceedingly generous
after the war in taking in many thousands of refugees from
Europe,'' said Rosenbaum, the director of the Office of Special
Investigations for the U.S. Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''A substantial number of people whose hands were bloodied with
Nazi war crimes managed to come to both of our countries.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the comments during an interview with the Australian
Broadcasting Corp., adding that ''scores, if not hundreds and
possibly more,'' were probably still living in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a spokesman for Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone
said Australia's files on war crimes suspects remained open, and
any new evidence would be followed up by the Australian Federal
Police.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia would not engage in ''show trials'' that could
lead to a suspect's acquittal and that would preclude charges being
laid by another country able to gather stronger evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia has been accused of sheltering Nazi war criminals
after war crimes suspect Konrad Kalejs was allowed to return
unchallenged in January after he fled deportation proceedings in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Kalejs, an Australian citizen, is accused of having belonged to
the Arajs Kommando squad responsible for the deaths of 30,000
people, mostly Jews, in Latvia during World War II. He was deported
from the United States and Canada after immigration authorities
ruled he was unsuitable to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Kalejs has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Australia say they do not have enough evidence to
put Kalejs on trial and can't deport him because he is a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's War Crimes Special Investigation Unit was
established in 1987, and launched 841 separate investigations into
war crimes allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The unit was disbanded in 1992. Only three people were charged,
and none were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Even when evidence existed, many suspects either could not be
found, had died, or were deemed too ill to stand trial. Often
witnesses were too old to travel to Australia to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ''Australia tried to secure a measure of justice in these cases
and deserves considerable credit for having done so,'' Rosenbaum
said. ''But the sad reality is that most of the world has given up
hope on these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum declined to give details of the case he's
investigating.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Military Spending  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Amid renewed tensions with Taiwan, China said
today it will boost military spending by 12.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The spending hike for the People's Liberation Army -- or PLA --
the world's largest military, comes on top of an increase of the
same percentage in last year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his 2000 budget to the national legislature,
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said $14.5 billion would be spent
on defense. China was expected to have an economic growth rate of 7
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new funds would mainly cover salary and allowance
increases for troops, as well as expenditures for maintaining
forces in Macau -- the territory that Portugal handed back to China
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing lavished double-digit spending increases on the PLA for
much of the 1990s, reflecting the military's political clout and
efforts to modernize the 2.5 million strong force. China's growing
military might has raised concerns among other Asian nations, some
of which have territorial disputes with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Xiang did not give a break down of the military spending, but
Western analysts believe China's actual defense spending is three
times higher than the published figure. Purchases of sophisticated
weapons at home and abroad are not included in the official figure.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the finance minister railed against waste, saying
money that China can ill-afford to spend is being lavished by
government officials on opulent hotels, office buildings and
auditoriums and on ''high consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This has aroused strong resentment among the people,'' Xiang
said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments expanded on an anti-corruption theme running
through the annual 11-day session of the National People's
Congress. At the meeting's opening on Sunday, Premier Zhu Rongji
promised a stepped up effort to punish corrupt officials, no matter
how powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Xiang said, central government spending will increase
by 12.3 percent to $111.1 billion; revenue will increase by 7.9
percent to $83.3 billion. That will leave a deficit of $27.7
billion, up from the $21.7 billion deficit Xiang said was recorded
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   China is in its third year of deficit spending to fund public
works and boost flagging economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate speech today, China's planning minister told the
legislature the government will increase fixed asset investment by
10 percent, mainly on building railways, roads, water conservancy
projects and other public works.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng Peiyan called for an all-out effort to boost the income of
China's 690 million farmers. The average rural resident had a net
income of just $267 last year, up 3.8 percent over 1998, compared
to a 9.3 percent increase for city residents, who earn an average
of $707, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ailing state-owned enterprises have shed millions of workers,
raising official fears of widespread social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the government's concern, Xiang said spending on
social security increased 110 percent last year to $4.3 billion,
much of it to support retirees and laid off government factory
workers.

<HEADLINE> Jet Skids Off Runway in California  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A Southwest Airlines 737 jet skidded off
the end of a runway Sunday and onto a nearby street, hitting one
car and narrowly missing a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   At least six people on board suffered minor injuries, including
the pilot. The driver of the car and her young daughter were not
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1455 from Las Vegas to Burbank carried 137 passengers and
five crew members. It was attempting to land at Burbank Airport,
just northeast of downtown Los Angeles, when it skidded off the end
of the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737-300 just missed a Chevron station and skidded to
a halt on Hollywood Way just after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One car on the roadway was hit by the plane, said Lt. Joe Latta.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest Airlines said it was investigating why
the aircraft was unable to stop upon landing.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Diaz, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the front landing gear collapsed, but he said
the cause of the accident was not known.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Dallas, Southwest CEO Herb Kelleher
said the plane had its last maintenance check on Thursday and
''there were no visible problems with the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no indication that the runway was wet and they have
no indications of any problems at all with the plane,'' Kelleher
said.
</P>
<P>
   While it had rained throughout the day in the area, it was not
raining in Burbank when the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCoy, a passenger on the plane, told KNBC-TV that the
plane departed from Las Vegas about two hours behind schedule
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us it might be a rough landing, but none of us were
expecting this,'' McCoy said. ''We are very lucky. All of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was doused with water as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, whose name was not released, suffered a head injury
and was released from the hospital, Kelleher said. Another person
was also released.
</P>
<P>
   Four remained in fair condition and were expected to be released
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft could remain on the roadway for as many as two
days, Latta said. He said officials were trying to determine how to
redirect traffic in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737 is the most common jetliner in the sky.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Traces Selma March Path  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- Thirty-five years after ''Bloody Sunday,''
President Clinton linked arms with civil rights leaders and marched
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in a ceremony that underscored how
far race relations have progressed. But Clinton and others
cautioned against taking that progress for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as African-American income hovers at nearly half that
of whites, we have another bridge to cross,'' the president told
some 15,000 people gathered in downtown Selma under a blazing sun.
''As long as our children continue to die as the victims of
mindless violence, we have another bridge to cross.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, March 7, 1965, white state troopers and sheriff's
deputies used tear gas, nightsticks and whips to break up an
attempt by hundreds of blacks and white supporters to cross the
bridge and march 50 miles to the state Capitol in Montgomery to
protest the denial of voting rights to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, under the protection of a federal court, Martin
Luther King Jr., led hundreds of people on the long walk to
Montgomery. Within months, the brutal images of the confrontation
at Selma still fresh in American minds, President Johnson signed
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton crossed the bridge with King's widow,
Coretta, on one arm and Rep. John L. Lewis, D-Ga., a King
lieutenant, on the other. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater were among others on the
front line.
</P>
<P>
   National Guardsmen and state troopers, black and white, saluted
as the procession passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, we have come a mighty long way, but our journey is not
over,'' Clinton said. ''For despite our unprecedented prosperity
and real social progress, there are still wide and disturbing
disparities that fall along the color line in health, in income, in
educational achievement and perceptions of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The president pointed up what he saw as the shortcomings in
racial equality with clear references to recent cases of police
brutality and continuing controversies over the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   The flying of the flag over the South Carolina capitol has been
an issue in the Republican presidential primary. On Saturday, some
2,500 people rallied in Montgomery to issue a ''Declaration of
Southern Cultural Independence'' and demand that the Confederate
flag be returned to the Alabama capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the waving symbol of one American's pride is the
shameful symbol of another American's pain, we have another bridge
to cross,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the ''Super Tuesday'' primaries looming, Clinton
lamented that ''less than half our eligible voters exercise the
right that so many here in Selma marched and died for.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shared the day with two men who helped to engineer the
original march, Rep. Lewis and Hosea Williams, another former aide
to King. Both men were badly beaten on ''Bloody Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I, too, am a son of the South, the old segregated South. Those
of you who marched 35 years ago set me free, too, on Bloody
Sunday,'' said Clinton, a native of Arkansas. ''Free to know you,
to work with you, to love you. I thank you all for what you did
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The president paid tribute to three people who died in that
struggle: local activist Jimmy Lee Jackson, the Rev. James Reeb,
who died after being beaten at a march; and Viola Liuzzo, shot to
death while driving other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We honor them for the patriots they were,'' Clinton said.
''The Voting Rights Act was signed in ink in Washington, but it
first was signed in blood in Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the changes set in motion in 1965, he said, ''Atlanta
never would have had the Super Bowl or the Olympics, and Jimmy
Carter and Bill Clinton would never have been elected president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Clinton flew to Washington, then to Chappaqua, N.Y.,
where he and his wife, Hillary, a Senate candidate, recently
purchased a home.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, McCain Fight for Life  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A feisty John McCain labeled Republican
rival George W. Bush ''so Clinton-esque it's scary,'' while a
subdued Bill Bradley complained of campaign distortions as both
underdogs looked to revive their presidential campaigns in a Super
Tuesday showdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the more competitive race of the two, both Bush and McCain
were making a final push today in California, where 162 delegates
to the GOP nominating convention were the biggest prize of the day.
Bush had the inside track on those delegates, but McCain hoped for
a moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides were quietly making plans for an exit if Vice
President Al Gore does as well as polls suggest in Tuesday's voting
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, was clinging to hopes for an upset and
sounding a bit wistful at times. ''Here we are at Super Tuesday and
we're competitive in all these states, while two months ago we were
in single digits,'' the Arizona senator said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained bitterly about a $2.5 million series of attack
ads he says are financed by Bush's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so Clinton-esque it's scary -- raise the soft money, run
the attack ads,'' he said. ''They're getting more and more like the
Clinton campaign. They'll say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed the complaint, saying he had nothing to do with
the commercials, and campaigned with the air of a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ''My response is the independents and Republicans are going to
nominate me,'' the Texas governor said. He began his final swing
through California with a rally in Oakland and was heading back to
Texas later to await the results from primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was opening his day in the Silicon Valley, and will await
results in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of bashing Gore, Bradley has toned down his assaults
in recent days and that was the tenor he adopted as the Super
Tuesday campaign was wrapping up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spoke at a black church in Buffalo, N.Y., arguing
forcefully that there's lingering racism in the nation. He made no
mention of Gore but did suggest at one point that his positions had
been distorted during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, acknowledging the new tenor, also was going easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that (Bradley's) tone changed in the last several
days, with far less of the attacks that have become commonplace,
and I wanted to reciprocate,'' the vice president said on his way
to Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Polling showed no openings for Bradley to dent the front-running
Gore and talk was turning to the potential of the former New Jersey
senator leaving the race after Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence that both Bush and Gore had reason for
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounts to the first national primary, Republicans in 13
states cast ballots with 613 delegates at stake, while Democrats in
15 states pick 1,315 delegates -- both representing more than half
the number needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
   All four candidates were dashing across the country in a
blinding swirl of rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in trouble everywhere, while McCain showed strength
in New England and was competitive in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is going to be very, very decisive,'' McCain said
as his campaign plane headed for California. He has said he would
support Bush if the Texas governor is nominated, but made it clear
he would expect Bush to run an ''entirely different'' campaign than
the bitter primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't win a general election with the type of campaign
he's run,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the keys to Tuesday's voting are New York, Ohio and
California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is running strong in polls in New England states that
vote Tuesday, while Bush holds a big lead in Georgia, Missouri and
Ohio. New York is competitive, though polls show Bush with a late
edge.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush sweep of the big three states would be devastating for
McCain, calling his campaign into question. The bad news for McCain
is that Bush holds commanding leads in California and Ohio and is
fighting hard for New York.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made a finan swing through Ohio, but there was little
evidence to support his claim of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   There are two elections going on in California, a
Republican-only vote to determine who gets the 162 delegates and a
nonbinding popularity contest. Bush had a wide lead in the delegate
hunt, while McCain hopes for a moral victory among all voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have climbed steeper hills in this campaign than what we
have to do Tuesday,'' said McCain political director John Weaver.
''Having said that, we have a difficult task ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver warned that McCain badly needs ''success stories in
California and Ohio.'' There was little evidence in the polling to
suggest that was likely, and campaign strategists planned to assess
things after the Tuesday results.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former New Jersey senator
will take the day off Wednesday, but plans campaign events in
Florida on Thursday. Other aides said discussions were being held
about the theme of an exit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing I know is there will be surprises,'' said
McCain. ''They may be unpleasant surprises.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Could Hamper McCain's Hopes  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- One of the Super Tuesday states is not like the
others, and that suits George W. Bush just fine.
</P>
<P>
   On the biggest primary day of the year, with too-close-to-call
GOP contests in several states, Georgia could serve as Bush's
insurance policy against a comeback by Republican opponent John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Texas governor's campaign doubts it'll come to
that.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief campaign rally last week in Duluth, Ga., Bush gave
the standard campaign line: ''I'm trying to win every primary, and
I'm not taking anything for granted.'' But many neutral observers
are already putting Georgia in the Bush win column -- written in
dark pencil if not chiseled in stone.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are richer delegate prizes up for grabs Tuesday:
California, New York and Ohio among them. But with 54 delegates at
stake, Georgia can hardly be called tiny in the electoral scheme of
things.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, supporters say it is being virtually ignored because --
like most of the South -- Georgia is Bush country.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by the American Research Group gave Bush a
nearly 3-1 lead among likely Republican voters in Georgia. McCain
had a 15-percentage-point lead among independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp isn't conceding anything, but the Arizona
senator canceled an Atlanta appearance and has run no television
ads in the state. Neither has Bush, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Georgia's about halfway down the list size-wise, and therefore
priority-wise for this campaign,'' said John Sours, McCain's state
campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator has spent time in smaller New England states in
addition to his numerous visits to California, the biggest primary
prize of all.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has no restriction as to who may vote in the GOP
primary, and Sours is hoping McCain will be blessed by the same
Democratic and independent fortunes that propelled him to victory
in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a major difference: Democrats didn't have a
conflicting primary on that day. They do Tuesday in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sours contends most have written off the Democratic
nomination to Vice President Al Gore. For that reason, he figures
80 to 90 percent of Georgia's primary voters will participate in
the GOP contest -- a number that would likely favor McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's wishful thinking on their part,'' Eric
Tanenblatt, Bush's Georgia campaign chairman, responded. ''While
many in the Democratic establishment are supporting Gore, Bill
Bradley does have pockets of support. Gov. (Roy) Barnes is going to
want to make sure there's a strong showing for the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many places, McCain could pick up some delegates in
Georgia even if he loses the popular vote. Three are awarded in
each of the 11 congressional districts, and 21 more go to the
statewide winner.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the campaign is feverishly distributing flyers
and making phone calls in metropolitan Atlanta -- a region
considered somewhat less conservative with a lower percentage of
native Southerners that elsewhere in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already won the Southern primaries of South Carolina
and Virginia, and he is projected to win more March 14.

<HEADLINE> Confident Gore Testing New Themes  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, so insistent that he
takes nothing for granted, slipped and called Super Tuesday ''this
final, er, semi-final uh, uh contest.'' The stumble lays bare what
he has tried to convey in code -- looking ahead to November, he's
now reaching out to Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned in these final days before the potentially
decisive Tuesday presidential primaries with new confidence and
conviviality. And he road-tested an evolving, new stump speech
aimed at more moderate voters than those he had targeted in the
Democratic nomination fight with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore hoped to debut the speech in Nashville, Tenn.,
on Tuesday night, as the results come in from 15 states, where
polls give Gore commanding leads.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Gore declined to play the harmonica for a
Seattle radio station lest it ''depress the voter turnout.'' But on
Sunday, he took the microphone from the Silver Tongues at a Rhode
Island senior center and joined them in singing ''The Tennessee
Waltz.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, he surprised reporters aboard Air Force Two with
a lengthy, rare and unannounced opportunity to question him on
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley said he will consider ending his campaign if he
does not do well Tuesday. Although Gore allies for weeks have
called on Bradley to withdraw, there have been no back-channel
communications between the Bradley and Gore camps, said a senior
aide to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   As he toys with new themes and refrains in his speeches, Gore's
message to Bradley rings clearly -- if not discordantly after the
pair's nasty primary battle to this point: My fight is
all-inclusive; you're welcome to join.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, ''a good man with a bad plan'' in the days when polls
showed him closing in on Gore, is now simply ''a good man.'' And
Gore emphasizes points of agreement with his rival -- say, on public
financing of federal campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences between Sen. Bradley and myself are nothing
compared to the differences between both of us as Democrats, on the
one hand, and both of the Republicans on the other hand,'' Gore
told senior citizens in Cranston, R.I., on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has underscored another point of consensus -- ''Both Sen.
Bradley and I agree that it's the vote on Tuesday that will
determine the nomination.'' -- in order to rally public attention to
Tuesday's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   One communications strategist said Gore recognizes that the
national audience tuning in for election results Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning is likely to be the biggest between now and
mid-August, when the Democratic National Convention meets in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Gore has begun to paint both Republican presidential
candidates, McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, as darkly
anti-everything -- the environment, public schools, patient rights,
abortion rights, gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will not even support a mandatory requirement of
child-safety trigger locks,'' Gore said, pulling from recent
headlines the story of the 6-year-old Michigan boy who shot and
killed a first-grade classmate last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gun play in the first grade is not enough? What about
kindergarten?''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, Gore will soon have all his
audiences hissing at the mention of the names Bush and McCain, as
the one at New York's 92nd Street Y did late Sunday. ''Hold off on
that,'' Gore chuckled, ''but I appreciate the sentiment, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has been jotting down speech ideas and phrases in his
Palm Pilot as they occur to him, also seized this weekend on the
theme of political reform that lifted McCain to surprising primary
victories over Bush, the once-prohibitive Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned to the left in order to block Bradley -- going
further on health care reform and gay rights, for example, than
advisers expected Gore would. But he now makes it clear he is
aiming for ''Democrats, independents and independently thinking
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly echoing McCain, Gore emphasized over the weekend the evils
of special-interest money as he railed against $2.5 million in TV
ads financed by Sam and Charles Wyly, two Texas businessmen and
Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore labeled the Wylys ''special interests'' and, borrowing
McCain's lingo, said of Bush: ''The same kind of campaign that
would accept a flood of special-interest money would lead to an
administration heavily influenced by the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Gore said the ''hammerlock'' of special
interests such as HMOs, insurance companies and pharmaceutical
makers has stymied health care reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The reform emphasis is a gamble for Gore, whose friend, Maria
Hsia, was convicted last week of campaign finance crimes that
brought Gore's 1996 fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in California
back into headlines.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bush recalled that controversy and told reporters,
''I look forward to running against Vice President Gore.''

<HEADLINE> Three Missing in Factory Explosion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADFORD, Va. (AP) -- An explosion accompanied by clouds of black
soot and flames as high as 20 feet tore through an industrial
plant, leaving three workers missing and presumed dead and injuring
seven others.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of twisted metal everywhere you look,'' Fire
Chief Lee Simpkins said Sunday following the blast at New River
Castings, an automobile parts manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 workers were in the plant at the time of the 9:30 p.m.
blast, Simpkins said. Dogs had been brought in to search the rubble
for the missing employees.
</P>
<P>
   The injured were hospitalized, with one worker in serious but
stable condition, said David Smith, executive director of Regional
Emergency Medical Services Inc. Other employees were treated for
smoke inhalation and minor cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   A worker who asked not to be identified told The Roanoke Times
that employees had been informed of a natural gas buildup in the
basement of the plant. Representatives of United Cities Gas Co., a
natural gas supplier, were on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, flames shot as high as 20 feet and a
wall at the plant's main building was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden I saw a big orange ball of fire, and
everything was pitch black,'' plant worker Scott Hetherington told
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Birkelbach, who lives about three blocks from the plant,
said the explosion ''sounded like something was coming through the
roof of my house.''
</P>
<P>
   New River Castings and a related parts manufacturer, Lynchburg
Foundry, are owned by Troy, Mich.-based Intermet Corp., which
employes about 1,000 people in Radford. The town is about 30 miles
west of Roanoke.
</P>
<P>
   The two plants make transmission and other iron parts for the
auto industry.

Clinton Traces Selma March Path
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- Thirty-five years after ''Bloody Sunday,'' President
Clinton linked arms with civil rights leaders and marched across the Edmund
Pettus Bridge in a ceremony that underscored how far race relations have
progressed. But Clinton and others cautioned against taking that progress for
granted. ''As long as African-American income hovers at nearly half that of
whites, we have another bridge to cross,'' the president told some 15,000 people
gathered in downtown Selma under a blazing sun. ''As long as our children
continue to die as the victims of mindless violence, we have another bridge to
cross.''

Jet Skids Off Runway in California

   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A Southwest Airlines 737 jet skidded off the end of a
runway Sunday and onto a nearby street, hitting one car and narrowly missing a
gas station. At least six people on board suffered minor injuries, including the
pilot. The driver of the car and her young daughter were not hurt. Flight 1455
from Las Vegas to Burbank carried 137 passengers and five crew members. It was
attempting to land at Burbank Airport, just northeast of downtown Los Angeles,

Seven Injured in Factory Explosion

   RADFORD, Va. (AP) -- A fiery blast rocked an automobile parts manufacturing
plant Sunday night, injuring seven workers. Three others were missing and
presumed dead, authorities said. ''It's my understanding that there are
fatalities,'' said a local fire department dispatcher who declined to give his
name. The cause of the 9:30 p.m. explosion at the sprawling New River Castings
complex was under investigation, said Radford Fire Chief Lee Simpkins. According
to him, about 100 workers were in the plant at the time.

New Challenges in Mozambique
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- For Mozambicans who managed to survive vicious
flooding and days stranded in trees and on rooftops to make it to an aid camp,
there was a new challenge: Getting food and water. As floodwaters in the swollen
Limpopo and Save rivers receded, relief efforts shifted Sunday from plucking
survivors from harm's way to dispensing aid to hundreds of thousands of
desperate survivors, said Brenda Barton, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food
Program. Many survivors were still only accessible by air. Aid workers said they
expected the death toll from the disaster to soar into the thousands as water
levels dropped and revealed the mud-covered remains of the dead.

Bradley, McCain Keep Campaigning
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain ruled out running as a third-party
candidate, and both he and Democrat Bill Bradley said Sunday that they could
support their rivals in defeat, as the presidential nomination races ahead for a
climactic multistate showdown Tuesday. They expressed confidence as they made
the TV talk show rounds, even as aides braced for the worst by quietly making
plans for dignified exits. Bradley advisers acknowledged he has little chance of
loosening the vice president's grip on every ''Super Tuesday'' state. The McCain
team held out hope for an election night surprise.

Poor, Sick in Need of New Benefits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers are bolstering the argument that Medicare
prescription drug benefits should go to the neediest senior citizens, as the
debate over who should be eligible continues. ''There is a core group of elderly
-- those who are poor and those who have chronic illness -- who have the
greatest need for a drug benefit,'' said John K. Inglehart, founding editor of
the policy journal Health Affairs, which published three new studies of
retirees' prescription costs and usage in an issue being released Monday. The
findings come as Congress and the Clinton administration wrestle over how best
to help elderly and disabled, who get health insurance under Medicare, pay for
drugs. Medicare provides no reimbursement for most prescriptions.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Marino was offered Minnesota's starting quarterback
job last week in talks with Vikings coach Dennis Green, according to broadcast

that Green assured the former Miami Dolphins star that he would be the starter.
Marino, who has not attracted much interest from other teams, also is
considering retirement.

<HEADLINE> Cheers and boos as Hillary Clinton marches in St. Patrick's parade  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton left the comfort of a
friendly church for an early St. Patrick's Day parade at which she
was both cheered and booed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went from Riverside Church in Manhattan, where she was
repeatedly applauded for calling for better police-community
relations, to a parade in Woodside, Queens, where she was
alternately heckled and admired.
</P>
<P>
   The uncontrollable nature of the parade crowd stood in stark
contrast with many other Clinton campaign events, which tend to
feature Democratic Party members or other supportive audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go back to Arkansas, carpetbagger!'' called out Bernie
Mulligan, of Queens, who works for a cable TV company.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McEvoy, a legal secretary who was one of a group of
hecklers that followed Clinton along the route, said: ''She's a
liar and a cheat and a carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the president, McEvoy added: ''If she had any
decency she'd have left him.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the onlookers, some of them holding signs saying
''Irish-Americans for Hillary,'' clapped and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's got my vote,'' said Marge Toner, who was wearing a green
sweater with shamrocks on it. ''She's willing to push for health
insurance, and she's a little more open to other points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's great -- a woman, a strong woman. She knows the
politics,'' said Susan DiScala.
</P>
<P>
   With a green scarf tucked into her coat, the first lady smiled,
waved and posed for pictures as she marched seven blocks with a
group of Democrats, including City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Public
Advocate Mark Green, City Council President Peter Vallone and U.S.
Reps. Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she were enjoying the march, Clinton said: ''I sure am.
How could you not? It's a glorious day with a lot of happy
people.''
</P>
<P>
   She ignored the jeers that occasionally emanated from the
several thousand people scattered along the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   The event was billed as the first local inclusive St. Patrick's
Day parade because it allowed gay organizations to participate.
Among them were Lavender and Green, a gay Irish group that had
about two dozen members walking a half-block behind the first lady.
They also received an occasional boo, but one of them, Barbara
Moore, said: ''Hate is not going to win today.''
</P>
<P>
   The main St. Patrick's Day parade, held March 17 on Fifth
Avenue, excludes the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization on the
grounds that the event is run by a Catholic fraternal group, the
Ancient Order of Hibernians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Sunday she hoped the main parade would be
inclusive. But even if it's not, she said, she'll attend the March
17 event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm marching,'' she said with a firm nod.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday in a speech at Riverside Church in Manhattan, the
first lady chastised city officials for refusing to acknowledge
problems with the police force in the aftermath of the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leadership in this city refuses to reach out to work with
a community in pain or even acknowledge that there is a problem,''
she told 3,000 worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a remark President Clinton made Friday, she said some
city residents believe that if Amadou Diallo ''had been a young
white man in an all-white neighborhood, he would still be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, an unarmed black African immigrant, was shot to death
last year by four white officers. The cops were acquitted of murder
about two weeks ago, sparking protests led by activist the Rev. Al
Sharpton and others.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, spokesman for Clinton's Republican rival for
the U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said that ''with the
Clintons, politics motivates everything, and nothing they do
happens accidentally, so it's no coincidence that President
Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and Al Sharpton all chose to read off the
same script regarding the Diallo case.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, wearing a green sweater, marched at another parade
Sunday in Staten Island with the borough's president, Guy Molinari,
behind the New York Police Department color guard.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals Clinton made to improve local policing were:
</P>
<P>
   --Better pay for cops.
</P>
<P>
   --A youth academy modeled on the Reserve Officers Training Corps
to attract minority high school students to the New York Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   --More funding for production of a high-tech gun scanner that
would scan not just for metal but for the shape of a gun. The
scanners are being developed by the U.S. Departments of Defense and
Justice and by private companies around the country, including one
upstate in the Utica-Rome area. Police thought Diallo had a gun
when he pulled out his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also commended two precincts in the South Bronx for
reducing both crime and civilian complaints through better
training, mentoring for new cops and holding officers accountable
for complaints against them.

<HEADLINE> Ailing cardinal attends Sunday Mass, to see medal legislation  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos NYR101-102
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the day President Clinton signed legislation
awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal, an ailing Cardinal John
O'Connor attended Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral but was not the
main celebrant.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, Cardinal O'Connor has served the
Catholic Church and our nation with constancy and commitment,''
Clinton said in a statement issued Sunday in Selma, Ala., where he
took part in a re-enactment of a 1965 civil rights march.
</P>
<P>
   The medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, and
both houses rushed earlier to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of
his precarious health. The medal has been awarded to 250 people,
including George Washington, the Wright Brothers and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was to be presented with copies of the legislation at
his home this morning.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, recuperating from brain tumor surgery last year, drew
applause from worshippers at St. Patrick's on Sunday. In brief
remarks at the start of the service, he called it ''a great
privilege'' to be present as Auxiliary Bishop William McCormack
filled in as celebrant.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor sat behind the altar. He was helped to his feet
periodically by an assistant for prayers and hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Joseph Zwilling said the 80-year-old archbishop was
''feeling better the last few days but still weak and not able to
resume a regular schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor fell twice after his return to duty last October but
celebrated Mass regularly until two weeks ago. He suffers from
partial hearing loss and has difficulty reading as a result of his
illness and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said it was unlikely that O'Connor would celebrate Mass
on Ash Wednesday. He said there was no decision yet on whether the
cardinal would be on the church steps overlooking Fifth Avenue on
St. Patrick's Day, as is his custom.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Clinton recalled O'Connor's early days
performing parish work in his native Philadelphia, his service as a
military chaplain in Korea and Vietnam and his 16 years leading the
New York Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was the soldier on the battlefield or the patient
dying of AIDS, Cardinal O'Connor has ministered with a gentle
spirit and a loving heart,'' Clinton said. ''Through it all, he has
stood strong as an advocate for the poor, a champion for workers
and an inspiration for millions.''

<HEADLINE> Hygiene Key To Cutting Infections  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- New technology and simple measures like frequent
hand- washing could cut back on infections contracted in hospitals,
which kill as many as 88,000 people each year, a researcher says.
</P>
<P>
   New devices such as catheters coated with antibiotics have
proved effective against infection at health facilities, said Dr.
Richard P. Wenzel, chairman of internal medicine at the Medical
College of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But new technology is far costlier than simple, equally
important steps -- like getting doctors and nurses to wash their
hands after each patient contact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hand-washing is cheap, but the impact from it is great,''
Wenzel said. He spoke here Sunday at the opening of a five-day U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conference on preventing
and reducing health care-associated infections.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel said bloodstream infections contracted at health care
facilities could be the nation's eighth leading cause of death,
claiming more than 25,000 people each year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the CDC reported that the rate of such infections
fell by about 44 percent in the 1990s in medical intensive care
units at 300 facilities that report to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The infections typically are caused by catheters, intravenous
lines and breathing tubes common to most hospital stays. Such
devices allow bacteria easy entry into the body.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel said simply placing an alcohol dispenser at each patient
bed cut blood infection rates by 40 percent in one hospital because
workers disinfected their hands more often.
</P>
<P>
   Another effective method is for doctors to model good habits in
front of colleagues and medical students.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm up in the ICU and I'm washing my hands, I always tell
the students, 'Oh this feels good, oh it's phenomenal,''' Wenzel
said. ''I give them the idea that they are missing out on something
if they don't wash their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Jarvis, with the CDC's Hospital Infection Program,
said medical professionals must control infections better because
the number of older Americans will soar in the next century. The
elderly are particularly at risk for infection and more likely to
spend time in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis estimated the population of people over 65 in the U.S. --
40 million in 1998 -- is likely to double by 2035.

<HEADLINE> Phony Businesses Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One classified ad guarantees that by stuffing
envelopes at home, you can easily earn thousands of dollars.
Another promises $50,000 a year for doing medical billing from your
own computer. A third claims you can take in $10,000 monthly by
owning and operating pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers are actually losing millions of dollars a year
responding to such phony business opportunities touted in published
ads and on the Internet, said government authorities, who are
filing a wave of cases against those behind the scams.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department, several
state attorneys general and securities officials are announcing
today they have filed complaints against 68 operations they accuse
of deceiving consumers about work-at-home and other business
ventures, such as vending machine chains.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 newspapers have agreed to include their own
classified ads informing consumers of what to look for in a
legitimate business promotion, officials said. Additionally, more
than 85 of the papers have agreed to screen out deceptive ads, such
as those that make earnings claims without any disclosure of how
much consumers have actually made.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters targeted consumers with short teaser ads that
promised the chance to make money in various business plans -- from
working at home to buying vending machines. Consumers who called
for more information received a deceptive pitch about how much help
they would get in setting up their business and how much money they
would make, said Steve Gurwitz, assistant director in the Division
of Marketing Practices at the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Torland of San Antonio, a full-time college student, wanted
to earn some money while working his own hours, when he responded
to an ad offering him just that for doing medical billing from his
home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of being able to come home and work on my own time
and make some money, it was worth checking out,'' said Torland.
''At first the way the ad was worded I thought I would actually be
working for a business.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he paid $350 for the software to do the billing,
Torland learned that the promoter was not going to provide him with
any clients. He asked for a refund, but was put off time and again.
When Torland set up a Web site detailing his experience, he
received e-mails from others with similar tales. He eventually
lodged his complaint with regulators, but said he is still waiting
to get his money back.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, consumers paid as much as $5,000 to $7,000 to
buy vending machines or pay phones they were told they could
operate for profit. But the companies advertising these ventures
often furnished people with old equipment and could not secure them
the kinds of locations that would actually bring them any money,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, big, established companies that place many vending
machines are given the prime spots, leaving a limited number of
lucrative locations for individuals. And in at least a few
instances, consumers never even got the phones or machines for
which they had paid thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules require companies selling franchises and other
business ventures to provide potential customers with disclosure
information that includes the identities of current and former
franchises. The rules also require that claims about potential
earnings be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints filed today would force the targeted promoters to
change their business practices and provide consumers with the
required information.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed 13 cases in federal court, nine of which resulted
in a temporary restraining order with the business' assets frozen
to provide monetary refunds to consumers. The Justice Department
filed another 22 complaints for the FTC in federal court, seeking
civil penalties. State officials filed the remaining 33 actions.

<HEADLINE> GOP House Members Lose Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
four Republican members of Congress who challenged President
Clinton's authority to provide federal help for efforts to preserve
some rivers and riverside communities.
</P>
<P>
   The justices let stand rulings that said the four legislators
lack the legal standing to challenge an executive order they
contend exceeded the president's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Today's order, which denied review and was unaccompanied by any
additional comment, is a setback for Reps. Helen Chenoweth of
Idaho, Bob Schaffer of Colorado, Don Young of Alaska and Richard
Pombo of California.
</P>
<P>
   Their appeal had contended that ''the president may not adopt a
new federal program by means of an executive order because Congress
has not delegated the requisite authority to do so.'' They said the
separation of powers was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting that argument last July, the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the lawsuit is
barred by a 1997 Supreme Court decision. In it, the justices said
individual members of Congress lacked the legal standing to go into
court and challenge the Line Item Veto Act.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton announced his
intention to create the American Heritage Rivers Initiative. Under
it, federal agencies would provide support for local efforts to
preserve certain historic rivers and river towns.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth, Schaffer and Pombo introduced a bill ''to terminate
further development and implementation'' of the initiative but the
bill was never voted on. The president formally established the
initiative in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The four members of Congress then sued, contending the
initiative violates various federal laws and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out the case, and the appeals court
refused to reinstate it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The representatives do not allege that the necessary
majorities in Congress voted to block the AHRI,'' the appeals court
said. ''They cannot claim their votes were effectively nullified by
the machinations of the executive.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Chenoweth vs. Clinton, 99-944.

<HEADLINE> Historians, Libraries Lose Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of historians and librarians who
oppose a rule that lets federal agencies destroy computer records
as long as they keep a copy on paper or microfilm lost a Supreme
Court appeal today.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away an appeal in which the
librarians and historians argued that paper records cannot be
searched and indexed as easily as electronic records.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires the National Archives to set standards for
preserving government records. Agencies are barred from destroying
records without the archives' approval.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the archives issued a rule intended to avoid overload
in government agency computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The rule let agencies delete certain e-mails and other records
from desktop computers once they are no longer useful to the agency
and have been copied to the agency's official recordkeeping system.
Such systems may be in electronic form, paper or microfilm.
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association, the American Historical
Association and Ralph Nader's Public Citizen challenged the rule in
federal court. They argued that computer records can reveal more
than paper about the making of policy -- about who saw and revised a
document before it reached final form.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out the rule, saying Archivist John W.
Carlin exceeded his authority by authorizing destruction of records
reflecting substantive agency decisions in addition to
''housekeeping'' records.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
reinstated the rule last August. The appeals court agreed that
''electronic recordkeeping has advantages over paper
recordkeeping,'' but added that federal law does not require all
agencies to have electronic systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the historians and
librarians said the law lets the archivist adopt different rules
for various agencies ''that distinguish electronic records ...
worth preserving from those that are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers said records kept on desktop computers might
not be searched any more easily than those transferred to paper
recordkeeping. In any event, they said, Carlin is considering
revisions to the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Public Citizen vs. Carlin, 99-782.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 16; Nasdaq Climbs 27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today,
with technology shares leading the gainers in a quiet session.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 16.44 at 10,350.76.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 2.11 to 1,407.06, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 27.67 at 4,942.67.
</P>
<P>
   Most market indicators were little changed from Friday as
investors paused to plot their next course after last week's rally,
in which the Dow soared 505.08 points and the Nasdaq and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose to new records.
</P>
<P>
   Also, investors opted to stay on the sidelines in advance of a
midday speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Fed
chairman was expected to discuss the new economy, but market
watchers were also anticipating some hints on the Fed's future
course on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate debate has dominated Wall Street this year.
The Fed has raised rates four times since last June in an effort to
slow the pace of economic growth and hold off inflation. Last
Friday, a report of moderating job growth offered one of the first
signs that the Fed is succeeding in its goal and sparked a wave of
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Today, technology stocks were posting the sharpest gains.
Internet Capital Group soared 29\ to 148 5/16 after Banc Boston
Robertson Stephens raised its rating on the stock to ''strong
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! rose 13| to 171|.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 152.71 million
shares, well behind Friday's brisk pace.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Testimony Disclosure  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors are free to tell jurors that
defendants' courtroom presence during a trial allows them to tailor
their testimony to fit the evidence, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision in a New York case said such comments by
prosecutors to juries do not violate defendants' right to attend
their trial and testify in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see no reason to depart from the practice of treating
testifying defendants the same as other witnesses,'' Justice
Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allowing comment upon the fact that a defendant's presence in
the courtroom provides him a unique opportunity to tailor his
testimony is appropriate and ... sometimes essential to the central
function of the trial, which is to discover the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's dissenters said the ruling ''transforms a
defendant's presence at trial from a Sixth Amendment right into an
automatic burden on his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that barred
prosecutors from making general attacks on the credibility of
defendants for being present at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Agard of Queens in New York City was convicted in 1991 of
sodomy and weapons possession and was sentenced to 10 to 20 years
in prison. He testified in his own defense at his state court
trial, saying he had consensual sex with the woman who accused him.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments, the prosecutor told jurors that unlike
other witnesses, Agard was allowed to be in court and hear all the
other testimony before he took the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''That gives you a big advantage, doesn't it?'' the prosecutor
said. ''You get to sit here and think, 'What am I going to say ...
how am I going to fit it into the evidence?'''
</P>
<P>
   Agard appealed, relying on a 1965 Supreme Court decision that
said prosecutors cannot refer to a defendant's decision not to
testify as an indication of guilt. Such statements by prosecutors
would violate defendants' right not to incriminate themselves,
guaranteed by the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, the court ruled
in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled against Agard. But the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said the prosecutor's argument violated his Fifth
Amendment right to testify in his own defense and his Sixth
Amendment right to attend the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision said the 1965 ruling should not control Agard's
case.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old ruling ''prohibits a judge and prosecutor from
suggesting to the jury that it may treat the defendant's silence as
substantive evidence of guilt,'' Scalia said. ''The prosecutor's
comments in this case, by contrast, concerned (Agard's) credibility
as a witness, and therefore were in accord with our longstanding
rule that when a defendant takes the stand, his credibility may be
impeached and his testimony assailed like that of any other
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said the prosecutor's decision to wait until her closing
argument, rather than during cross-examination, to mention Agard's
''advantage'' made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer agreed that the
appeals court was wrong but did not join the majority's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter dissented.
Writing for the two, Ginsburg said, ''The generic accusation that
today's decision permits ... does not serve to distinguish guilty
defendants from innocent ones. Every criminal defendant, guilty or
not, has the right to attend his trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Portuondo vs. Agard, 98-1170.

<HEADLINE> Ailing cardinal presented with Congressional Gold Medallegislation  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor was presented with a
proclamation today awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal, the
nation's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It meant a great deal to him. He was very, very happy, very
pleased about the whole thing,'' said Joseph Zwilling, the
cardinal's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y.,
presented the framed proclamation to O'Connor in a private ceremony
at his Manhattan residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''His fight for economic justice, for the working conditions of
people, for all people throughout the city, the state and the
country who need help, is emblematic of a great man,'' said
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I told him that the first Congressional Gold Medal was
given to the patriots at Bunker Hill, the militia, he said, 'That's
great because I'm a military man too,''' said Schumer, speaking in
front of St. Patrick's Cathedral. O'Connor served as a Navy and
Marine Corps chaplain in Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Fossella said: ''He represents the finest that America has had
to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday, President Clinton said, ''For more than
50 years, Cardinal O'Connor has served the Catholic Church and our
nation with constancy and commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled O'Connor's early days performing parish work in his
native Philadelphia, his service as a military chaplain and his 16
years leading the New York Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was the soldier on the battlefield or the patient
dying of AIDS, Cardinal O'Connor has ministered with a gentle
spirit and a loving heart,'' Clinton said. ''Through it all, he has
stood strong as an advocate for the poor, a champion for workers
and an inspiration for millions.''
</P>
<P>
   The medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, and
both houses rushed to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of his
precarious health. It has been awarded to 250 people, including
George Washington, the Wright Brothers and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, recuperating from brain tumor surgery last year, drew
applause from worshippers at St. Patrick's on Sunday. In brief
remarks at the start of the service, he called it ''a great
privilege'' to be present as Auxiliary Bishop William McCormack
filled in as celebrant.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor sat behind the altar and was helped to his feet
periodically by an assistant for prayers and hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Zwilling said the 80-year-old archbishop was ''feeling
better the last few days but still weak and not able to resume a
regular schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor fell twice after his return to duty last October but
celebrated Mass regularly until two weeks ago. He suffers from
partial hearing loss and has difficulty reading as a result of his
illness and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said it was unlikely that O'Connor would celebrate Mass
on Ash Wednesday. He said there was no decision yet on whether the
cardinal would be on the church steps overlooking Fifth Avenue on
St. Patrick's Day, as is his custom.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's debuts in New York suburbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Kohl's Corp., the Menomonee Falls-based
retailer that has been expanding throughout the country in recent
years, opened 18 stores this week in one of the nation's most
expensive markets: New York.
</P>
<P>
   Official opening ceremonies are scheduled Friday for seven
stores on Long Island and 11 in suburban New Jersey. Stores are
also planned for Westchester and Rockland counties later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's, known for merchandise that is cheaper than traditional
department stores but a step up from discount stores, promoted its
entry into New York by going on the Jumbotron in Times Square on
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also running broadcast and print advertisements,
some of them tailored for the New York metropolitan area. But many
of the commercials will be the same Kohl's runs elsewhere, said
Gary Vasques, the company's executive vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not changing our personality for New York,'' he said.
''We're bring Kohl's to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Target, a Minneapolis-based discount chain, opened in the New
York area a couple of years ago and is doing well, a good sign for
Kohl's, said Bruce C. Olson, a retail analyst with Strong Capital
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers have recently embraced Kohl's in Dallas, Philadelphia
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's was able to cut costs in the expensive New York market by
buying space from Caldor, which went bankrupt several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With its opening this week, Kohl's has 279 stores and 45,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's shares closed at $76 Friday, down $1, on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Phony Job Pushers Face Crack Down  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Instead of hauling in promised big bucks,
Americans are losing millions of dollars by responding to phony
business opportunities touted in classified ads, government
authorities said Monday in announcing a wave of cases against such
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and state
attorneys general and securities officials have filed complaints
against 68 operations they accuse of deceiving people about
work-at-home and other business ventures, such as renting out
vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   To raise awareness, more than 100 newspapers have agreed to
publish classified ads informing consumers of what to look for in
legitimate business promotions, officials said. Additionally, 85 of
the papers have agreed to screen out deceptive ads, such as those
that make earnings claims without disclosing how much previous
participants actually have made.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters targeted consumers whose short teaser ads promise
the chance to make money in various business plans. For example,
some ads promise that by stuffing envelopes at home, people can
easily earn thousands of dollars. Others claim participants can
take in $10,000 monthly by owning and operating pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects who requested more information received deceptive
pitches about how much help they would get in setting up their
businesses and how much money they would make, said Steve Gurwitz,
assistant director in the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Torland of San Antonio, a full-time college student, who
wanted to earn some money in his off hours, he responded to an ad
offering just that for doing medical billing from his home
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of being able to come home and work on my own time
and make some money, it was worth checking out,'' said Torland.
''At first, the way the ad was worded, I thought I would actually
be working for a business.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he paid $350 for the software to do the billing,
Torland learned that the promoter was not going to provide him with
clients. He asked for a refund but was put off repeatedly. When
Torland set up a World Wide Web site detailing his experience, he
received e-mails from others with similar tales. He eventually
lodged his complaint with regulators but said he is still waiting
to get his money back.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, consumers paid as much as $5,000 to $7,000 for
vending machines or pay phones they were told they could operate
for profit. The companies advertising these ventures often
furnished people old equipment and could not secure them the kinds
of locations that would actually bring in money, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules require companies selling franchises and other
business ventures to provide potential customers with disclosure
information that includes the identities of current and former
franchisees. The rules also require that claims about potential
earnings be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints filed Monday would force the targeted promoters
to change their business practices and provide prospects with the
required information.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed 13 cases in federal court, nine of which resulted
in temporary restraining orders with the business' assets frozen to
provide refunds to buyers. The Justice Department filed another 22
complaints for the FTC in federal court, seeking civil penalties.
State officials filed the remaining 33 actions.

<HEADLINE> FTC Tips on Recognizing Phony Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Federal Trade Commission recommendations for people
to consider
before entering into business opportunities:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Get all earnings claims in writing. Be sure the information
includes the number and percentage of recent or current clients who
have earned at least as much as the promoter claims. If the
promoter hesitates or refuses to give the information in writing,
find another business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   --Interview references provided by the promoter of the business
opportunity. The FTC requires business promoters to give potential
purchasers the names, addresses and phone numbers of at least 10
prior purchasers who live the closest to the potential purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   --Study the business opportunity's franchise disclosure document.
Under the FTC Franchise Rule, most business opportunity promoters
are required to provide this document to potential purchasers. It
includes information about the company, including whether it has
faced lawsuits from prior purchasers or lawsuits alleging fraud.
</P>
<P>
   --Contact the attorney general's office, state or county consumer
protection agency and Better Business Bureau in the area in which
the promoter is based and where you live.
</P>
<P>
   --If the business opportunity involves selling products from
well-known companies, call their legal departments to determine
whether the opportunity and its promoter are affiliated with the
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   --Consult an attorney, accountant or other business adviser
before you put down money or sign papers. Entering into a business
opportunity can be costly, so it's best to have an expert check out
the contract first.

<HEADLINE> McCain's New York chief says strange ballot helps  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Maintaining that unusual ballot rules for
the state's Republican primary may a blessing for John McCain, his
New York campaign chief on Monday predicted victory for the Arizona
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we may surprise a lot of people with the results
tomorrow night,'' Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari
said, adding that New York is a must-win for the senator in his
battle against Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's New York campaign chief, Gov. George Pataki, refused to
make a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful that Governor Bush will win tomorrow,'' Pataki
said. ''I have no greater information than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of a host of states, including most of New
England, California and Ohio, holding primaries on what has become
known as ''Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Bush and McCain locked in a tough battle
for the 93 GOP delegates at stake in New York's primary. Another
eight unpledged delegates will be selected later by state party
leaders. Almost all will likely be in the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, recent polls have all shown Vice
President Al Gore with almost 2-1 leads over former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, a one-time Hall of Fame player with the New
York Knicks basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradley's top New York backer, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, spoke Monday as if that race was already over.
</P>
<P>
   ''He fought handsomely, gallantly and right to the end,''
Moynihan told Albany's WROW-AM radio. ''And that is how you measure
a person's quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic voters in New York will be electing 158 pledged
delegates on Tuesday to the Democratic National Convention with
another 85 pledged delegates elected later by party leaders based
on the primary's popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, primary polls are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. in New
York City, on Long Island and in Westchester, Orange, Rockland and
Erie counties. The polls are open from noon to 9 p.m. in the rest
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   It is a closed primary in which only enrolled Democrats can vote
in that primary and only Republicans can cast ballots in the GOP
contest. There is no same-day voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, New York voters get to cast ballots
directly for the candidates, and for prospective delegates if they
wish. Those delegates are apportioned based on the percentage of
the popular vote the candidates receive.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, things are more complicated. There is no
direct vote for the candidates. Voters instead cast ballots for
prospective national convention delegates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts. In effect, there are 31 separate GOP
mini-primaries with three delegates at stake in each congressional
district. Voters can split their tickets, choosing, say, two Bush
delegates and one McCain delegate in a particular district.
</P>
<P>
   There is another wrinkle that McCain backers believe will help
them. While each congressional district elects three delegates,
each contains a different number of enrolled Republicans, and
Democrats. For instance, in Long Island's 3rd Congressional
District represented by Republican Peter King, who recently
switched his allegiance from Bush to McCain, there are 182,651
enrolled Republicans. But in Brooklyn's 11th Congressional
District, represented by Democrat Major Owens, there are just
15,872 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the minority districts where you don't have a lot of
Republicans, you also don't have a lot of Republican
organization,'' Molinari said. ''We do have key people who live in
those neighborhoods and a delegate there counts as much as in the
most populous Republican areas in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Pataki and virtually the entire state GOP hierarchy are
backing Bush, most of his delegate slates in big Republican areas
are populated with well-known GOP figures. McCain slates generally
contain names little known to most voters. That is also the case,
however, for Bush slates in areas of the state where there are few
Republicans, including parts of heavily Democratic New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush backers in New York conceded Monday that McCain could
do well in the city, on parts of Long Island and in suburban
Westchester County just north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I feel comfortable that we're going to win a
majority of the districts,'' Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrat Moynihan, who once predicted Gore couldn't be
elected in November, said the GOP race has turned so bitter that he
now believes the vice president can win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Republicans may have done themselves some harm,''
the professorial Moynihan said, adding that no matter who the
Republicans select, ''the Democratic candidate need only go around
and repeat what the other has said about the nominee.''

<HEADLINE> Guilty verdict in cover-up of cop's role in Louima attack  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ex-policeman Charles Schwarz and two other cops
were found guilty today of conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in
the precinct house torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn federal court jury reached the verdict on its fourth
day of deliberations in the second trial stemming from the Aug. 9,
1997, incident that horrified an already race-conscious city.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Wiese, 37, and Thomas Bruder,
34, were found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct justice because
they had claimed that Schwarz was not present during the brutal
attack. The penalty is up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for all three men said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz already faces a possible life sentence for his 1999
conviction on violating Louima's civil rights by holding him down
as fellow Officer Justin Volpe sodomized him with a broken-off
broom handle.
</P>
<P>
   Louima suffered severe internal injuries, including a ruptured
bladder and colon, and spent two months in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz is already in custody on the earlier conviction, and as
he was led out of the courtroom today he could be heard loudly
cursing. Schwarz attorney Ron Fischetti said he asked Schwarz to be
placed on a suicide watch in jail because he was so upset.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder, who like Wiese is still free on $100,000 bail, also
reacted angrily as he walked into the hallway outside the courtroom
to try to comfort his wailing mother and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''You tell the truth and this is what happens,'' Bruder ranted.
''I'll be fine, nobody's stronger than me. I'm stronger than anyone
in this building.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz's wife, Andra, said federal prosecutors ''were not
seeking the truth. They just want a conviction. I'm just fed up.
We're not going to let them get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima was not in the courtroom for the verdict but his family
members scheduled a news conference for later today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that as a result of today's verdict a message will be
sent to police officers all over the country that they will be held
accountable if and when they obstruct justice,'' Sanford
Rubenstein, an attorney representing the Louima family, said
outside the courthouse. ''What Abner Louima wants more than
anything else is for what happened to him to never happen to anyone
else's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London, suggested that the controversial
acquittal of four white officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo
and the flood of protests and public debate that followed may have
put pressure on this jury, which was composed of six white and six
nonwhite jurors. ''You can't be naive enough to ignore that it must
have had some impact,'' London said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad accused the three
defendants of telling ''lie after lie'' to save Schwarz. He offered
phone records as evidence that the cops, who rarely spoke prior to
the incident, had scores of conversations in the weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
   While Vinegrad said the timing and pattern of the calls proved a
conspiracy, defense lawyers argued they were meaningless without
knowledge of their contents.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz testified that the phone calls were consultations with
police union delegates and other cops. But he insisted that he
barely knew Volpe and never spoke with his fellow officer.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's dramatic highlights were provided by Volpe, as the
first defense witness, and Schwarz as the last. Both contended that
Schwarz was never in the 70th Precinct lavatory during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who is serving 30 years after pleading guilty to
attacking Louima, was subpoenaed from prison to tell his story
under oath for the first time. He testified that Wiese was present,
but made no move to join the assault or try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never saw Schwarz in the bathroom at any time,'' Volpe told
the jury, adding that he could not serve his time ''with a clear
conscience ... knowing that another man is paying for the crime
that I committed.''
</P>
<P>
   That differed sharply from Wiese's own version, given to
detectives shortly after the incident. Wiese said he entered the
bathroom to find Volpe standing over Louima, stick in hand, and
then dragged the victim to safety by his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's attorney, Joseph Tacopina, did not cross-examine Volpe,
saying Schwarz's role was the only question at issue, and Volpe had
answered it.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe denied his testimony was intended as revenge against Wiese
for first going to the authorities, or to save a friend. He said he
knew Schwarz only slightly, by his last name -- not as ''Chuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the attack, Volpe said he mistakenly thought Louima
had punched him during a disturbance outside a Haitian nightclub,
and became ''frustrated and angry'' when the arrested suspect
cursed him repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm not blaming Mr. Louima or trying to say it's his
fault. I was the one who assaulted him,'' Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, who testified for the first time last week about that
infamous August night, repeated his assertion that he was never in
the bathroom, and said he would not expect other cops to lie to
protect him, particularly Wiese, his patrol partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would never do something like that -- to ask a man with two
children to put himself in harm's way for me,'' Schwarz replied to
a question from his lawyer, Ronald Fischetti.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said he had only accompanied Louima from the patrol car
to the front desk of the precinct. At the time the assault, he
claimed to be outside conducting a routine search of the car for
possible contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who had escorted Louima from the desk to the bathroom,
Schwarz said, ''I think it was Tommy Wiese. I'm not 100 percent
sure, but I think it was him.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima testified that he could identify his second assailant
only as ''the driver'' who helped arrest him and transported him to
the station. Officials say Schwarz drove the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Louima also testified for the first time that he heard the
bathroom door open and close during the incident, suggesting
someone entered or left.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Approaches 5,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares led the Nasdaq composite
toward a first-time run at 5,000, but many stocks fell modestly
today as the market took a breather following last week's big
advance.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was up 57.14 at
4,971.93, working on another record high and closing in on 5,000
just two months after it first crossed 4,000 and four months after
it passed 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 78.49 at 10,288.71
after gaining 505 points last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other broad-market indexes were mixed, with the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 falling 8.71 to 1,400.46, as investors paused to plot
their next course after last week's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking at Babson
College today, said a slowing in the stock market's advance would
help keep the economy from growing too fast. But he also said the
economy's strong productivity gains could push the stock market
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was looking closely at Greenspan's comments,
searching for clues about the direction of interest rates, but the
Fed chairman didn't issue the dire warning that some investors
feared. The Fed has raised rates four times since last June in an
effort to ease the pace of economic growth and hold off inflation.
Last Friday, a report of moderating job growth offered one of the
first signs that the Fed is succeeding in its goal, bolstering
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, technology stocks were posting the sharpest gains.
Advanced Micro Devices rose 4 251/256 to 46~ on the New York Stock
Exchange amid news the company has begun shipping a computer chip
that can run at 1 gigahertz per second. Internet Capital Group
soared 26 11/16 to 145} after Banc Boston Robertson Stephens raised
its rating on the Web investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 ratio on the
New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq gainers led by a small
margin. The Russell 2000 index was up 5.57 at 603.45, adding to
Friday's record close.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 691.84 million shares, down sharply from
815.74 million at the same point on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Indiana on Good Friday  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court wants no say, not yet
anyway, in how states treat Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court Monday rejected a challenge to
Indiana's designation of Good Friday as a state holiday. The denial
of review, which was not accompanied by any court comment, allows
the state to continue giving its employees that day off, a practice
begun in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The designation had been attacked as a violation of the
constitutionally required separation of government and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The justices similarly turned away a challenge in January to a
Maryland law that requires the annual closing of all public schools
on Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Always two days before Easter, Good Friday is the Christian
holiday that commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus. But some courts
have ruled that designating the day as an annual holiday has a
legitimate, non-religious purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's law was challenged by taxpayer Russell Bridenbaugh of
Bloomington. His lawyers told the court that at least 14 other
states have laws making all or part of Good Friday a legal holiday.
</P>
<P>
   They are California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those laws have been struck down after being challenged
in court.
</P>
<P>
   After Bridenbaugh sued in 1997, a federal magistrate threw out
the case without a trial. A three-judge panel of the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal last July, by a 2-1
vote.
</P>
<P>
   A separate panel of that same appeals court previously had
struck down the Illinois law that provided for school closings on
each Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's main purpose in designating the state holiday is to
provide a long spring weekend, the appeals court panel found.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indiana does not celebrate the religious aspects of Good
Friday; for Indiana, the holiday has absolutely no religious
significance. To Indiana, Good Friday is nothing but a Friday
falling in the middle of the long vacationless spring -- a day which
employees should take off to rejuvenate themselves,'' the panel
said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting judge said the state should not be allowed to
choose Good Friday as the spring holiday every year. But the
two-judge majority noted that the designation gives state employees
a three-day weekend ''during a time which typically involves
travel, shopping, cooking and family gatherings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridenbaugh's appeal said the panel wrongly found that Good
Friday has been ''secularized'' by its linkage to Easter, which for
Christians commemorates Jesus' resurrection but also is associated
with the Easter bunny and egg hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good Friday is a purely religious holiday,'' the appeal said.

<HEADLINE> Clapton, Taylor, Raitt To Get Fame  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Clapton, whose solo career has veered
between pop hits and blues explorations, was set to join the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame for the third time Monday. His fellow
inductees included Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor and Earth, Wind &AMP;
Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Sixties hit-makers The Lovin' Spoonful, doo-wop pioneers The
Moonglows and embattled music executive Clive Davis were also to be
inducted in a ceremony at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire's Maurice White, who last week revealed his
battle with Parkinson's disease, was to make a rare appearance
performing with the band he founded.
</P>
<P>
   Clapton is already in the rock hall for his work as a member of
two groups, the Yardbirds and Cream.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the guitarist's solo career was being spotlighted.
His hits have spanned three decades, from ''After Midnight'' and
''Wonderful Tonight'' in the 1970s to the Grammy-winning ''Tears in
Heaven'' and ''Change the World'' in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He's kept current on the pop charts while not abandoning his
blues roots, which he explored on the ''From the Cradle'' album in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Blues-rocker Raitt was largely a cult favorite until her 10th
album, ''Nick of Time,'' won four Grammy Awards in 1989 and made
''Thing Called Love'' a hit. She started the Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Foundation to help older artists who didn't reap financial rewards
from their work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sweet Baby James'' Taylor was the quintessential 1970s
singer-songwriter with hits like ''Fire and Rain,'' ''How Sweet it
Is'' and ''Carolina in My Mind.'' He's still a major concert draw,
and now his children, Ben and Sally, have their own performing
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire favorites ''Shining Star'' and ''September''
are enjoying renewed popularity because of radio formats devoted to
1970s soul. White continues to record with the band but hasn't
toured since 1995 because of his Parkinson's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovin' Spoonful's string of mid-1960s hits included ''Do You
Believe in Magic?'' and ''Summer in the City.'' The Moonglows'
signature tune was ''Sincerely.''
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, who founded Arista Records and is now involved in a
public battle with Arista's owners to keep his job, the induction
is another well-timed salute. He guided the comeback of Carlos
Santana, who won eight Grammy Awards less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday were honored as
early influences on rock music.
</P>
<P>
   The names of Hall of Fame honorees are on exhibit at the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland.

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares led the Nasdaq composite
toward a first-time run at 5,000, but many stocks fell modestly
today as the market took a breather following last week's big
advance. In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was
up 29.68 at 4,944.47, working on another record high and closing in
on 5,000 just two months after it first crossed 4,000 and four
months after it passed 3,000. The Dow Jones industrial average was
down 125.96 at 10,241.24 after gaining 505 points last week. Other
broad-market indexes were mixed, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
falling 14.08 to 1,395.09, as investors paused to plot their next
course after last week's rally.

   MGM Grand, Mirage Reach $4.4B Deal
</P>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Casino owner MGM Grand Inc. reached a deal to
buy Mirage Resorts Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash today after
raising its initial offer for its rival. The deal announced today
will combine some of the most striking assets in the gambling
industry, including Mirage's $1.6 billion Bellagio resort and MGM's
5,005-room MGM Grand hotel-casino, the largest hotel in America. It
also involves two of the casino industry's most powerful figures,
Mirage chairman Steve Wynn and MGM majority stockholder Kirk
Kerkorian. Under the pact, MGM Grand will pay $21 a share for all
Mirage shares. That is up from its initial offer of $17 a share
that Mirage called inadequate.

   Greenspan Repeats Imbalance Worries
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's remarkable prosperity will be put
at risk unless supply and demand are brought into balance, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. Speaking at a Boston
College conference on the ''New Economy'' at Chestnut Hill, Mass.,
Greenspan voiced renewed concerns that the record-setting economy
was growing too rapidly given the dwindling supply of new workers
and the increasing need to rely on imported goods. Greenspan's
speech was likely to strengthen the belief of many economists that
the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates until it
sees greater evidence that the economy is slowing enough to keep
inflation under control.

gasoline prices are poised to surge to unprecedented levels before

Administration. It said U.S. gasoline stocks ''remain alarmingly
low'' and as far as the gasoline market is concerned the country
''is moving into uncharted territory.''

   Boeing Imposes Last Contract Offer

today. ''It's time to get back to work and start focusing on our
customers,'' Alan Mulally, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group
President, said yesterday. Charles Bofferding, executive director
of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace,
said today that the vast majority of workers remained on strike as
of this morning. He said he did not expect many workers would take
the company up on its offer.

   Lloyd's of London Fights Fraud Suit
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London took up the fight of its
312-year life today when lawyers began arguments in a lawsuit
accusing the company of massive fraud. Hundreds of Lloyd's
investors, known in the business as Names, allege they were duped
into joining the institution at a time when Lloyd's faced
overwhelming losses due to claims by victims of asbestos-related
illnesses. The Names argue that top Lloyd's executives knew about
these enormous liabilities but deliberately concealed them as they
launched a worldwide drive to recruit thousands of new investors to
help absorb the potential losses. Lloyd's lost $12.6 billion from
1988 to 1992, and many Names faced financial ruin. About 30 Names
committed suicide over a several-year span, unable to cope with
their share of the losses.

   Pearson PLC Earns Rise 15 Percent

   LONDON (AP) -- Pearson PLC, owner of the Financial Times and
other media companies, reported today that pretax earnings were up
15 percent in 1999 compared to the previous year, boosted by a
strong performance from its Penguin publishing unit. Pretax profits
for the year were 402 million pounds, or $635 million, compared to
350 million pounds in 1998. Sales were 3.3 billion pounds, or $5.2
billion, compared to 2.4 billion pounds a year earlier. Pearson
reported that operating profit was up 35 percent at its Penguin
book publishing subsidiary on a sales increase of 8 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Instead of hauling in promised big bucks,
Americans are losing millions of dollars by responding to phony
business opportunities touted in classified ads, government
authorities said Monday in announcing a wave of cases against such
promotions. The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department
and state attorneys general and securities officials have filed
complaints against 68 operations they accuse of deceiving people
about work-at-home and other business ventures, such as renting out
vending machines. To raise awareness, more than 100 newspapers have
agreed to publish classified ads informing consumers of what to
look for in legitimate business promotions, officials said.

Tridex 2000 Defense Exhibition here. The contract had been under

   Qwest Confirms Other Merger Talks
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Qwest Communications Inc. has acknowledged that
its executives have been holding talks with a major
telecommunications company about a deal to acquire both Qwest and U
S West Inc., a Denver-based Baby Bell. Qwest, which agreed in July
to acquire U S West for $56 billion, issued a statement Sunday
night confirming the discussions without naming the company, which
is reportedly Germany-based Deutsche Telekom AG. U S West, which
was kept in the dark about the negotiations, threatened on Friday
to sue Qwest if the company backed out of its contract. The fact
that Qwest was discussing a deal with another company raises
questions about whether Qwest breached its agreement with U S West.

   Japan Expects 2 Percent Growth
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top economic planner said today that the
nation's economy will grow 2 percent in the fiscal year starting
April 1, 2001, boosted by a long-awaited recovery in consumer
spending. Taichi Sakaiya, head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency,
added that growth in consumer demand, industrial output and
machinery orders since January will likely carry through and help
the economy grow 1 percent in the fiscal year that starts this
April 1. Japan's economy, hurt by near record-high unemployment and
falling wages, is just beginning to show signs of emerging from in
its longest slump in decades.

<HEADLINE> Rates Rise at Treasury Auction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department sold $9 billion in three-month bills at
a discount rate of 5.690 percent, up from 5.670 percent last week.
An additional $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of
5.825 percent, up from 5.765 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month rate was the highest since May 22, 1995, when
the bills sold for 5.72 percent. The six-month rate was the highest
since May 1, 1995, when the rate was 5.84.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 5.852 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,856.20 and 6.085 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,705.50.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 6.18
percent last week from 6.22 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Residents of 24-Hour Show Get Break  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Residents on a 24-hour German TV show will now be
able to duck from the omnipresent cameras' range, the producers of
the ''Big Brother'' series agreed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, media regulators meeting in Munich postponed a decision
until March 14 on whether to order the show off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire for violating residents' dignity, the show's
producers said they would set up a camera-free room in the house
where residents could spend an hour a day in privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The show is based on a series of the same name in the
Netherlands, where cameras and microphones monitor five men and
five women for 100 days, 24 hours a day -- even in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared cameras observe residents when the lights are off in
the two communal bedrooms, and there also is a camera in the toilet
-- though producers say it's there only for security.
</P>
<P>
   The audience periodically gets the chance to vote to kick
someone out of the house, and the person left at the end wins
$125,000.
</P>
<P>
   A nightly broadcast airs highlights from the day, and viewers
can watch the house live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians and officials have criticized the program on
private network RTL II for offending ''human dignity,'' a value
protected in Germany's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   One woman voluntarily left the house Sunday. Despina, 29, said
she wasn't feeling well and was unhappy and feeling stress from
living in the house, located outside Cologne. She had even hung a
curtain so the cameras couldn't watch her undress.
</P>
<P>
   From the first broadcast Wednesday night, when 3.3 million tuned
in, the audience has steadily dropped to about 2.2 million on
Sunday, or about one in 37 Germans.
</P>
<P>
   That's far below the average one in 15 Dutch people who watched
the show nightly in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Three officers convicted in cover-up of police-station torture  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ten days after the widely debated acquittal in
the police shooting of an unarmed black man, three white officers
were convicted Monday of a cover-up in the 1997 torture of a
Haitian immigrant in the bathroom of a Brooklyn police station
</P>
<P>
   A jury deliberated four days before finding ex-patrolman Charles
Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Wiese, 36, and Thomas Bruder, 33,
guilty of lying to investigators to conceal Schwarz's role in one
of the most notorious cases of police brutality in city history.
The penalty on the obstruction of justice charge is up to five
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz already was in custody facing a possible life sentence
for his 1999 conviction on violating Louima's civil rights by
holding down the handcuffed prisoner as fellow Officer Justin Volpe
sodomized him with a broken-off broom handle. In the second case,
prosecutors sought to show police hid behind a so-called ''blue
wall of silence'' after the Aug. 9, 1997, assault.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict -- coming in the wake of an Albany jury's acquittal
of four officers who killed Amadou Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets --
triggered an emotional outburst by the defendants and their
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London, suggested the outcome of the
Diallo case and the flood of protests and public debate that
followed may have put pressure on the anonymous jury in the
Brooklyn case, which was composed of six blacks, five whites and
one Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to ignore the post-Diallo, anti-police climate that
resides in this city,'' London said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was led out of the courtroom, Schwarz could be heard
loudly cursing. Wiese and Bruder, who are still free on $100,000
bail, both wept. Wiese later cradled his mother after she
apparently collapsed in a hallway outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''You tell the truth and this is what happens,'' Bruder ranted.
''I'll be fine; nobody's stronger than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for all three men said they would appeal. Schwarz
attorney Ron Fischetti also said he asked that Schwarz be placed on
a suicide watch in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all should be put on suicide watch,'' said Schwarz's wife,
Andra. ''We're all in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima was not in the courtroom for the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Abner Louima wants more than anything else is for what
happened to him to never happen to anyone else's children,''
Sanford Rubenstein, an attorney representing the Louima family,
said outside the courthouse. The family has filed a $155 million
lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Said Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad: ''Justice was done
in that courtroom today.'' Referring to Schwarz's decision to take
the stand in his own defense, he added, ''I thought essentially his
testimony was a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Vinegrad accused the three defendants of telling ''lie
after lie'' to save Schwarz. He offered phone records as evidence
that the cops, who rarely spoke prior to the incident, had scores
of conversations in the weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's dramatic highlights were provided by Volpe, as the
first defense witness, and Schwarz as the last. Both contended that
Schwarz was never in the 70th Precinct lavatory during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, serving 30 years after pleading guilty to attacking
Louima, was subpoenaed from prison to tell his story under oath for
the first time. He testified that Wiese was present, but made no
move to join the assault or try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never saw Schwarz in the bathroom at any time,'' Volpe told
the jury, adding that he could not serve his time ''with a clear
conscience ... knowing that another man is paying for the crime
that I committed.''
</P>
<P>
   That differed sharply from Wiese's own version, given to
detectives shortly after the incident. Wiese said he entered the
bathroom to find Volpe standing over Louima, stick in hand, and
then dragged the victim to safety by his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said he mistakenly thought Louima had punched him during a
disturbance outside a Haitian nightclub, and became ''frustrated
and angry'' when the arrested suspect cursed him repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz repeated his claim he was never in the bathroom. He said
he would not expect other cops to lie to protect him, particularly
Wiese, his patrol partner.
</P>
<P>
   The former officer said he had only accompanied Louima from the
patrol car to the front desk of the precinct. At the time of the
assault, he claimed to be outside conducting a routine search of
his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   As in the first trial, Louima testified that he could identify
his second assailant only as ''the driver'' who transported him to
the station. Officials say Schwarz drove the patrol car.

<HEADLINE> The Women Behind the Contenders  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cindy McCain, Tipper Gore and Ernestine Bradley are known as the
charismatic campaigners, the ones who look as comfortable on the
stump as their husbands. But Laura Bush can hold her own, too.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing her husband at a recent appearance, she used the
chance to catch him up on things at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''First, I can report to George and to you that the girls got
off to school just fine this morning, and I fed the cats before I
left,'' she said, as the audience laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The five candidates' wives -- Jocelyn Marcel Keyes, the fifth,
runs a soup kitchen in Montgomery County, Md. -- have plenty in
common as the spouses of men running hard for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Where they differ is in approach.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain is the bright-eyed daughter of an Arizona beer
distributor, while Tipper Gore bubbles like a school girl still
fawning over her college sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley, a native German, makes audiences laugh with
occasional slips like saying she opposes the military's ''don't
talk, don't tell'' policy toward gay soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush is more reserved, reflecting her past as a public
school librarian. Jocelyn Keyes is often away from the presidential
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Mrs. Bush was asked what type of first lady she'd be
if her husband, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, were elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Would she be like her mother-in-law, former first lady Barbara
Bush? Or perhaps like Hillary Rodham Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   In an answer similar in tone to all of her fellow spouses, she
said: ''I'll just be Laura Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain, married to Sen. John McCain, says that on the
campaign trail, ''My first and foremost role is to protect my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the one who gets cranky when the schedule is too long, the
day is too long, he's not fed properly and I feel like he's being
pulled in too many directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, snaps pictures from
the stage at campaign events for the family photo album. After an
early important win, she grabbed the microphone and yelled: ''New
Hampshire, you rock!''
</P>
<P>
   Her public warmth helps offset his famously stiff demeanor. When
she introduces him, he has his arm around her and she puts her hand
on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley is upbeat on the trail, in contrast to her
more somber husband, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   A professor at Montclair State University in New Jersey who
specializes in the Holocaust, she can charm crowds with her
intellect, light accent and occasional malapropisms.
</P>
<P>
   She spots people in the crowd who have met Bill and gives them a
long hug, reminding him to say hello. She gets some of her biggest
applause by good-naturedly putting him in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill is really a very sweet husband,'' she said, ''but he
always forgets to introduce me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush often stays in the background, napping while her
husband speaks with reporters on a campaign plane or sitting
quietly by his side at news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keyes, the wife of Alan Keyes, on some days ladles out soup
and dispenses advice at the soup kitchen she runs. Usually, though,
she's at home, raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with the children is a major question for full-time
candidates and their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Cindy McCain said she made the decision to go
almost full-time on the campaign trail recently ''because it's very
important that I'm with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family life is now on public display, as she disciplines the
kids via cellphone with people on the bus listening in. She
compares notes on child-raising techniques with members of the
press pool who are also parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''How is he doing this morning? How was his night?'' she asked
her housekeeper about a sick child recently, clutching her
cellphone tight to her ear.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Laura Bush has stayed closer to home. She and
her husband have twin 18-year-old daughters, both of whom are in
the midst of applying to college.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our girls are seniors and we're both already sort of teary
about the thought of them leaving,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not with her husband, she still keeps up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm not with George I'm much more anxious about the
campaign than when I'm on the trip with him,'' she said. ''And I
think that's why I call in during the day to see what's
happening.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors subpoena New Jersey donors in Torricelli campaignprobe  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A U.S. Justice Department task force
investigating fund-raising abuses in U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli's
1996 campaign has subpoenaed some of New Jersey's top Democratic
fund-raisers, a Justice Department official and Torricelli's lawyer
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli attorney Abbe Lowell said Justice Department
officials assured him that the senator is not a focus of the
investigation that has led to three convictions of his contributors
and indictments of another contributor and his aide over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the subpoenas focus new attention on a campaign that helped
Torricelli win a national post raising money for Democratic
senatorial candidates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old senator is chairman of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, a position he won partly because of the $9.2
million he was able to raise in 1996 for his victory over Rep.
Richard A. Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the committee helped close the gap in soft
money donations with Senate Republicans, raising $11.7 million in
1999 to the Republicans' $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Between 12 and 15 prominent New Jersey donors who were ''somehow
connected to the Torricelli campaign'' received subpoenas last
Thursday, said a Justice Department official who insisted on
anonymity. The official didn't know if all those subpoenaed had
made contributions to Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Torricelli is not a focus of the campaign
investigation, and that the department planned to conduct
interviews and request documents from the donors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those documents include records of contributions to the
Clinton-Gore Coordinated Campaign Fund of 1996, which raised money
for the Democratic presidential campaign and several New Jersey
congressional races, Lowell said. He said he was left with the
impression that Justice Department officials were completing the
investigation of the Torricelli campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been told that there is no evidence that any
(Torricelli) campaign worker was involved in any campaign
violation,'' Lowell said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Torricelli declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas ask donors to surrender all correspondence with
Torricelli and his campaign, records of contributions, and records
showing whether any contributions were rejected because they failed
to comply with federal limits, The New York Times reported in its
Monday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to learn whether fund-raisers and
Torricelli campaign staffers encouraged a practice known as conduit
financing, in which a donor evades the $1,000 federal limit on
campaign donations by funneling money through others, The
Star-Ledger of Newark reported on Monday, citing an unidentified
source familiar with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said he conducted an internal inquiry of Torricelli's
campaign staff to determine whether that occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only did that not happen, but the opposite happened,'' he
said. ''People went out of their way to make sure that the campaign
rules were followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Three donors have admitted in federal court to making conduit
contributions. Federal prosecutors have also charged David Chang,
one of the nation's largest political donors, with obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Berek Paul Don, a former Bergen County Republican
leader, admitted illegally donating $11,000 through other employees
in his office, and said that Chang asked him to get the money to
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Carmine R. Alampi, Don's former law partner and former Bergen
County Democratic Party treasurer, admitted in December to making
$2,000 in illegal contributions, using money he said Don told him
was from Chang.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Penna admitted in October to funneling $20,000 in
illegal donations to Torricelli's campaign and $12,000 to the
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chang was charged in December with conspiring with a business
aide, Audrey Yu, to obstruct the task force investigation by
destroying records from one of his companies.

<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Irish drug developer Elan Corp. PLC said
Monday it has agreed to acquire The Liposome Co. Inc. for $575
million in stock, or $15.28 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Elan said the deal is part of its expansion into the cancer
treatment business. It hopes to get approval to sell Liposome's
Evacet cancer drug outside the United States. Last September, a
federal regulatory panel didn't approve Evacet for use in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Liposome's sales come from AbelcetR, a drug used to
treat severe fungal infections. AbelcetR generated $86.2 million of
Liposome's $92.5 million in 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   If the European Union approves Evacet and the drug reaches
certain sales targets, Elan will pay the Princeton drug maker an
additional $98 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Liposome is to operate as a separate business
unit. It is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Breast Milk May Make Babies Smarter  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Enriching bottle formula with two essential
fatty acids found in mother's milk can cause a significant
improvement in the mental development of babies, a new study says.
</P>
<P>
   The supplemented formula does not assure intellectual genius,
said researchers at the Retina Foundation of the Southwest in
Dallas, but the study does show that adding the fatty acids to
bottled formula can closely mimic the effect of mother's milk on
brain development.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the study, published in the journal Developmental
Medicine and Child Neurology, is important because it is the first
to compare formula supplemented with the fatty acids with formula
without the additions. Earlier studies compared straight formula
with mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   The study adds to growing international support for adding to
commercial baby formula two fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
and arachidonic acid (AA), that are in breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 countries have approved supplementing formula with
the DHA and AA. Officials at the Food and Drug Administration said
the issue is under review and new regulations for U.S. formula
makers may be issued within eight months.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers divided 56 newborns into three groups
and fed them different formula for four months.
</P>
<P>
   A control group received a commercial formula with no addition.
One test group got formula supplemented with DHA, while the third
group got both DHA and AA. At the end of four months, all three
groups began receiving only commercial formula.
</P>
<P>
   At age 18 months, the children were tested on the Bayley Scales
of Infant Development, a standard test used to gauge physical and
mental progress of infants. A score of 100 is considered the
national average for mental development.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen E. Birch, first author of the study, said infants
receiving the double supplement, both DHA and AA, scored 105.6 on
the mental development index of the Bayley Scales.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said this is virtually identical to the 106 score of a
separate group of babies, in another study, who were breast fed
only.
</P>
<P>
   For the control group of infants, who received commercial
formula, the average score was 98. This is within the statistical
range of normal, but seven points below the average for the test
group.
</P>
<P>
   For the group that received formula supplemented only with DHA,
said Birch, the score was about 102, a statistically insignificant
difference from normal.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said that although the infants on supplemented formula
scored significantly higher than the control group, the study does
not prove that there will be a similar IQ difference when the
children are older.
</P>
<P>
   ''The test is not a perfect predictor of school age
intelligence,'' said Birch. ''It does provide a good profile of
mental development at the early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Children in the study will be tested again at age 4 and 9 to
determine if the enhanced early brain development translates into
higher IQs among school-age children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said she thought the FDA was being ''appropriately
cautious'' in its evaluation of the DHA and AA supplemented
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still some important questions to be answered''
regarding the long-term effect of artificially supplementing
formula with the fatty acids, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is always caution when you are adding something to baby
formula,'' said Christine Lewis, director of the FDA's office of
nutritional products. ''We are reviewing it actively, but this is a
serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Levine, a nutritional researcher at Rockefeller
University in New York, said the Birch study ''is a great, giant
step'' because it was a direct comparison of supplemented and
straight formula.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said there were many studies showing the superiority of
breast milk for infants and that the goal has been to fortify
formula ''so that it is like breast milk.''
</P>
<P>
   More research on DHA and AA are appropriate, said Levine, but
use of the two fatty acids in baby formula ''is very, very
promising.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Heads Toward 5,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares led the Nasdaq composite
toward a first-time run at 5,000, but blue-chip shares fell sharply
amid profit-taking from last week's big advance.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, Nasdaq was up 23.47 at
4,938.26, working on another record high and closing in on 5,000
just two months after it first crossed 4,000 and four months after
it passed 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 140.08 at 10,227.12
after gaining 505 points last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other broad-market indexes were mixed, with the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 falling 15.17 to 1,394.00, as many investors paused to
plot their course after last week's rally.
</P>
<P>
   There was little market reaction as Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan delivered a speech that reinforced expectations the
Fed will keep raising interest rates to slow the economy and stave
off inflation. However, there were no dire warnings as some
investors had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, speaking at a Boston College conference in Chestnut
Hill, Mass., noted that higher borrowing costs for businesses were
prompting many analysts to predict a slowdown in the stock market's
advance. Still, he added, strong productivity gains could still
push the stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed already has raised rates four times since last June.
Last Friday, a report of moderating job growth offered one of the
first signs that the Fed is succeeding in its goal, bolstering
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, technology stocks were posting the sharpest gains.
Advanced Micro Devices rose 5 203/256 to 46 15/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange amid news the company has begun shipping a computer
chip that can run at 1 gigahertz per second. In Nasdaq trading,
Internet Capital Group soared 25 19/16 to 144 23/64 after Banc
Boston Robertson Stephens raised its rating on the Web investment
company.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 ratio on the
New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq gainers led by a small
margin. The Russell 2000 index was up 3.62 at 601.50, adding to
Friday's record close.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 820.93 million shares, down sharply from
945.49 million at the same point on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Canonization papers sent to Rome  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Local Roman Catholic Church leaders on
Monday closed a two-year investigation they say shows a New Haven
priest who founded the Knights of Columbus should be made a saint.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony steeped in ritual and formality, nearly 800 pages
of documentation on the life of the Rev. Michael J. McGivney were
packaged and sealed to be sent to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   If canonized, McGivney would be the first parish priest from the
United States to become a saint and one of only a handful of
Americans to be so exalted.
</P>
<P>
   The three bundles of documents, each about 10 inches thick, were
bound in red and gold ribbon, placed in tissue-lined boxes, wrapped
in brown paper and then tied with white string. Wax was dripped
from candles to seal the packages.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a moment of historical significance for the
Archdiocese of Hartford and indeed the entire church in North
America,'' said the Most Rev. Daniel Cronin, archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   As a 29-year-old priest at St. Mary's in New Haven more than a
century ago, McGivney surely never dreamed of such an honor, said
Rev. Gabriel O'Donnell, the lead researcher in the cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1882, McGivney -- the son of a Waterbury factory
worker -- sought to create a group that would strengthen the
Catholic faith while providing for families affected by death or
serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   His idea has grown into the Knights of Columbus, a fraternal
organization with 1.6 million members around the world. A program
he began to support widows and orphans -- in which each member gave
$1 to the family of a deceased member -- has evolved into the
insurance program the Knights of Columbus runs today.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really ahead of his time involving laity,'' said Virgil
Dechant, Supreme Knight of the organization still based in New
Haven. ''We're still involved in his crusade, working for the needs
of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell will deliver the papers to Rome later this week for
the first of several tests the cause must pass. There, the
Congregation for the Causes of the Saints -- the administrative
staff of the pope -- will review the documents and determine whether
to continue considering McGivney for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the archdiocese must investigate -- and try to prove --
reports of miracles attributed to McGivney. O'Donnell said he has
received letters from around the world from people who believe
their prayers to McGivney have been answered.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Donnell leaves the documents in Rome, the cause will be
out of his hands. It could be weeks, months or years before a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Vatican gets thousands of these requests. Some never get
farther than this,'' O'Donnell said. ''But Rev. McGivney is a good
candidate. ... He is not a man who lived in an ivory tower. He
believed the ordinary man could be holy.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices rallied higher Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid unseasonably warm weather in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Corn led the gains, as record high temperatures heightened
concern about dry soil as the spring growing season approaches. The
soil in corn-growing states has been unusually dry since last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The upside was limited by forecasts for rain in key growing
areas as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans also had a strong increase, thanks in part to
stronger-than-expected export inspection figures released by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices were supported by technical buying and the rally in
soybeans, although storm systems bearing down on the winter wheat
belt and expected to produce rain later this week pressured the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose 2{ cents to $2.60{ a bushel; May
corn rose 3\ cents to $2.28} a bushel; May oats rose \ cent to
$1.18} a bushel; May soybeans rose 4\ cents to $5.17\ a bushel.

   Beef futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork
futures rose.

   April live cattle fell .12 cent to 72.85 cents a pound; April
feeder cattle fell .13 cent to 84.82 cents a pound; April lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Nine West Settles Charges for $34M  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nine West Group Inc., one of the nation's
largest suppliers of women's shoes, settled a price-fixing case
Monday by agreeing to pay states $34 million and stop dictating
what stores charge for its footwear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in 56 U.S.
states and territories had alleged that the company violated
antitrust laws stipulating when retailers could offer shoes at
reduced prices and distributing lists of shoes that could not be
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West sells shoes under such brand names as Nine West,
Amalfi, Bandolino, 9 &AMP; Co., Calico, Easy Spirit, Evan-Picone,
Pappagallo, Capezio, Calvin Klein, Selby, and Enzo Angiolini.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ''sends a strong signal to companies that fixing
resale prices violates the law and will result in enforcement
actions,'' said Richard G. Parker, director of the FTC's Bureau of
Competition.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers who did not adhere to Nine West policies were
threatened with cancellations, denied orders or were not given
discounts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, competition among retailers selling Nine West
brands was restricted and the price of the company's shoes were
kept artificially high, the FTC's complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Nine West, based in White Plains, N.Y., said the
settlement was not an admission of liability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that this was the most efficient manner in which to
resolve this issue, avoiding substantial legal expense and
management time,'' said Jacki Nemerov, president of Jones Apparel
Group, which acquired Nine West last summer. The alleged price
fixing occurred between January 1998 and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company entered into two separate settlements, one with the
attorneys general of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana
Islands and Guam. The other is with the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC settlement prohibits Nine West from setting the price at
which retailers can advertise, promote or sell shoes or coercing
retailers to stick to any one price. The company also cannot notify
dealers in advance that they are subject to suspension if they sell
Nine West shoes below a designated price. Nine West must also
notify its dealers that they have the right to set the price for
the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the states requires a payment of $34 million.
Of this, no more than $3.5 million will cover attorney's fees,
while the rest will be used to fund women's health, educational,
vocational and safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was filed in U.S. District Court in New York
immediately after a lawsuit was filed against Nine West in the same
court. The agreement resolves the suit, but gives the court
jurisdiction over the terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''When even one business won't play by the rules and illegally
overcharges its customers, everybody gets hurts,'' said South
Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon. He is proposing that the
state use its portion of the money to assist rape victims and
crisis pregnancy centers.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Government on Tankers  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States generally cannot set their own safety
standards meant to prevent oil spills from tankers, except when
they address unique local waterway conditions, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling said a federal law enacted after the
massive 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska pre-empts several
rules enacted by Washington state regarding tanker staffing and
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Uniform national rules regarding general tanker design,
operation and seaworthiness have been mandated'' by federal law,
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state of Washington has enacted legislation in an area
where the federal interest has been manifest since the beginning of
our republic and is now well established,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke called the decision ''a major setback
for states that want to take prudent steps to prevent oil-spill
catastrophes. Under this ruling, oil-spill protection for the
entire nation will be set at the lowest common denominator, with no
recognition that some marine habitats deserve a higher level of
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled for the Clinton administration, which argued
that Washington state's rules for staffing and operation of
oceangoing tankers upset the federal government's authority to
adopt uniform national rules.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows states to set liability rules for pollution
caused by oil spills, Kennedy noted.
</P>
<P>
   And states can regulate their own ports and waterways, so long
as the rules are based on ''the peculiarities of local waters'' and
do not conflict with federal rules, he said. But it is up to the
Coast Guard to regulate the design, construction, maintenance,
staffing and operation of tanker vessels, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled that Washington state rules on tanker crew
training, English-language proficiency, navigation watch
requirements and accident reporting affected operations outside
state waters and therefore were superseded by federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   They ordered a lower court to consider whether federal law
pre-empts other Washington state rules, including one involving
watch requirements during limited-visibility times.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that said
states could adopt their own rules for oil-tanker operations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act a year after the Exxon
Valdez drove onto a charted reef and dumped about 11 million
gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law said it does not pre-empt states ''from imposing
any additional liability or requirements'' regarding oil discharges
within their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Washington state officials adopted standards for
training, language, staffing and drug-testing of oil tanker crews.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were challenged in federal court by the International
Association of Independent Tanker Owners, known as Intertanko.
</P>
<P>
   A judge upheld the rules. After the federal government joined
Intertanko's appeal, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
the state rules on staffing and operation of oil tankers. That
decision was reversed by the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Bonwit Teller Closes Last Store  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Bonwit Teller, a once-gilded Fifth Avenue
retailer rescued from bankruptcy by The Pyramid Cos., said Monday
it is closing its last store, ending nearly a century of business.
</P>
<P>
   Bonwit Teller did not open its store Monday in the Pyramid-owned
Carousel Center mall.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which employs 60 people, will begin a
going-out-of-business sale Thursday, said Murray Daitchman,
Bonwit's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The 62,000 square foot store, one of five anchor tenants in the
giant mall, will be replaced by a collection of new ''lifestyle''
stores. Pyramid executives said the store's lush interior, with its
elegant decor and muraled ceilings, will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Decade-long ''operating inefficiencies'' of the store, coupled
with Pyramid's plans to put more stores inside the mall, forced
Pyramid and Bonwit to close the store, said Daitchman.
</P>
<P>
   Bonwit Teller's demise was not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse-based Pyramid Cos. paid $8 million in cash in 1990
for the once-glitzy Bonwit Teller name and two of its stores in
Buffalo and Boston after the retailer went bankrupt. Later that
same year, Pyramid opened a new Bonwit Teller store in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to expand the Bonwit Teller store name throughout
Pyramid's other two dozen malls plus a new flagship store in
Manhattan never materialized. The Boston and Buffalo stores
eventually were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being one of the most successful regional mall
developers in the nation, Pyramid could not transfer that success
to the retailing business.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1902, Bonwit Teller was the first retailer in the
United States to import designer clothing from Europe. It also was
the first U.S. retailer to open a designer section for men in its
stores.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, Bonwit Teller was at the pinnacle in American
fashion with its upscale store on Fifth Avenue, where customers
could buy Louis Feraud dresses, Bruno Magli shoes and Fendi
handbags. At its peak, the chain had 16 stores.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper War Breaks Out in Seattle  </HEADLINE>
By PEGGY ANDERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- With a bold, red ''Good Morning!'' across the top
of the front page, the Seattle Times made its debut as a morning
newspaper Monday, going head-to-head with its crosstown rival, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The lead story in both newspapers was the 26-day-old engineers
strike at Boeing Co., the Seattle-based airplane manufacturer. Both
papers also featured front-page messages about their direct
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper war is the first between publications that have a
joint-operating agreement. Such cost-saving agreements allow
newspapers to share some business operations but keep their news
departments separate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great!'' said Times Executive Editor Michael R.
Fancher. He urged readers to appraise the two newspapers, confident
that ''there's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a great day to take both newspapers and place them
side by side,'' agreed Ken Bunting, executive editor at the
Post-Intelligencer. ''I think we do well with that comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Fancher noted that he and Bunting ''are not enemies by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're decent people,'' he said. ''Having said that, we want to
go out and crush them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times had been the only afternoon newspaper to dominate in a
major U.S. newspaper market, and the switch to morning publication
recognized a national preference presumably shared by the many
newcomers to the booming Pacific Northwest. The
Post-Intelligencer's morning time slot gave it a delivery advantage
in outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp.'s Post-Intelligencer -- a presence here since
1863 -- has undergone a $4.7 million newsroom overhaul, with a new
computer system, and expanded its editorial staff by 20 to 210.
</P>
<P>
   The Times -- a Blethen family enterprise since 1896 that is 49.5
percent owned by Knight Ridder -- is maintaining its editorial staff
at about 300.
</P>
<P>
   The Times has 220,000 subscribers, while the Post-Intelligencer
has 191,000. About 500,000 readers take the combined Sunday
edition, to which the Post-Intelligencer contributes three pages.
Only 8,000 people subscribe to both papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Times tried a morning edition in the early 1980s -- alongside
its evening paper -- and had about 50,000 subscribers for it when
the JOA was signed in 1983. The morning paper was scrapped under
the pact approved by the U.S. Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Just call us 'PNC,' bankers say  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY BAIR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Stir another three letters into the alphabet
soup of corporate names such as TWA, MGM, CVS and CSX.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said Monday that the financial services company
formerly known as Pittsburgh National Bank, PNC Financial Corp. and
most recently PNC Bank Corp. will be called just ''PNC'' starting
with an ad campaign March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the nation's 14th-largest bank want to build a
brand name associated with not only banking but also PNC's
mortgage, asset management, trust and other businesses, Chairman
Thomas O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The word ''bank'' in the name, representing PNC's 721 branches
in the Midwest and Northeast, threw people off, according to a
consultant who worked with PNC on the change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Labeling it as a bank always related people's thoughts to the
regional banking franchise,'' said James Cerruti, a managing
director at The FutureBrand Co. in New York. ''They have created a
broad-based player, and it is important to convey that and to
capture that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''PNC'' stands for nothing but partly reflects the names of both
Pittsburgh National and Philadelphia-based Provident National,
which merged in 1983. The new corporate name, ''PNC Financial
Services Group,'' will stay in the background, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People would say, 'PNC Bank -- that's that bank in Pittsburgh.'
Well, over 50 percent of our business is national,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   PNC has the nation's eighth-largest network of automated teller
machines and ranks among the top three companies in issuing
mortgage-backed securities, its executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Ads with the name and new triangle logo will run in the New York
Times and Wall Street Journal. Bank branch signs around the
Northeast and Midwest will be changed during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just using 'PNC' is advantageous because it takes the name
'bank' out of the advertising,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking
analyst with Tucker Anthony in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But building a national brand ''is going to take a while,''
Cassidy said. ''They have failed at trying to roll out a national
banking product. But they've done phenomenally well with their
national investment product.''
</P>
<P>
   A folksy mockup commercial for PNC by Arnold Communications of
Washington, D.C., shows people either relaxing or making money.
Elements of that spot will be used in PNC's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The ad starts with, ''Money has no soul -- it can't tell you what
to do,'' and ends with, ''Finally, money has an owner's manual --
PNC.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our customers see us not as the get-rich-quick dot-com, nor as
the old style of coming in and letting us manage your money for
you. It's more in between,'' said Denise Thorne Johnson, PNC's vice
president for marketing.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Bob Jones Dating Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- In a March 3 story about Bob Jones
University dropping its ban on interracial dating, The Associated
Press erroneously reported that the school began admitting black
students after it lost its tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service moved to revoke the school's
tax-exempt status in 1970, on grounds that it discriminated by
refusing to admit black students and by banning interracial dating.
The school then began admitting black students, but the IRS said
the dating policy still constituted discrimination. The school
fought the IRS action in court and did not actually forfeit its
tax-exempt status until 1983.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Execs Back Bush  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Still angry about John McCain's votes against
limiting lawsuits and his effort to reduce a key tax deduction,
some Silicon Valley executives have told the Republican Party they
won't back the Arizona senator if he is the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very difficult to see how he would get support,'' said
Floyd Kwamme, a partner at the venture capital firm of Kleiner
Perkins Caulfield &AMP; Byers. ''I would be very worried if he were the
Republican candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwamme, who said he expected many executives now aligned with
George W. Bush to back Democrats Al Gore or Bill Bradley before
McCain, is a member of Bush's California steering committee. But
others have strong feelings, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question there is enormous support for Bush,'' said
Lezlee Westine, general counsel and vice president of Technet, a
group of senior high-tech executives that raises money for favored
candidates. ''He's good on our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has championed education reform, and led a successful
campaign in Texas to limit lawsuits, two top priorities of the
high-tech community.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on the other hand, has angered high-tech executives on
several occasions. In 1995, he was one of just four Republican
senators to support President Clinton's veto of legislation
restricting shareholder lawsuits. And McCain has introduced
legislation to eliminate the full corporate tax deductibility for
certain stock options, a major enticement to workers in the
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain spokesman Dan McLagan said the senator had plenty
of support in high-technology offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''High-tech executives are enthusiastic about Senator McCain's
plan to make the ban on Internet taxation permanent, which would,
of course, create high-tech jobs and grow the economy,'' McLagan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cultivated Silicon Valley even before announcing his
presidential campaign. A member of his campaign staff serves as a
liaison to the high-tech community. Executives have made regular
visits to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts have paid off. Among Bush's supporters are Cisco
Systems Chief Executive Officer John Chambers, Oracle President Ray
Lane and Intel CEO Craig Barrett. And Bush raised $1.1 million from
the computer and venture capital industries through Jan. 31, to
$244,876 for McCain. Bush supporters in Silicon Valley are using
e-mail to try to turn out the vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore raised $431,850 from the computer
and venture capital industries, while Bradley raised $430,450.

<HEADLINE> Envoy Ross Returning to Mideast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross plans to return
to the Middle East in hopes of persuading Israel and the
Palestinians to resume discussions that broke off last month.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Foley said Ross, who returned
from the region a week ago, was expected to go back before midweek.
</P>
<P>
   When Ross left the region last week, he said he was going to
consult with President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are deadlocked over the location of
an overdue Israeli withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank.
The Palestinians want to receive Jerusalem suburbs, a position that
Israel has refused. They also object to Israel's plan to fold an
additional troop withdrawal into a final peace treaty, slated for
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse has produced recriminations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the United States wants to see settlements between
Israel and all of its neighbors -- Lebanon, Syria and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is our aim, our overarching goal, an ambitious and
difficult agenda for the year 2000, and we're hard at work on it on
all fronts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States believes that ''an Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon, in the context of such a settlement,
particularly between Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon, would
be the best outcome. ''

<HEADLINE> New War Crime Case Evidence Found  </HEADLINE>
By EUGENE BRCIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A search of Croatian government archives
has uncovered evidence that could vindicate a Bosnian Croat general
convicted by an international tribunal of atrocities against
Bosnian Muslims, Croatia's prime minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Tihomir Blaskic was sentenced to 45 years in prison Friday
for ordering an ethnic purging campaign of Muslim villages in
central Bosnia that left hundreds dead and forced thousands to flee
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence shocked many in Croatia, including Prime Minister
Ivica Racan's newly-elected pro-Western government, which has
pledged unconditional compliance with the U.N. war crimes tribunal
in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Racan said a search of government archives had uncovered
''documents which throw greater light on wartime events in Bosnia
from 1992 to 1994, and call into question the severity of the
verdict against Gen. Blaskic.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the evidence would be submitted to the war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, Racan referred specifically to Ahmici, the
village where soldiers under Blaskic's alleged command massacred
scores of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears (the documents) repudiate arguments that brought
about the ruling and can identify the true perpetrators of
atrocities, including those in Ahmici,'' Racan said.
</P>
<P>
   Racan said he believed Blaskic's sentence was unduly harsh,
considering that Blaskic surrendered voluntarily to the court and
did not actively participate in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Racan said he did not know why the former nationalist
government, led by the late President Franjo Tudjman, did not
submit the archived material to investigators earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts have speculated the documents were
deliberately withheld because they could incriminate Tudjman and
his senior associates, who have often expressed aspirations toward
territory in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic's attorney, Ante Nobilo, expressed satisfaction with the
new government's decision to search the state archives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have tried unsuccessfully for years to gain access to
government archives,'' Nobilo, told the state-run HINA news agency,
adding that he hoped the newly discovered material would help an
appeal now being planned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of war veterans protested Blaskic's
conviction outside the U.S. Embassy on Monday. After holding
speeches and hurling some eggs at the embassy building, the crowd
moved to parliament, where they accused the new government of
bending to Western demands for cooperation with the U.N. court.

<HEADLINE> New Breast Reconstruction Procedure  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer stole Jane Culbreath's breast. Two
tries at breast implants failed.
</P>
<P>
   And when doctors considered rebuilding her breast using her own
tissue, it turned out that at 101 pounds, Culbreath didn't have
enough fat to spare.
</P>
<P>
   But her otherwise identical twin sister did. So in a medical
first, a tummy tuck for one sister provided enough fat and skin to
build the other a new breast.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect fat donations to become common.
</P>
<P>
   But a few doctors have begun rebuilding breasts using only a
woman's own waistline fat without painfully cutting her abdominal
muscle the way most surgeons do. The sisters hope their extremely
unusual case brings attention to this little-known but gentler form
of breast reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a lot of doctors doing this. There's just not a
lot of awareness regarding this type of surgery,'' said Culbreath's
twin, Joan Liddell of Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women need to be aware this particular procedure is out there,
and much easier on the patient,'' added Culbreath of Dubach, La.
</P>
<P>
   Women in turmoil after a cancer diagnosis may not realize they
have a range of reconstruction options, but experts say it's vital
to investigate each thoroughly before deciding.
</P>
<P>
   A saline-filled breast implant is the most common choice.
They're fairly quick and inexpensive to perform, and many
recipients are very happy.
</P>
<P>
   But implants can cause certain side effects, and over time
require repeat surgeries to replace deflated implants or remove
painful scar tissue. In one government-mandated study unveiled last
week, a surprising 27 percent of implants required reoperations
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also can reconstruct a cancer patient's breast using her
own tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen S. Kroll of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center says
this produces a more natural-feeling breast, without the
reoperation problem. But it requires longer, more invasive surgery,
and some surgical methods cause their own complications.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Dr. Robert Allen, Louisiana State University's
plastic surgery chief and the twins' surgeon, is trying to
popularize the new, gentler method.
</P>
<P>
   The most common way surgeons rebuild breasts is called a ''TRAM
flap,'' in which they slice a section of abdominal fat and muscle,
keeping the flesh partially attached to the muscle because its
blood vessels nourish fat. They slide this tethered section under
the skin up to the chest, and sculpt a breast.
</P>
<P>
   In a variation called a ''free TRAM,'' doctors sever a smaller
piece of abdominal muscle, along with fat, from the body. Moving it
to the chest, they reattach the tiny blood vessels with meticulous
microsurgery. (Occasionally, buttocks or back muscle is used.)
</P>
<P>
   But cutting abdominal muscle can cause hernias and abdominal
weakness. Weakness is noticeable mostly to athletes, but after
large operations some women lack the muscle for a simple sit-up,
Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The less muscle cut the better, so ''free TRAMs'' cause far less
risk. Still, the risk isn't zero and cutting any muscle is painful.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's alternative: Transplant just skin and fat. He merely
dissects one artery and vein from the abdominal muscle, not the
muscle itself, to nourish the newly sculpted breast a few days
until new blood vessels begin growing.
</P>
<P>
   After studying this ''DIEP flap'' procedure, ''there's no
question in my mind that it reduces the amount of postoperative
pain. I believe it leaves patients with a stronger abdomen,'' said
Kroll at M.D. Anderson, who now uses the fat-only method on 70
percent of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   The twins hope their unusual experience alerts cancer patients
to the little-known option -- after all, most women have enough of
their own fat to use.
</P>
<P>
   Culbreath twice tried breast implants after her 1998 mastectomy,
but infection set in and her radiation-damaged skin couldn't fight
it.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said her 101-pound runner's body was too skinny for
tissue reconstruction, but Liddell half-jokingly offered a fat
transplant -- and doctors jumped. Since the 46-year-old twins are
identical except for the extra 20 pounds three pregnancies had left
Liddell, Culbreath could use her fat and skin without fear of
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Because Liddell's tummy tuck cut no muscle, she was walking
pain-free hours later. And Culbreath left the LSU hospital
thrilled: ''Implants are great, but I feel like this is better. ...
It's actual tissue, it feels just like the other breast.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters Throw Eggs at Albright  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright urged Eastern Europeans on Monday to play a bigger role in
bringing democracy to Serbia, after drawing applause and a barrage
of hurled eggs with her message to a university audience that
freedom requires financial sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, visiting the land of her birth, delivered a speech
Monday at Tomas Masaryk University in Brno in which she referred to
a pledge by Czech President Vaclav Havel on Sunday to cancel a $30
million sale of cooling duct parts by a Czech company to Iran's
Bushehr nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said halting the spread of nuclear weapons technology
''is not without cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To keep the best technology from falling into the wrong hands,
American firms are required to forgo many potentially profitable
contracts,'' Albright said, speaking in English. ''But a similar
responsibility rests upon the shoulders of all who pledged to
defend the best interests of the Euro-Atlantic community.''
</P>
<P>
   After her speech, which drew enthusiastic applause, Albright
left the auditorium for a nearby hall, where a crowd of
well-wishers had gathered to catch a glimpse of her. Suddenly, two
men shouted ''death to American imperialism'' and began hurling
eggs. Police Capt. Zdenek Lubas said two 22-year-old men described
as anarchists were detained for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was spattered with bits of egg, but most of them were
intercepted by her bodyguards, said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Albright was rushed away quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever is unable to think about the serious problems of
today's civilization, including globalization, has nothing better
to do than to take an egg and throw it at somebody,'' Havel said
later.
</P>
<P>
   Iran insists the Bushehr nuclear power plant is for peaceful
production of electricity, but the Clinton Administration fears the
Iranians are trying to develop a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider the campaign around Bushehr conducted by the Czech
government and the local media a gift to the American minister
Madeleine Albright linked to her visit,'' Sharif Khodai, the acting
Iranian ambassador to Prague, told the newspaper Pravo.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also met Monday afternoon in Prague, the Czech capital,
with private Czech and other Eastern European organizations to
discuss the challenges of bringing democracy to Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prevailing opinion was that Serbia's democratic opposition
within the country and the international community should focus on
elections in Serbia,'' said Tomas Pojar, head of the Prague-based
Man in Need foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving Sunday for a four-day visit, Albright has said
repeatedly that former communist countries such as the Czech
Republic can offer valuable lessons to Serbian opposition figures
in fighting for democracy against the authoritarian government of
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is visiting the Czech Republic on the 150th anniversary
of the birth of Czechoslovakia's first president, Tomas Masaryk, a
towering figure in the history of democracy in this part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering her speech at the university, Albright and
Havel visited Hodonin, where the former president was born March 7,
1850. Albright laid a wreath at the statue of Masaryk in the town
square.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has urged Czechs to follow the example of Masaryk in
promoting democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   Before her speech at the university, Albright met privately with
about a dozen students from the Gypsy minority to discuss
affirmative action and other ideas for improving their condition.
The European Union, to which the Czech Republic aspires for
membership, has criticized the government for not promoting equal
opportunity for the ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's father, Josef Korbel, was a Czech diplomat who fled
with his wife and children to London as Germany took control of
Czechoslovakia at the onset of World War II. When the communists
took over Czechoslovakia in 1948, the family then migrated to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of communism here, the Czech and Slovak republics
split into two countries in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Albright planned to meet with Foreign Minister Jan
Kavan and Prime Minister Milos Zeman. She is to leave Wednesday for
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> Many Elderly Don't Get Cancer Test  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few elderly Americans are getting screenings
for early detection of colon cancer, in spite of new Medicare
benefits that pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medicare beneficiaries' use of colorectal cancer services
falls far short of recommended levels,'' says new study by the
General Accounting Office, released at a hearing of the Senate
Aging Committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, just 14 percent of Americans over age 65 got one of
four types of colon cancer detection tests through Medicare, the
government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The new report said many people may not be getting the
screenings because they don't know Medicare covers them, they are
embarrassed to ask their doctor or they believe the tests would be
too uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you they are all much more appealing than dying of
this disease,'' said Katie Couric, host of NBC's Today show,
testifying before the Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday's Today show, Couric, whose husband died of colon
cancer at age 42, is scheduled to share film of her own recent
colonoscopy -- a procedure where a doctor uses a flexible tube to
look into the colon.
</P>
<P>
   Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths
in the United States, after lung cancer, with an estimated 129,400
cases and 56,600 deaths reported in 1999. However, it is a
slow-developing disease, and early detection and treatment can
significantly reduce fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   For people over aged 50, a simple test to detect blood in feces
-- one symptom of colon cancer -- is recommended yearly. Other, more
thorough tests, such as colonoscopy, are recommended every 5 to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare began covering the preventive screenings in 1998.
Beneficiaries can get the annual fecal test at no out-of-pocket
cost, even if they have not yet paid their Medicare deductible.

<HEADLINE> Hazy Conditions Reach Singapore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Smoky haze reached Singapore and was blowing
toward Malaysia on Monday, from growing brush fires on the
neighboring Indonesian island of Sumatra, the Singapore environment
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke pollution from illegal land-clearing fires in Indonesia
has become an annual problem during the region's dry season. The
situation was disastrous in 1997, when thick haze caused health
problems and hurt tourism in Singapore and parts of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over 400 hot spots were found in central Sumatra on March 5
and some were emitting smoke haze towards the Malacca Straits. This
has resulted in slightly hazy conditions over Singapore in the
afternoon,'' the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   But the ministry said it expects only a small portion of the
haze generated Monday to be carried over Singapore because of
changing winds.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Meteorological Service spokesman Wong Teo Suan said
slightly hazy conditions over Singapore and the central and
southern parts of the Malaysian peninsula were expected ''for a few
days.'' He said if the fires continue to spread, the haze could get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore monitors Indonesian forest fires by satellite as part
of a regional cooperation program.

<HEADLINE> Theaters Abroad Lift Film Industry  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio's latest movie, ''The
Beach,'' sank like the Titanic with U.S. moviegoers. Its
distributor, 20th Century Fox, isn't worried, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Beach'' is staying afloat in overseas markets, where it is
expected to gross at least twice its U.S. take, showing just how
big a force international theater circuits have become for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States saturated with new movie megaplexes,
cinema companies are turning more resources to construction of
movie screens overseas, theater owners said Monday at the opening
of ShoWest, the industry's annual trade show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't see a whole lot more growth in theaters in the United
States,'' said John Fithian, president of the National Association
of Theatre Owners. ''But the megaplexing of the world is just now
getting under way.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of theater screens overseas is about four times the
37,000 in the United States, but many foreign cinemas are outdated
and in need of the sort of makeover that has gone on among U.S.
theaters, with better sound, seating and other comforts, Fithian
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest of the world is actually untouched at this point,''
said Jerry Magner, chief financial officer for National Amusements
Inc. In the late 1980s, the Massachusetts-based theater chain had
no overseas cinemas, but nearly one-fourth of its 1,300 screens now
are in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign theaters accounted for less than a third of Hollywood's
movie revenue 20 years ago. Today, overseas cinemas make up about
55 percent of the industry's business, and that figure is expected
to rise as more modern theaters are built.
</P>
<P>
   Certain films that play better to foreign audiences, such as
''The Beach'' or MGM's James Bond adventures, can do an even higher
percentage of their business overseas.
</P>
<P>
   A dark, brooding tale of an American backpacker on a quest for
paradise in Thailand, ''The Beach'' failed to capture the
heartbreak crowd of young women who helped make DiCaprio's
''Titanic'' the highest-grossing movie of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Released last month, the movie has made an anemic $35 million
domestically but already has surpassed that in just a few European
countries, including Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's somber tone, foreign setting and international
popularity of director Danny Boyle, who made ''Trainspotting,''
probably gave it wider appeal among non-American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gianopulos, president of 20th Century Fox International,
said the studio expects ''The Beach'' to do at least twice as much
business overseas as in the United States. That should ensure the
studio will turn a profit on ''The Beach,'' which cost about $50
million to make.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of foreign movie markets is evident from Fox's ''Star
Wars'' movies. The first three films, from 1977, 1980 and 1983, did
far better domestically than overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The latest, last year's ''Phantom Menace,'' grossed $431 million
in the United States but $60 million more than that
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for ''Titanic,'' which took in $600 million
domestically and twice that outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you apply the sheer magnitude of the market place beyond
the U.S., you get this kind of result,'' Gianopulos said. ''There
are predictions out there over the next decade of the international
box office being two-thirds of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely growth markets for theater developers include Latin
America, Eastern Europe and Asia, notably China's untapped
audiences.

<HEADLINE> Last-minute voters sign up for Tuesday primary  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last-minute voters lined up in town halls around Connecticut
Monday to register to vote in Tuesday's presidential primary.
Ballots will be counted in other states as well from Maine to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Registrars reported that many of the people in line Monday
morning were new voters. Others were independents who decided to
register with a political party so they could vote in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The polls are open Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Windham Republican Registrar Maria Naumec said 17 unaffiliated
voters came in by the noon deadline to change their registrations
to the GOP. The town is politically a Democratic stronghold, where
Republicans are outnumbered more than 3-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all McCain voters,'' said Naumec. ''The interest in
McCain has just really blossomed here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stamford, which has more Republicans than any other
municipality in Connecticut, many residents just made the noon
deadline. Some voters who came in later had to be turned away to
vote on Tuesday, but they still could register for the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute registrants came from both parties, although more of
them were Republican, registrars for both parties reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election certainly has held a lot of interest, and that's
a good sign. It's healthy for America,'' said Barbara McInerney,
Stamford's Republican registrar.
</P>
<P>
   This last-minute frenzy will help decide the candidate who
claims Connecticut's delegates -- 67 to the Democratic National
Convention and 25 to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a winner-take-all system, while Democratic
delegates are allotted proportionally.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's share of the delegate pie and its overall
influence in national presidential politics is much smaller than
most other states also holding primaries on Super Tuesday, such as
California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the 13 states voting in Republican primaries Tuesday
carry 613 delegates. Democrats in 15 states will allot 1,315
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has had a losing track record when it comes to
picking the party nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The state started holding presidential primaries in 1980, when
the winners in Connecticut were Democratic Massachusetts Sen.
Edward Kennedy and Republican George Bush, son of former U.S. Sen.
Prescott Bush. The nominees were Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Connecticut Democrats chose former Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart as their nominee -- but Walter Mondale ended up being the
party's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was on the money for 1988's nominees: George Bush
and former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, however, state Democrats chose former California Gov.
Jerry Brown over President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Renault, Samsung Mull Alliance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French automaker Renault said Monday it offered to
create a joint venture with Samsung Motors in hopes of allowing the
troubled South Korean car maker to produce 200,00 vehicles annually
within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Renault said in a statement it offered Samsung Group and
creditors of Samsung Motors an initial investment $335 million to
acquire the operating assets of the automaker. Renault's plan would
create a venture that would be 70 percent owned by Renault and 30
percent by Samsung Motors; the venture would acquire Samsung
Motors' assets including the Samsung brand, its plant in Pusan,
South Korea, a research and development center and the company's
dealership network.
</P>
<P>
   Renault has been in takeover talks with Samsung since December.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Motors, a subsidiary of the Samsung Group conglomerate,
entered the nation's already saturated auto market in early 1998
with an annual capacity of 240,000 cars. It produced only 50,000
cars in 1998 and 2,000 in 1999, when operations were halted during
most of the year amid severe financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   With $4 billion in debt and $3 billion in assets, Samsung was
put in receivership in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Renault said that under a business plan it prepared, the Pusan
plant would be able to produce 200,000 cars in a few years. Renault
expected that Samsung brand would win between 10 percent and 15
percent of the South Korean car market.
</P>
<P>
   The French carmaker hopes through a deal with Samsung to gain
greater access to the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Motors has been cited as a typical case of
overinvestment by South Korean conglomerates which relied heavily
on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Another South Korean carmaker, Daewoo Motors Co., is also on the
market. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. of the United
States have expressed interest in taking over that company.

<HEADLINE> Christian Democrats Fight Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Christian Democrats filed court papers
Monday asking a judge to overturn a $20.6 million fine imposed on
the party by parliament for a falsified 1998 financial report.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse had fined the party for
failing to declare the equivalent of $9 million held in secret
accounts abroad by the Christian Democrats branch in Hesse state.
</P>
<P>
   The party filed a 75-page complaint in a Berlin court Monday
against the fine. In the complaint, the party said it had corrected
the financial report and should not face any fines, and also that
it could not have known the Hesse state party had secret accounts
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, the largest ever in Germany, was the first financial
consequence of the scandal over secret accounts and off-the-books
donations during former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 25 years heading
the party.
</P>
<P>
   The party's financial reports are used to calculate matching
federal campaign funds. The party also could face additional fines
for other years of reports, as well as a penalty of up to three
times the illegal donations it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has said he will soon be finished collecting from donors
the equivalent of $3 million, an amount that would cover the fines
the party could face for the up to $1 million in donations Kohl
accepted from sources he refuses to identify.

<HEADLINE> New Gov't Sworn in on Anguilla  </HEADLINE>
By WYCLIFFE RICHARDSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Anguilla's new chief minister took
the oath of office Monday and promised ''a new course'' for the
British Caribbean territory dogged for the last year by political
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are changing the scene in Anguilla,'' said Chief Minister
Osbourne Fleming. ''Anguilla is on a new course, and we ask you all
to stay on board the train with us for this train is bound for
prosperity, love and unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters cheered as Attorney General Ronald Scipio
administered the oaths before British Gov. Peter Johnstone in the
House of Assembly chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Anguilla, whose 10,000 inhabitants depend heavily on upscale
tourism for income, had been caught in a political deadlock after a
previous coalition government collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock had exasperated officials in Britain, while local
residents complained officials did little to create jobs or respond
to a London proposal that would change the relationship between
Britain and its territories.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's Anguilla National Alliance joined with the Anguilla
Democratic Party in Friday's election to wrest control of the House
of Assembly from former Chief Minister Hubert Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' Anguilla United Movement lost its majority in the
assembly when finance minister Victor Banks defected in May, and
the ensuing political standoff paralyzed the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Banks -- who was sworn in Monday as finance minister
in Fleming's new government -- said he was pleased his decision had
led to an alliance between the two former opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought we would come this course in such a short time
and bring people together in the way that we have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks promised ''a government of interaction with the people''
and pledged it would last past the next elections, due in 2005. The
fragile former government collapsed amid lawsuits in less than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Eric Reid -- elected to the territory's seven-member
local assembly -- was sworn in as social services minister and
Kenneth Harrigan became infrastructure and communications minister.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Mexico Sign Free Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and Mexico signed a free trade agreement
Monday that will abolish protective tariffs between the two
countries by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, similar to Mexico's free trade agreement with the
United States, was signed in the presence of Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and his Mexican counterpart, Ernesto Zedillo, who is on a
three-day visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Trade and Industry Minister Ran Cohen said the pact
would ''increase bilateral trade by tens of millions of dollars,''
would enable Israeli exporters to compete with U.S. products in
Mexico, and would advance joint projects in communications,
agriculture, infrastructure and other fields, according to a
statement from his office. Cohen is currently visiting China.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is to begin to take effect in July, and by 2005
should all but abolish tariffs on goods traded between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said it would open opportunities and strengthen
understanding between Israel and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's exports to Mexico in 1999 totaled $130 million, while
Mexico exported only $38 million to Israel last year.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's exports are mostly high-tech and include medical
equipment, pharmaceuticals and agricultural supplies. The main
Mexican export to Israel is oil.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was signed by Mexican Commerce and Industrial
Development Minister Blanco Mendoza and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who arrived late Saturday, met with Levy and Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Monday after touring religious and historic
sites on Sunday, including Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   He was to fly home Tuesday after laying a wreath in the Tel Aviv
square where Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Courting a tough crowd on Super Tuesday eve  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wearing a blue windbreaker to cut the early
morning chill, Bill Bradley stuck out a gloved hand to greet
commuters streaming off the Staten Island Ferry in Manhattan.
''Trying to get to work, get out of the way!'' one young man said,
brushing by.
</P>
<P>
   It can be tough on the presidential campaign trail on Super
Tuesday eve.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley shook dozens of hands as commuters rushed off the ferry
at 7:45 a.m. Not wanting to make enemies in a state key to his
campaign's survival, the Democrat made sure his aides and the press
corps stood aside to let people by, but still drew some grumbling
from New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Others were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beat Al Gore, buddy,'' one man said as he shook Bradley's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep hitting jumpers from the corner,'' said Nathaniel White,
30, who remembered Bradley's days with the New York Knicks.
''You've got our support in the hip-hop community.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, squeezing in a radio station interview by telephone en
route to the Bronx, Bradley was asked about his early mornings and
late nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rest is for another day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The vice president sounded tired as he moved through the day,
speaking soberly to Jewish leaders about foreign policy, then
visiting a physical therapy gym at the Lutheran Medical Center in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Circulating bed by bed, Gore knelt to shake hands of subdued
patients, some of them severely bruised and broken.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Lubrano, who had shattered both legs and her left arm in a
Jan. 14 car accident, was lifting a small weight with her right arm
when Gore reached tentatively for a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you do? I don't want to interrupt your weight lifting
there,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Republican front-runner George W. Bush, still battling a nasty
cold that has grounded several members of his traveling press corps
with bronchitis, got a few moments to rest his voice when his wife
took questions from the audience at an event in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband looking admiringly over her shoulder, Laura
Bush said that education ''is the single-most important issue
facing this country'' and she would work as first lady ''to make
sure every child was able to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at a news conference, Laura Bush said she joined her
husband because ''I just thought it would be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that she often travels separately from her husband, she
added: ''I wanted to be a part of it if there were any questions
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Although he wasn't his normally energetic self, Bush retained
his sense of humor. When he saw a reporter struggling to get around
a table to put his tape recorder near the podium, the governor
walked over and grabbed the tape recorder, as well as several more
that were then thrust in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's the 'Off' button?'' he asked playfully.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who received bad reviews last week for his appearance on
CBS's ''The Late Show with David Letterman,'' appeared eager to do
better when he made a guest appearance Monday on NBC's ''The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   His staff was bouncing around material, and the Texas governor
repeatedly asked reporters traveling with him for joke suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   None was offered.

<HEADLINE> Washington Pleased by Putin Remarks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Positive comments by acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin about the possibility of Russia joining NATO
indicate a renewed willingness in Moscow to improve relations with
the western alliance, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is certainly prepared to work with Russia
and our allies in pursuing closer cooperation,'' spokesman James
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Russia could join NATO, Putin told British
Broadcasting Corp. interviewer Sir David Frost: ''I don't see why
not. I wouldn't rule out such a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He conditioned such a step on Russian views being taken into
account as an equal partner. The interview was broadcast Sunday and
picked up by Russia's main networks.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said NATO could expand
to include Russia, but other U.S. politicians strongly resist the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said Putin's answer showed a renewed willingness to work
again with the alliance in the spirit of agreements reached between
NATO and Russia in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we welcome acting President Putin's determination to
establish good relations with the West. And we see his statement in
that light,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Putin made clear that the question of
membership in NATO is not currently on Russia's agenda.

<HEADLINE> Signs for Bush in Ohio, N.England  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's fortunes in New England and
Ohio could be early signs to foretell whether Super Tuesday voting
from Maine to California will deliver him the Republican
presidential nomination or force him into another round against the
challenge of John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, there is less suspense. Only a miracle of upsets,
beginning from the first votes counted, can keep Al Gore from
effectively sealing that nomination. And Bill Bradley doesn't
really expect that, for all his talk of a Harry Truman-style
reversal for his waning campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 presidential primaries, caucuses elsewhere,
decisions in 16 states across the time zones, Northeast to Midwest
to the West Coast. California is crucial on March 7, as it may be
again on Nov. 7, when the next president is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The 162 Republican delegates that will be committed to the GOP
winner there represent 16 percent of the votes needed to win the
nomination. Polls rate Gov. Bush well ahead of Sen. McCain among
the Republican voters who will award those delegates.
</P>
<P>
   There is a separate, all-candidates preference vote, and that is
closer. Winning it will be a talking point, and an argument for
electability there in the fall, but with no reward in nominating
delegates, the contest that counts now. The positioning primaries
are over; Super Tuesday is about hard numbers, not momentum or
doing well or any of the other catchwords of the earlier campaign
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much of this is an expectations game,'' McCain said. But
that game is over. Bush said the attention on Wednesday morning
will focus on the number of nominating votes each candidate won.
Gore had 482 Democratic delegates in his column going in, Bradley
57. It will take 2,170 to win that nomination. Bush has 170 GOP
delegates, McCain 105, with 1,034 needed to nominate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither leader can mathematically clinch the nomination on Super
Tuesday. There aren't enough delegates. But either or both could
settle the contest by winning enough states and delegates to force
his rival to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assign their delegates in proportion to popular votes,
by state or district, so Bradley will claim a share even in a Gore
sweep of the 15 Democratic contests on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think we have to win a couple of states,'' Bradley said,
a forlorn assessment of the outlook for a challenger who once
loomed as a real threat to Gore. Unless the couple of states were
to be upsets in California and New York, Bradley's next step is
probably out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Tuesday delegates represent about 60 percent of a
nominating majority in each party.
</P>
<P>
   While that is the number to watch, counting it up will go far
into election night and the early morning hours on Wednesday. The
California polls are open until 11 p.m. Eastern time, and three
Western caucus states begin reporting at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   New York offers the second richest lode of delegate votes, 243
to be apportioned between Gore and Bradley based on their popular
vote; 101 in a more complex Republican primary that will take
longer to count after the polls close at 9 p.m. The Republican
primary is really 31 separate contests, in each congressional
district, without a statewide contest. Delegates are the big names
on the ballot, with their candidate commitments are in the fine
print.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be earlier clues to the Super Tuesday verdict
before all that is counted.
</P>
<P>
   The first will come when the polls close in Georgia and Vermont
at 7 p.m. EST, and the question there is whether they run to form.
Bush should win in Georgia, for 54 delegates, McCain in Vermont,
for 12. An upset in either could be a sign that the unpredictable
primary season is going to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has not been a primary yet that's met expectations,''
McCain said. ''It's just too volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes so. The first of the big three Super Tuesday states to
return its verdict is Ohio, where the polls close at 7:30 p.m. EST.
Bush is favored; McCain's survival prospects would sink with a
defeat there. The Arizona senator is almost certain to remain one
unless he can win two of the three biggest prizes on Tuesday, and
that makes Ohio essential.
</P>
<P>
   Then the returns from four more New England states, McCain's
most promising territory. But Bush has gained the edge in polling
in Connecticut, once the family political base, where his
grandfather was a senator.
</P>
<P>
   He's also set sights on Maine -- the Kennebunkport White House
and all. McCain is the runaway leader in polls in Massachusetts,
where his landslide sendoff in the New Hampshire primary still
echoes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the bottom line: California. McCain's strategists
haven't gone to the point of conceding that without a victory
there, they'll have to concede the nomination. But close. Political
director John Weaver said it is hard to see how to capture the
nomination without winning that primary. And that would take a
major upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt of the absolute importance of California,''
McCain said earlier. ''To understate it is just not a recognition
of reality.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Donors Subpoenaed in Probe  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Some of New Jersey's top Democratic
fund-raisers and donors have been subpoenaed by a Justice
Department task force investigating fund-raising abuses in Sen.
Robert Torricelli's 1996 campaign, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both a Justice Department official and Torricelli attorney Abbe
Lowell said the senator is not a focus of the investigation, which
has led to convictions of three of his contributors and the
indictment of another contributor and his aide over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Torricelli is chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee -- a position he won partly because of
the $9.2 million he raised in 1996 for his victory over Rep.
Richard A. Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve to 15 prominent New Jersey donors who were ''somehow
connected to the Torricelli campaign'' received subpoenas Thursday,
said a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The official didn't know if all those subpoenaed had
made contributions to Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas ask donors for all correspondence with Torricelli
and his campaign, records of contributions, and records showing
whether any contributions were rejected because they failed to
comply with federal limits, The New York Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said the documents include records of contributions to
the Clinton-Gore Coordinated Campaign Fund of 1996, which raised
money for the Democratic presidential campaign and several New
Jersey congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to learn whether fund-raisers and
Torricelli campaign staffers encouraged a practice known as conduit
financing, in which a donor evades the $1,000 federal limit on
campaign donations by funneling money through others, The
Star-Ledger of Newark reported on Monday, citing an unidentified
source.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said he conducted his own inquiry of Torricelli's
campaign staff to see if that occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only did that not happen, but the opposite happened,'' he
said. ''People went out of their way to make sure that the campaign
rules were followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Three donors have admitted in federal court over the past year
that they made conduit contributions.

Monday, as she urged both the Tutsi-led government and Hutu rebels
to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides should not expect quick results in the
negotiations to end the country's seven-year civil war, Nkosazana
Zuma told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
   The former South African president reportedly said Saturday that
he might withdraw from public life, which caused unease in Burundi,
where his appointment as mediator last year gave hope for an end to
the ethnic violence that has claimed more than 200,000 Tutsi and
Hutu lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''At present, Mandela has not resigned,'' Zuma said. ''We should
not expect miracles. We should give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Burundi government spokesman Luc Rukingama said negotiations
were proceeding as usual, as Burundi had not received notification
that Mandela was considering quitting the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In Cape Town on Monday, Mandela's spokeswoman Zelda la Grange
said he had been misquoted on Saturday, and that Mandela was in
good health and had no plans to give up his role as mediator.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, negotiating teams from 18 political parties, interest
groups and government and army representatives returned from
Arusha, in neighboring Tanzania, where they had been drafting
several proposals: for a period of transition, for the integration
of Hutu rebels into the Tutsi-dominated army, and for an elections
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process is not about sudden breakthroughs. It's a
process,'' Zuma said, adding that restoring dignity to Burundi was
crucial for the stability of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   However, two main rebels groups fighting to overthrow President
Pierre Buyoya have neither attended the talks nor agreed to a
cease-fire, which is considered the first crucial step in ending
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The killing began in 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated
the country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hutu groups have taken up arms, accusing the Tutsi
minority of usurping power. The predominantly Tutsi political
parties accuse the rebels of conducting a campaign of terror in the
countryside, where an estimated 1.2 million have been displaced to
government-run camps or refugee centers in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Zuma said she was saddened by the conditions in some of the 60
squalid camps, where the army had herded about 350,000 mostly Hutu
peasants in a bid to cut them off from the rebels who rely on them
for food, shelter and money.
</P>
<P>
   The government has closed six camps and promised to dismantle
the rest.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Given Medal Proclamation  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ailing Cardinal John O'Connor smiled and joked
Monday as he was presented with a proclamation awarding him the
Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just nice. It was just one of those nice, almost
magical moments that we are lucky enough to take part in ... it was
so good to see him vigorous,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., presented the framed
proclamation to O'Connor at his Archdiocese residence. The medal
will be presented to the cardinal in a few months once it has been
minted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It meant a great deal to him. He was very, very happy, very
pleased about the whole thing,'' the cardinal's spokesman, Joe
Zwilling, said after Monday's presentation of the document.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed the proclamation on Sunday and in a
statement said, ''For more than 50 years, Cardinal O'Connor has
served the Catholic Church and our nation with constancy and
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled O'Connor's early days performing parish work in
his native Philadelphia, his service as a military chaplain in
Korea and Vietnam and his 16 years leading the New York
Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, and
both houses rushed to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of his
precarious health.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is recuperating from brain tumor surgery last year.
Zwilling said the 80-year-old cardinal was ''feeling better the
last few days but still weak and not able to resume a regular
schedule.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Budget Work Is Plodding  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the promises of Republican leaders
that Congress will attack its fiscal work quickly this election
year, divisions in the GOP ranks have so far prevented lawmakers
from producing even initial versions of any budget measures.
</P>
<P>
   A month after President Clinton sent Congress his $1.84 trillion
budget for next year, neither the House nor Senate budget
committees have countered with their own proposals. Both panels
hope to complete initial spending plans this week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Budget writers have been stymied to date by disputes between
conservatives, who want to hold overall spending for many programs
to this year's level, and other Republicans who say more is needed
to bolster defense, education and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders say they still hope Congress will complete its budget by
April 15, the legally required deadline that lawmakers usually
miss. The budget is a tax and spending blueprint for future,
binding bills and does not require Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the standoff is increasing the prospects for the
scenario that GOP leaders most want to avoid: an October battle
with Clinton, just weeks before Election Day, in which the White
House uses the leverage of must-pass bills to win additional
billions for schools, the environment, and other popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''At some point you quit doodling around and you have a meeting
and you vote,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said
Monday regarding the Republican combatants.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace on the budget tracks Congress' leisurely start
this year, in which recesses have been frequent and lawmakers have
seemed distracted by the two parties' presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over spending has symbolic importance for
conservatives eager to signal that the GOP remains fiscally austere
in this era of budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   But it has other implications as well. The more money Congress
spends now the smaller projected federal surpluses will be, and
smaller surpluses would leave less room for the tax cuts many
Republicans want -- including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a leading
GOP presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   When it is finally written, the House's budget is likely to
propose a five-year tax cut of about $200 billion, about double
Clinton's proposal and half what Bush wants. It also will seek
about what the president proposed for education, defense and
biomedical research, say Republican aides speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's budget will be similar but is likely to offer a
slightly smaller tax cut than the House's.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the internal GOP fight is discretionary spending,
the one-third of the budget that Congress and the president
apportion every year. It covers all federal spending, from troops'
uniforms to cancer research, with the exception of Social Security,
interest on the national debt and other payments the government
makes automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives would like to hold discretionary spending to about
$586 billion, roughly what is being spent in fiscal 2000, which
runs through Sept. 30. That is about $35 billion less than Clinton
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   If spending is allowed to keep growing, said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, people in the future will look back and ask, ''Where are
the skid marks? Where did somebody try to put on the brakes?''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., argue that with a rough consensus for higher
spending for the Pentagon, education, biomedical research,
prescription drugs and other programs, neither Congress nor Clinton
would ever agree to limit next year's spending to this year's
total.
</P>
<P>
   They say the only realistic way for lawmakers to quickly
complete their budget work so they can go home for their
re-election campaigns is to push next year's discretionary spending
closer to $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some Republicans that I work with don't seem to know that
yet,'' Domenici said recently of the need to compromise on
spending. ''They think we ought to get our way.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is among those trying to
hold spending down. He has even urged Lott to do so in the Senate
so that the eventual House-Senate compromise is not too high, Lott
said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Seeks Better Iran Ties  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- In a visit aimed at strengthening ties,
Germany's foreign minister said Monday that Iran and Germany
''should look forward and not to the past'' in their relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had very difficult times in the past years,'' Minister
Joschka Fischer told reporters on his arrival to Tehran. ''We hope
to improve relations and especially have President Mohammad Khatami
visit Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-German relations were strained during the two-year
ordeal involving German businessman Helmut Hofer. The 56-year-old
man was twice sentenced to death in Iran for an illicit
relationship with a 26-year-old Iranian medical student, but was
finally acquitted and released from prison in January.
</P>
<P>
   His release was widely seen as a prelude to a visit by Khatami
to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer is expected to hold talks with his Iranian counterpart,
Kamal Kharrazi, later Monday, and is to meet Khatami on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The visit comes as Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
prepared to conclude his three-day trip to Iran later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has welcomed closer cooperation with Iran
after Khatami's supporters ousted hard-liners from control of the
parliament for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the German Foreign Ministry said Fischer would raise
the issues of human rights and Iran's arms policies during his
two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> 60 Hurt in Honduras Bridge Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By FREDDY CUEVAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- A temporary bridge built by the
U.S. Army in the wake of Hurricane Mitch split in two and collapsed
into a shallow river, slightly injuring 60 people. It was the
second such temporary span, known as a Bailey bridge, to collapse
in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, a vintage World War II, iron-and-plank structure
visited by President Clinton in 1999, fell about 100 feet Sunday
after splitting in the middle, leaving two sections tilting
downward into the bed of the Choluteca River.
</P>
<P>
   ''It probably fell because of the excess weight'' of heavy
vehicle traffic, rather than any structural defect, Transport
Minister Tomas Lozano said. The span had been inspected in December
by Honduran authorities and was found to be in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two buses, three cars and a truck loaded with sand were on the
bridge at the time of the collapse. All six vehicles remained on
the span, and 60 of their 80 passengers received minor injuries,
Lozano said. Red Cross workers rescued the people from their cars.
Only one, a 12-year-old boy with a fractured leg, remained in the
hospital on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They received some bumps and bruises, but they're all okay ...
just scared,'' Lozano said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were to remove the cars with cranes on Monday, and
pledged to fix the bridge at a cost of about $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would immediately ban heavy truck traffic on 23
similar temporary bridges, erected to replace spans washed away by
floods during Hurricane Mitch, which hit the country in November
1998 and killed more than 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Choluteca River, which separates the capital of Tegucigalpa
from its sister city Comayaguela, was transformed into raging
floodwaters during Mitch, but is now little more than a slow
trickle in a drying riverbed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. soldiers constructed the bridge in just 15 days in January
1999. It is one of six built by the U.S. Army; the rest were built
by Hondurans under American supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, President Clinton and Honduran President Carlos
Flores Facusse stood on the bridge for a half-hour while Clinton
announced a $900 million aid package to help Honduras and other
Central American countries affected by Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second collapse of a temporary bridge in the past
four months. In November, a Bailey bridge in Ilama, 80 miles west
of Tegucigalpa, fell.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials had planned to replace the temporary
structures with permanent bridges within a five-year period, but
funding for the replacements is still uncertain.

<HEADLINE> Accused INS Cuba Spy Pleas Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official accused of spying for
the Cuban government pleaded innocent Monday to federal charges of
communicating national defense secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, stood silently
during the brief arraignment hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is adamant that he is not guilty of these charges,'' said
lawyer Diane Ward, standing in for Faget's lawyer. ''He is adamant
that he did not do anything to betray his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Faget was indicted Friday on charges he relayed U.S. secrets to
a Cuban citizen and lied about contacts with Cuban government
officials over a 14-month period.
</P>
<P>
   He has been jailed without bond since his high-profile arrest
Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie notified the court that
the case will involve classified information that will require
Faget's attorney, Ed O'Donnell, to be cleared to handle government
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the Classified Information Protection Act also means
government documents will be filed under seal and the public will
be barred from hearings or parts of them.

<HEADLINE> Campaign 2000 Notes and Quotes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mysteriously, they pop up at his campaign rallies:
Posterboards scrawled in marker or paint, ''Gore is a babe!''
</P>
<P>
   The first was spotted in Pueblo, Colo., held aloft at the rear
of the crowd by a white-haired woman. Now, here, on stage at Vice
President Al Gore's weekend rally outside Faneuil Hall, where he
braced the winter cold in a knit pullover that showed off the
fruits of his sit-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Margolius, who later posed for a photograph with Gore, said
she plucked the neon-pink poster from a pile that she and fellow
campaign volunteers had hand-lettered in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''My roommate and I say it all the time,'' said Margolius, a
Boston University freshman. ''He IS a babe. He's a smart man and a
handsome man. He's basically everything you want a man to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She had to shout over the strain of what has become an anthem of
sorts for Gore -- a catchy beat by Fat Boy Slim, whose lyrics
insist: ''I have to celebrate you, baby. I have to praise you like
I should.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that her poster wasn't exactly unprecedented, could it be
that Gore's campaign was masterminding a proliferation of his
''babe'' image?
</P>
<P>
   ''Nah. Lots of people just have the same idea,'' said Margolius.

</P>
<P>
   But Pat Buchanan said he was in the race to stay, even if Dole's

must ''win a couple of states'' in order to salvage his campaign
against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and McCain campaigned in California, Bradley and Gore
were a continent away in New York. Bush said he wasn't worried that
the primary battle would leave the GOP fractured, and even gave
McCain ''a lot of credit for bringing people to the party.''

   Gore courted the state's Jewish activists, saying that in a Gore

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children as young as 2 can try a once-a-day
cherry-flavored pill to help prevent asthma attacks, the Food and
Drug Administration decided Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The drug Singulair, manufactured by Merck &AMP; Co., already is used
by adults and older children.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA approved a slightly lower-dose pill Monday intended
for children ages 2 to 5, making Singulair the first asthma
prevention therapy for children so young.
</P>
<P>
   Singulair does not treat asthma attacks -- patients still must
carry their quick-relief medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Singulair is a non-steroid drug that blocks leukotrines,
substances associated with asthma's inflammatory problems. Blocking
leukotrines can decrease the number of asthma attacks patients
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-milligram tablets will available by prescription by
mid-March, with an estimated retail cost of $77 to $80 for a

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Prosecutor: Trial Is On  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scotland's top prosecutor met Monday with some
families of victims of the Pan Am 103 jetliner bombing and assured
them the case against two men accused of the crime will go to trial
without delay despite his predecessor's sudden resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Boyd, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, also held a brief,
private meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and visited the
cairn that memorializes the Pan Am 103 victims at Arlington
National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   After a closed meeting with about 20 family members, Boyd said
trial preparation will not be affected by the resignation. Boyd
took over as lead prosecutor after Lord Hardie resigned last month
to accept a judgeship.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in Peabody, Mass., he had delivered the same message
to an annual meeting of Northeast-based families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is set to begin May 3 in the Netherlands under
Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al-Magrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhiman
pleaded innocent in February to charges including murder and
conspiracy to murder in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The plane
exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 259
people on the plane and 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that the two men were responsible for
placing a suitcase bomb on a flight originating in Malta and having
it transferred onto the Pan Am airliner in London. The men,
employed by the Libyan national airline in Malta, were allegedly
undercover intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's meeting, Boyd said he would not object to release
of a letter from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, although he pointed out he lacks the authority to
release the document now in the hands of the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some families of the victims believe the letter indicates that
Gadhafi turned over the two suspects in exchange for protection
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Boyd said the letter ''does not affect me in any way in the
prosecution of the case.''

<HEADLINE> OTC Allergy Remedy Effects Studied  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Over-the-counter medicines used by millions
of hay fever sufferers may affect their driving more than alcohol,
a study indicates.
</P>
<P>
   University of Iowa researchers who tested 40 allergy sufferers
in a driving simulator found that the standard dose of
antihistamine contained in Benadryl and many similar medicines had
a greater effect than alcohol on driving ''coherence,'' or the
ability to match the speed of the vehicle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The antihistamine, diphenhydramine, also had an effect similar
to alcohol on steering stability and the likelihood of crossing
into the oncoming lane, according to the study in Tuesday's issue
of Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were quite surprised to find that diphenhydramine may have
an even greater impact on the complex task of operating an
automobile than does alcohol,'' said Dr. John M. Weiler, a
University of Iowa medical professor. ''That sends a chilling
message. You would not want to be on the road when someone is
driving at you who is taking these.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also looked at a newer antihistamine, fexofenadine,
used in the prescription drug Allegra. The researchers said that
when it came to driving ability, fexofenadine was indistinguishable
from a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said more than 39 million Americans suffer from
hay fever and allergies and 4.8 million take prescription drugs.
Most go without treatment or take over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   These medicines often come with warnings that they can cause
drowsiness and should not be used while operating heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration researcher
Richard Compton said that there had been too little research on the
effects of allergy medications on driving safety and that people
often ignore warnings about mixing them with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   However, Compton said a study of blood tests on victims of fatal
crashes in the early 1990s suggested that antihistamine impairment
was far less prevalent than alcohol impairment.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Benadryl, Warner-Lambert Co., attacked the new
study as ''seriously flawed'' because it was partially funded by
Aventis, the maker of Allegra. Weiler strongly defended his work,
saying, ''I am not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers had 40 allergy sufferers ages 25 to 45 report
once a week over a four-week period to the driving simulator in a
huge hangar-like building in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   Each was tested once after being given the usual dose of
diphenhydramine; once with the usual dose of fexofenadine; once
with enough alcohol to produce a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1
percent, the legal limit in some states; and once with a placebo
containing no medication or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Over a simulated 45-mile course on a two-lane rural road, the
machine measured participants' ability to match speeds as a lead
vehicle speeded and slowed, their ability to stay in their lane,
and their ability to avoid a crash when a vehicle pulled out from a
driveway in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Test drivers' following ability was significantly better after
they took alcohol or fexofenadine than after diphenhydramine.
Steering instability was greater with diphenhydramine or alcohol
than fexofenadine or placebo. The number of times they crossed into
the oncoming lane was twice as great after taking diphenhydramine
as after fexofenadine or placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler also pointed out that the participants' assessments of
how drowsy they were did not correlate with their performance,
suggesting that people who take antihistamines may not be able to
judge when they are impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The results did not surprise people who have taken over-the
counter allergy medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just zonk me out,'' Debbie Newton, a Mercerville, N.J.,
educational testing company employee. ''For each pill you have a
cup of coffee or a cup of cappuccino.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Greyhound bus crash killed seven people and injured 18
on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1998, the National Transportation
Safety Board blamed the sleepy driver's irregular work hours and
also said he was impaired by antihistamine.

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Union, Justice Meet  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Representatives of four white New York City
policemen acquitted in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man
asked a top Justice Department official Monday to decide quickly
whether federal civil rights charges will be brought, expressing
fears the case would be further politicized if it dragged out.
</P>
<P>
   The police union officials noted that President Clinton spoke
about the case for the first time last weekend, saying he believes
race may have been a factor in the shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is involved in politics and he's concerned about
the Senate race that his wife is running in New York City,''
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said
after a half-hour meeting with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder,
the department's No. 2 official.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for the Senate in New York and
has criticized New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's oversight of
the police department. Giuliani is her likely Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Worth, the lawyer for one of the four officers, Edward
McMellon, said that in the meeting, Holder promised to decide in a
''matter of weeks'' whether to seek charges.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said he pushed for a quick answer because the officers
''want to know what their futures are, if they're going to have to
fight this battle again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department declined to comment on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Diallo's parents, Al Sharpton and other black
activists met for nearly two hours with Holder and asked him to
pursue federal charges against the four officers. Afterward, some
2,000 people protested outside the department.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers fired 41 shots at Diallo as he stood in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building Feb. 4, 1999. He was
struck 19 times. The officers testified they feared for their lives
when Diallo, 22, reached in his pocket for a black object they
thought was a gun. It was a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
acquitted Feb. 25 of charges ranging from second-degree murder to
reckless endangerment. The racially mixed jury heard the case in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said there is no legal basis for a federal trial and gave
Holder a thick brief laying out the arguments against pursuing
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that didn't come up (at the trial) in Albany
was racial profiling and we stressed that this was not a racial
profiling case,'' Worth said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the officers' lawyers initially were to attend the
meeting. But Worth said Justice officials balked because of ethical
concerns over meeting with defense attorneys while a review was
pending. Worth attended as PBA's general counsel. Tom Scotto,
president of the National Association of Police Organizations, also
attended.

<HEADLINE> Breast Built From Sister's Fat  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer stole Jane Culbreath's breast. Two
tries at breast implants failed.
</P>
<P>
   And when doctors considered rebuilding her breast using her own
tissue, it turned out that at 101 pounds, Culbreath didn't have
enough fat to spare.
</P>
<P>
   But her otherwise identical twin sister did. So in a medical
first, a tummy tuck for one sister provided enough fat and skin to
build the other a new breast.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect fat donations to become common.
</P>
<P>
   But a few doctors have begun rebuilding breasts using only a
woman's own waistline fat without painfully cutting her abdominal
muscle the way most surgeons do. The sisters hope their extremely
unusual case brings attention to this little-known but gentler form
of breast reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a lot of doctors doing this. There's just not a
lot of awareness regarding this type of surgery,'' said Culbreath's
twin, Joan Liddell of Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women need to be aware this particular procedure is out there,
and much easier on the patient,'' added Culbreath of Dubach, La.
</P>
<P>
   Women in turmoil after a cancer diagnosis may not realize they
have a range of reconstruction options, but experts say it's vital
to investigate each thoroughly before deciding.
</P>
<P>
   A saline-filled breast implant is the most common choice.
They're fairly quick and inexpensive to perform, and many
recipients are very happy.
</P>
<P>
   But implants can cause certain side effects, and over time
require repeat surgeries to replace deflated implants or remove
painful scar tissue. In one government-mandated study unveiled last
week, a surprising 27 percent of implants required reoperations
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also can reconstruct a cancer patient's breast using her
own tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen S. Kroll of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston says this produces a more natural-feeling breast, without
the reoperation problem. But it requires longer, more invasive
surgery, and some surgical methods cause their own complications.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Dr. Robert Allen, plastic surgery chief at Louisiana
State University's Health Sciences Center in New Orleans and the
twins' surgeon, is trying to popularize the new, gentler method.
</P>
<P>
   The most common way surgeons rebuild breasts is called a ''TRAM
flap,'' in which they slice a section of abdominal fat and muscle,
keeping the flesh partially attached to the muscle because its
blood vessels nourish fat. They slide this tethered section under
the skin up to the chest, and sculpt a breast.
</P>
<P>
   In a variation called a ''free TRAM,'' doctors sever a smaller
piece of abdominal muscle, along with fat, from the body. Moving it
to the chest, they reattach the tiny blood vessels with meticulous
microsurgery. (Occasionally, buttocks or back muscle is used.)
</P>
<P>
   But cutting abdominal muscle can cause hernias and abdominal
weakness. Weakness is noticeable mostly to athletes, but after
large operations some women lack the muscle for a simple sit-up,
Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The less muscle cut the better, so ''free TRAMs'' cause far less
risk. Still, the risk isn't zero and cutting any muscle is painful.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's alternative: Transplant just skin and fat. He merely
dissects one artery and vein from the abdominal muscle, not the
muscle itself, to nourish the newly sculpted breast a few days
until new blood vessels begin growing.
</P>
<P>
   After studying this ''DIEP flap'' procedure, ''there's no
question in my mind that it reduces the amount of postoperative
pain. I believe it leaves patients with a stronger abdomen,'' said
Kroll at M.D. Anderson, who now uses the fat-only method on 70
percent of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   The twins hope their unusual experience alerts cancer patients
to the little-known option -- after all, most women have enough of
their own fat to use.
</P>
<P>
   Culbreath twice tried breast implants after her 1998 mastectomy,
but infection set in and her radiation-damaged skin couldn't fight
it.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said her 101-pound runner's body was too skinny for
tissue reconstruction, but Liddell half-jokingly offered a fat
transplant -- and doctors jumped. Since the 46-year-old twins are
identical except for the extra 20 pounds three pregnancies had left
Liddell, Culbreath could use her fat and skin without fear of
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Because Liddell's tummy tuck cut no muscle, she was walking
pain-free hours later. And Culbreath left the LSU hospital
thrilled: ''Implants are great, but I feel like this is better. ...
It's actual tissue, it feels just like the other breast.''

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 2 Missing in Va. Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADFORD, Va. (AP) -- Search dogs Monday located the bodies of two
women under mounds of debris in an auto parts factory where an
explosion also killed a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   The blast at New River Castings on Sunday night threw clouds of
black soot over a wide area and left the building still smoldering
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's mass destruction, a hole the size of a football field
in the center of the plant,'' Fire Chief Lee Simpkins said. He
estimated damage at $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers and search dogs worked their way through charred,
twisted metal in the factory. The dogs discovered that the women
were buried under ''a tremendous amount of debris'' -- so much that
it will take days to get to them, said Dan Crumrine, a dog handler.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our priority is to find and remove these loved ones,''
Simpkins said. ''This is going to be a long process, it's not going
to be done overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials and fire officials said they didn't know the
cause of the explosion. Officials from the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration were on the scene. Radford is about 160 miles
west of Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and maintenance workers found the body of Curtis
Grooms, 29, near the core of the explosion. The missing women were
identified as Karen Anderson Hamilton, 35, and Debbie Sheppard, 37.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 workers were in the plant when the blast sent orange
flames as high as 20 feet in the air. One of them was Hamilton's
husband of six months, Buford Douglas Hamilton, who was working on
a forklift when the explosion happened but was uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   With soot still in his ears from the blast, he said he tried to
find his wife, and planned to wait outside the plant until she was
found.
</P>
<P>
   As many as six workers were hospitalized, with two still in
serious condition Monday. Other workers were treated for smoke
inhalation and cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Max Horton, 41, of Bluefield, W.Va., was working Sunday night
about 40 feet from the missing women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next thing I know there was a fireball looking at me square in
the face,'' he said after being treated at a hospital and released.
''There was an explosion and it was lights out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   New River Castings and a related parts manufacturer, Radford
Foundry, are owned by Troy, Mich.-based Intermet Corp., which
employs about 1,000 people in Radford. The two plants, which make
transmissions and other iron parts for the auto industry, cover
several blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the saddest day of my life,'' said John Doddridge,
Intermet's chief executive. ''Buildings are replaceable. People are
not.''

<HEADLINE> Monday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another day, another nine-year high for oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil surged to its latest in a series of high-water marks
Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, extending its advance
above $32 a barrel as supply disruptions from the North Sea and
Nigeria further tightened fast-dwindling stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Other energy commodities also gained.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, corn and hogs rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery rose to as much
as $32.20 a barrel before settling up 67 cents at $32.18 -- the
highest closing price since Nov. 29, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 percent jump resulted in part from news that Norway's
state-owned Statoil has reduced output from its North Sea fields
due to bad weather that has limited loadings and left storage
facilities almost full, and that Nigerian oil workers' strike has
interrupted loadings in that country.
</P>
<P>
   With world crude stockpiles just above 23-year lows, any
interruption in supplies has a disproportionate impact on the tight
market.
</P>
<P>
   Growing resistance by some oil producers to a production
increase also contributed to the price surge. Iran's oil minister
was quoted as saying there's no need to raise production, and Libya
and Algeria echoed his sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a market that needs every barrel,'' said John Kilduff,
senior vice president of energy risk management at Fimat USA Inc.
''Those types of statements and developments just help to send
prices higher until we see oil coming.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC nations, he speculated, would like to see prices closer to
$35 a barrel before they make their long-expected announcement that
the cartel will raise production. That would result in the extra
oil dropping prices back to no lower than $25 a barrel, rather than
the low $20s that some had predicted earlier.
</P>
<P>
   April heating oil also gained, rising .56 cent to 79.45 cents a
gallon; April unleaded gasoline rose .64 cent to 98.25 cents a
gallon; April natural gas rose 2.5 cents to $2.85 per 1,000 cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, April Brent crude from the North Sea rose 64 cents to
$29.63 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Record high temperatures soaring into the 70s in the Midwest
heightened concerns about dry soil as the spring growing season
draws closer, sending corn higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Unusually dry weather has enveloped the region since late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it's warm and you don't have much soil moisture, you
begin looking ahead,'' said Allen Dever, grains analyst for Doane
Agricultural Services in St. Louis. ''This year we've been worrying
quite a bit because the soil moisture is depleted.''
</P>
<P>
   May corn rose 3\ cents to $2.28} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Other grains also were higher. May wheat rose 2{ cents to $2.60{
a bushel, May oats rose \ cent to $1.18} a bushel and May soybeans
rose 4\ cents to $5.17\ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, heavy buying by commodity funds pushed hog prices
higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Analysts cited several
possible reasons for the surge -- higher packer bids for hogs,
insufficient inventories and hog health problems in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   April lean hogs rose .80 cent to 60.15 cents a pound. Frozen
pork bellies, while climbing less sharply, set contract highs amid
a lack of deliverable supplies. May pork bellies rose .23 cent to
94 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 196.70; Nasdaq Dips  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Monday, blocking a Nasdaq
run at 5,000, as investors still mindful of higher interest rates
locked in some of last week's big gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slid 196.70 to 10,170.50,
wiping out nearly all of Friday's 202-point jump.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index turned lower late in the day and fell
9.94 to 4,904.85 by the close of trading. Earlier, the
technology-dominanted index rose as high as 4,980.14, flirting with
the 5,000 mark just two months after it first crossed 4,000 and
four months after it passed 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other broad-market indexes were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 17.89 to 1,391.28, but the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 3.76 to a record 601.64.
</P>
<P>
   There was little initial reaction to a midday speech by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, whose comments reinforced
expectations the Fed will keep raising interest rates to slow the
economy and combat inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed already has raised rates four times since last June.
Last Friday, a report showing moderating job growth offered one of
the first signs that the Fed is succeeding in its goal. The report
bolstered investor confidence and sent stock prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, speaking at a Boston College conference, noted that
higher borrowing costs for businesses were prompting many analysts
to predict a slowdown in the stock market's advance. Still, he
added, strong productivity gains could still push corporate profits
and stocks higher, a suggestion that more rate hikes may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan's remarks did not trigger an immediate selloff,
interest rate worries began to build again as the session wore on.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell 4 9/16 to 103 1/16 and Microsoft fell 5{ to 90| to lead
the decline in the Dow, which last week gained 505 points to halt a
drop below 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But another Dow stock, Hewlett-Packard, rose 6 15/16 to 145 9/16
after its Agilent Technologies unit unveiled new optical
technologies that can speed up the Internet. Agilent, still 85
percent owned by H-P after a partial spinoff last year, soared 48{
to 145 9/16 on the news.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, technology stocks fared better than the overall
market, continuing to defy expectations that the high-flying group
will eventually succumb to the same worries nagging the broad
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's looking for it, but not today. Tech shares are
still looking remarkably vibrant,'' said Robert Streed, who manages
the Northern Select Equity Fund for Chicago-based Northern Trust.
''The continued dramatic outperformance of the technology stocks is
surprising. They almost seem to be in a market of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, Advanced Micro Devices rose 6{ to 48 amid news
the company has begun shipping a computer chip that can run at 1
gigahertz per second. Internet Capital Group rose 23 3/16 to 142\
after Banc Boston Robertson Stephens raised its rating on the Web
investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 ratio on the
New York Stock Exchange, but Nasdaq decliners led by only a narrow
margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.28 billion shares, down from
1.42 billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.7 percent,
Germany's DAX index rose 0.02 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose
1.24 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.49 percent.

<HEADLINE> Safety-Kleen Suspends Officers  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Safety Kleen Corp., one of the nation's
largest recyclers of industrial waste, suspended its top officers
Monday and said an internal investigation of accounting practices
may cause it to restate previous earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That news sent Safety-Kleen's shares tumbling by nearly 45
percent when they finally opened on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares closed at $2, down $1.62{.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Kenneth W. Winger; Michael J. Bragagnolo, the
executive vice president and chief operating officer; and Paul R.
Humphreys, the chief financial officer, were put on administrative
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Safety-Kleen said board members recently received information
alleging possible accounting irregularities that may have affected
financial results since fiscal 1998. A special committee of four
outside directors will head the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking these allegations very seriously,'' David
Thomas, who heads Safety-Kleen's executive committee, said in a
statement. If the investigation proves the allegations are true,
''we will take all appropriate actions to correct previously issued
financial statements.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did not specify how it learned of the problems and
Henry Taylor, Safety-Kleen's top lawyer, was not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Winger was paid about $797,213 in salary and bonuses in fiscal
1999, which ended in August. Bragagnolo was paid about $453,425 and
Humphreys about $353,380.
</P>
<P>
   All three were veterans of Laidlaw Environmental Services, which
merged with Rollins Environmental Services in 1997 and later took
over Safety-Kleen, then based in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw Inc., the parent company based in Canada that owns 44
percent of Safety-Kleen stock, has since said it wants to sell its
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Avi Dalfen, an analyst at Research Capital Corp. in Toronto,
cited problems getting financial information as he dropped coverage
of the company last week. ''We have been repeatedly frustrated by
the futility of our attempts to gain a better understanding of the
prospects for the company,'' Dalfen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dalfen said Safety-Kleen dropped plans to meet with him and
would not agree to meet with other analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Safety-Kleen reported earnings of $94.7 million for 1999,
compared with a net loss of $17.9 million a year earlier. One-time
charges affected the 1998 results.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Fined $20,000  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fund-raising arm of the Senate Republicans
agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty for using unregulated soft money to
help elect GOP congressional candidates, according to documents
released Monday by the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, agreed to pay a
$5,000 penalty for accepting a contribution from a national bank,
in violation of federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing weeks of the 1994 campaign, in which the
Republicans gained control of the Senate, the National Republican
Senatorial Committee gave $175,000 in soft money to the National
Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion group, to conduct
get-the-vote-drives in Pennsylvania, Minnesota and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Senate candidates benefiting from the get-out-the-vote
drive were Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania and Rod Grams in
Minnesota, both of whom won their races. The FEC said the
candidates did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money -- unlimited donations from corporations, unions and
individuals -- cannot be used to directly aid federal candidates.
But under federal law, political parties can use soft money to pay
part of the cost of activities that jointly benefit candidates
running for federal offices and candidates running for state and
local offices. Almost two-thirds of the cost must be paid for with
money raised under federal contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   By giving the money to the anti-abortion group rather than
conducting the get-out-the-vote drive itself, the NRSC was able to
get around the restrictions on using soft money, the FEC alleged.
</P>
<P>
   NRSC officials denied any wrongdoing, but agreed to settle the
case to avoid going to court.

   ''The NRSC firmly believes that it would prevail on the merits
if this matter proceeded to litigation and that no civil penalty
would have been assessed even if a court agreed with the
commission's new interpretation of the law, but simply put, seven
years of your process was penalty enough,'' general counsel Craig
Engle wrote the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying the penalty, the NRSC agreed to transfer
$88,207.60 in money raised under federal contribution limits to its
soft money account.

   On the Democratic side, the DNC was fined $5,000 for accepting a
$50,000 check from Hamilton Bank. As a national bank, the
institution cannot contribute to political parties, though it can
give to a party building fund. In this case, however, the
contribution was placed in the party's soft money account.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution was solicited by veteran Democratic fund-raiser
Howard Glicken, a friend of Vice President Al Gore. Glicken earlier
was fined $40,000 by the FEC for soliciting campaign donations from
a foreigner and arranging a contribution in a phony name. He also
pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors in a deal with the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force.

<HEADLINE> Hain To Buy Celestial Seasonings  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) --Hain Food Group, a heavyweight in the $20
billion natural food market, is acquiring specialty tea maker
Celestial Seasonings for about $332 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the deal,
which also includes Hain's assumption of about $7.8 million in
debt. The combined company will be the Hain Celestial Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Simon, president and chief executive officer of the Hain
Food Group, will be chairman, president and CEO of the new company,
while Mo Siegel, founder and chairman of Celestial Seasonings, will
be vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to approval by regulators and by
stockholders of both companies. It is expected to be completed by
June.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said the merger creates a ''powerhouse'' in the natural
foods industry. The companies' combined distribution systems will
expand each partner's reach. The Boulder-based Celestial Seasonings
sells primarily through mass-market retailers while Hain sells
mostly through natural foods retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Uniondale, N.Y.-based Hain said the merger will strengthen
its position in the natural foods industry. Hain said it has a
major share in 12 of the top 15 categories in the industry, and
owns such brands as Hain Pure Foods, Westbrae and Westsoy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Celestial Seasonings' sales of specialty teas were in
excess of $100 million, representing a 50 percent market share in
the herbal tea segment and 32 percent of the total specialty tea
category. The teas are sold in 41 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Combined revenue for the two companies is expected to be about
$430 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, 1.265 shares of Hain common
stock will be exchanged for each outstanding Celestial Seasonings
share.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. natural and organic food market represents a $20
billion business growing 15 to 18 percent annually. The U.S. market
for natural and organic foods includes $12 billion in sales in
natural and organic food shops and $8 billion through traditional
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Hain fell $4.75 to $27.62{ in trading at 4 p.m. on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, while shares of Celestial dropped $2 to
$33.50.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Modestly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell modestly after Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested again that more interest rates
will be needed to slow the hot U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/16 point, or
$1.87{ cents per $1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves
inversely to prices, rose to 6.14 percent from Friday's 6.13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments in a speech Monday largely confirmed
traders expectations that the Fed would raise rates at its next
meeting March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurys prices did recover from more severe losses as traders
moved out of sinking stocks. Stocks fell after Greenspan said the
economy would cool off faster if the stock market lost some of its
zip.The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 200 points as
investors succumbed to interest rate fears and took profits after
last week's 500 point rise.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were down 1/16, while
intermediate term securities were down [ to 3/16, according to
Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.83 percent, with the
discount up 0.03 percentage point from Friday to 5.66 percent.
Six-month bills yielded 6.08 percent, as the discount rose 0.05
percentage point to 5.81 percent. One-year yields were 6.19
percent, with the discount rising 0.03 percentage point to 5.83
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was unchanged at 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 93 1/32.
The yield to maturity of the index rose to 6.15 percent from
Friday's 6.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> 30 Die in Paraguay Bus-Truck Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- A tour bus traveling through dense fog
in the Paraguayan countryside slammed head-on into a cargo truck
Monday, killing 30 people, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus carrying Paraguayan and Chilean passengers from the
eastern border town of Ciudad del Este to Asuncion, Paraguay's
capital, crashed in the early morning hours. At least 45 people
were on board at the time of the crash, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio Gonzalez, one of the survivors, told local radio from a
hospital that the collision occurred while most of the passengers
were sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he and several other passengers escaped through
the windows of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twelve of us were saved because we were in the back of the
bus,'' he said. ''We aren't sure how the crash was caused, but it
could have been the fog. We heard a loud crashing sound and people
began to cry and call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   He said several cars stopped to help, and carried some of the
injured to the nearby city of Coronel Oviedo, 91 miles east of
Asuncion, where they called authorities for help.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala, Belize Game Relocated  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELCHOR DE MENCOS, Guatemala (AP) -- The villages here have names
like Winds of Sand and Pasture of Flowers. Horses, roosters and an
occasional pig wander lazily along the only road as it meanders
through the picturesque mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the obvious backdrop for an international conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But with the recent revival of a century-old territorial dispute
between Belize and Guatemala, the sleepy border between the two
countries has become the center of one of the most intense
international disputes in Central America since the civil wars of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It began last fall, when Belize's border police killed two
Guatemalan peasants. Then it was fanned Feb. 24 when Guatemala
arrested three soldiers and a police officer from Belize who had
crossed the often indistinguishable border carrying dozens of
machine guns and pistols. They were released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Belize City, soldiers have guarded Guatemala's embassy after
a bomb was discovered last week under a car parked nearby -- and in
case the frequent anti-Guatemalan demonstrations there get out of
hand. Guatemalan police have also been keeping a close eye on
Belize's embassy in Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   Said Musa, Belize's prime minister, claims the military
contingent facing illegal weapons charges never crossed the border
and was illegally stopped in Belize's territory.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the dispute heats up between officials from the two
nations, people who live here say things have never been more
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''These rumors about soldiers from here or soldiers from there
sneaking around the border is a lie,'' said Ruben Pita, an exporter
who lives and works in Melchor de Mencos, a tiny village on the
Guatemalan side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   At Melchor's border station, one of only two major crossing
points along the 135-mile border, backpackers clad in shorts and
sandals outnumber border guards. Soldiers from either nation are
nowhere in sight. The border is mostly unmarked, save for the
occasional metal gate.
</P>
<P>
   But in nearby Santa Elena, Guatemala, where the four prisoners
were held, officials from Belize weren't quite as nonchalant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hoping this won't strain relations in any way, but we
also know that these men did nothing wrong,'' said Eamon H.
Courtenay, a trade ambassador from Belize's embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Areualol, head of Guatemala's military forces for the
border state of Peten, said the arrests were necessary to protect
the rights of Guatemalans who may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are already doing everything to stop the Belizean
progression into Guatemalan territory and to stop their disregard
for the rights of our citizens,'' he said. ''The arrests are an
important part of those actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests may have been in retaliation for two Guatemalan
citizens killed by Belize's border officials in the past nine
months. Guatemala says the two men were simple laborers who were
minding their own business. Belize says one was a drug dealer who
attacked police and that an investigation into the slaying of the
other cleared their officials of all wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   With the deaths and the arrests, a quick solution to the
conflict seems unlikely. These two nations have been down the road
of conflict before, never resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Guatemala pondered declaring war on Belize -- which was
still a British colony -- claiming the whole nation constituted
Guatemalan territory lost in 1850 in a vain attempt by Britain and
the United States to divide former colonies in the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that British soldiers were going nowhere,
all talk of war was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions again ran high with Belize's independence in 1982.
Guatemalan authorities claimed the British had mistakenly awarded
4,600 square miles of territory to Belize when drawing up the new
nation's borders.
</P>
<P>
   In what officials here say was a 1992 sign of good will,
Guatemala agreed to recognize Belize's borders.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, officials on both sides are continuing to sing the
praises of peace and of maintaining the tranquility of places like
Melchor de Mencos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is too laid back here for any real threat of anything
happening,'' said Marc Sandoval, a truck driver from across the
border in Belize.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Activist Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- A Long Island breast cancer advocate
who recorded a radio ad for Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush is being criticized by fellow activists who
questioned whether the issue should have been politicized.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has said the campaign commercial falsely
accused him of opposing women's health programs, including those
for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Geri Barish, who heads the group ''1 in 9: the Long Island
Breast Cancer Action Coalition,'' said Monday that she is prepared
to ''take the heat'' over the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Advocating for breast cancer on Long Island is like being in
the hottest kitchen on earth,'' she said. ''You have to be able to
take the heat -- and I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Barish has built ''1 in 9'' into a formidable lobbying group,
with a $500,000 annual budget and a record of attracting millions
of dollars in government grants to research breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Breast cancer activism and politics are joined at the hip,''
she said. ''Without politics, there would be no funding. Without
politics, there would be no legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Long Island activists weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is totally inappropriate for one woman to use her name as a
platform to campaign on behalf of true breast cancer grass-roots
activists,'' Karen Miller, who heads the Huntington Breast Cancer
Coalition, told Newsday. ''We campaign for causes, not people.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Ford, president of the Brentwood/Bay Shore Breast Cancer
Coalition, accused Barish of ''usurping the power of the breast
cancer movement and allowing it to be used for a candidate, and
that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Barish countered: ''I have worked with practically every woman
on Long Island who is involved in the breast cancer issue, and all
of them have lobbied in Albany and Washington and praised the work
of some of the politicians they never even voted for.''

<HEADLINE> Lloyd's of London Fights Fraud Suit  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London began the fight of its 312-year
life Monday as a trial opened over the loss of $12.6 billion which
ruined a number of investors and prompted 30 of them to commit
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, a lawyer for the investors said
Lloyd's -- one of the most trusted names in insurance -- concealed
$6.3 billion in claims from asbestos-related illnesses while
reserving a tiny fraction of that amount to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Goldblatt charged that Lloyd's executives, faced with
massive liabilities and desperately in need of funds, persuaded
potential investors in the early 1980s that Lloyd's was a
well-regulated and prudent place for them to put their money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lloyd's lost $12.6 billion from 1988 to 1992, causing
financial ruin for many investors, known in the business as Names.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 Names, unable to cope with their share of the losses,
have killed themselves over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an institution you could not trust,'' said Goldblatt,
lead lawyer for the investors who accuse Lloyd's of massive fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The case filed by more than 230 Names -- including 24 Americans --
is being heard by Justice Peter Cresswell at London's Commercial
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuit, which seeks damages of up to $237 million, poses
a potentially mortal threat to Lloyd's.
</P>
<P>
   The suit could irreparably blacken the reputation Lloyd's has
nurtured as one of the world's premier insurance markets. Worse
still, a successful suit could open the floodgates to claims of
fraud from others.
</P>
<P>
   Goldblatt accused 33 senior Lloyd's executives of complicity in
the alleged cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's, whose coat of arms carries the motto ''Fidentia'' --
Latin for ''Utmost Good Faith'' -- denies any suggestion of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''These allegations are a rerun of what this dissident group of
Names has been saying in public on and off for over 10 years and
has failed to substantiate,'' Lloyd's chairman May Taylor said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe their case has any substance at all, and
Lloyd's is very confident of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's, which is a self-regulating market of insurance
syndicates rather than a company in its own right, noted that the
government's Serious Fraud Office reviewed these allegations in
1992 but decided not to take further action.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's relies on more than 30,000 Names -- mostly private
individuals -- who provide the money for underwriting insurance. In
successful syndicates, they earn annual returns; in troubled
syndicates, they can lose all of their investment and be liable for
a share of the overall loss.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Poole, a Cambridge lawyer who became a Name in 1982,
claims due to asbestos-related illnesses cost him more than $4
million -- and his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife just couldn't stand the pressure any longer and got
out and took as much as she could with her, which just increased
the strain,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who have been decimated by Lloyd's must strive to
continue resisting the complete erosion of their morale by the
architects of their financial disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos-related insurance claims in the United States began to
mount in the 1970s and 1980s. It was then, claimants in the lawsuit
allege, that Lloyd's began to recruit large numbers of new
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's made it easier for them to join by changing its rules to
let new Names pledge their homes as collateral for policies they
underwrote and for which they were personally liable.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, syndicates that were heavily exposed to claims
by victims of asbestosis and lung cancer caused by asbestos fibers
had to ''stretch credibility to the limit'' to appear solvent,
Goldblatt argued.
</P>
<P>
   They juggled their books, and some even broke with Lloyd's
normal practice and refused to reserve against such claims so as to
avoid showing a loss, he alleged. Those that did reserve against
asbestos-related liabilities put aside a total of just $32 million,
or 0.5 percent of Lloyd's total exposure to these claims, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Names ... were being told to rely both globally and at the
syndicate level on figures that told one story and meant another,''
Goldblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations may have political ramifications. Lloyd's is
immune to lawsuits, except in cases of proven fraud, thanks to the
Lloyd's Act passed by Parliament in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   However, Goldblatt suggested that Lloyd's executives withheld
crucial information about its beleaguered finances from members of
Parliament's House of Commons, who hotly debated the bill before
making it law.

<HEADLINE> Mexico University Building Seized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A month after police broke up a nearly
yearlong strike at Latin America's largest university, more than
100 rebellious students seized the rector's building Monday,
screaming at workers to get out and spraying walls with graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 strikers who covered their faces to hide their
identities screamed at university employees to evacuate the
building and forcibly removed some of the reporters and
photographers who tried to cover the takeover, reported Mexican
broadcast stations and the government news agency Notimex.
</P>
<P>
   As they herded workers out of the building in single file, the
protesters chanted ''political prisoners, liberty,'' and ''de la
Fuente's resignation now,'' a reference to recently appointed
rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente. Fuente took the helm of the school
after the strike forced the previous rector to resign.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 strike sympathizers waiting outside the building said
they were trying to determine whether the takeover was going to
last or was only a brief symbolic action to demonstrate that the
strikers' movement was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers had occupied and effectively paralyzed academic
activity at the university from April 20 until Feb. 6, when they
were ousted by a dawn police raid in which hundreds were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at the 270,000-student National Autonomous
University, known as UNAM, was led by radicals who saw it as a
struggle against global free-market economics. It began as a
protest against tuition increases but continued long after
officials rescinded them.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing detention of some of those arrested in the raid
has served as a rallying cry for the ousted strikers.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente has pledged to set up a special commission to
oversee preparations for a congress to discuss the future of the
troubled university.

<HEADLINE> FEMA Urges Floyd Victims To Move  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Although Princeville residents plan to
rebuild the tiny historic town that was nearly destroyed by
Hurricane Floyd, emergency management officials said Monday they
might be better off accepting government buyouts and moving away.
</P>
<P>
   The town has decided to repair its Tar River dike. But that will
not protect Princeville from another hurricane like Floyd, said
John Copenhaver, regional director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have the same event this year, it will have the same
result,'' Copenhaver said at a briefing on flood recovery efforts
six months later. ''We've found it is much easier to move people
out of harm's way than to move harm out of people's way.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain across
eastern North Carolina. It nearly destroyed Princeville, wiping out
850 homes in the town of 2,100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents still haven't returned, and the town government
continues to operate from trailers across the Tar River in Tarboro.
</P>
<P>
   Town officials decided in December to ask the Army Corps of
Engineers to repair the dike. That made the town ineligible for
buyouts because the dike gives protection from what is known as a
300-year flood. Floyd, however, produced flooding categorized as a
500-year flood.
</P>
<P>
   Princeville, considered the oldest U.S. town chartered by
blacks, was established as Freedom Hill at the end of the Civil War
by former slaves who settled alongside the Tar River under the
protection of Union troops.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton created a special council that
will recommend steps to take to safeguard the town from future
foods.
</P>
<P>
   While spending money to elevate their houses would help
residents escape flooding on the scale that followed Floyd, FEMA
officials say selling the property and moving is the best solution.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina officials estimate 57,000 structures were damaged
by Floyd, and that 24,000 of those were destroyed or left
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,300 pieces of property are in line to be purchased
and demolished at a cost of about $231 million, said Eric Tolbert,
state emergency management director.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the largest single buyout project in the history
of North Carolina and in FEMA,'' Copenhaver said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Militiamen Appeal Rejected  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court on Monday rejected an
appeal from fighters in an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia to grant
them political asylum if Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came a day after Israel's Cabinet unanimously voted
to withdraw from Lebanon by July, with or without security
guarantees from Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The militiamen fear that without Syrian guarantees of quiet in
the south, they will be vulnerable to revenge attacks by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israel in a border
zone Israel occupies to protect its northern towns. The
2,500-member South Lebanon Army is paid and trained by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who commanded
Israel's forces in Lebanon under former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, warned that a pullout would create a vacuum that could end
in ''mutual slaughters.'' He said fighters might take arms against
Israel to recover their legitimacy in the eyes of Hezbollah and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has promised to ensure the militiamen's safety, pledging
in Sunday's Cabinet statement not to abandon them or their
families. But officials have refused to elaborate on safety
arrangements, and Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said last
week that they would not be given asylum in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A senior security official, speaking Monday on condition of
anonymity, said, however, that the army was making plans to
resettle some SLA fighters in Israel as well as in other countries.
He said militiamen, their families, and Lebanese citizens who
collaborated with Israel would be categorized according to the
level of risk they faced and would be protected accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The most senior SLA officers have been sentenced to death in
absentia by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said the militiamen could re-appeal if they
were not satisfied once security arrangements materialize.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli lawyer Zvi Rish, who submitted the appeal last year
on behalf of three SLA fighters and their families, said the
militiamen deserved more than just vague promises.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to know, at a minimum, that if they are not
comfortable with the arrangements, we are willing to give them
political asylum in Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the uncertainty has led many militiamen to desert,
partly blaming Hezbollah's recent military successes on information
supplied by former SLA militiamen trying to buy a secure future
with Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> MGM Grand, Mirage Reach $4.4B Deal  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Casino giant MGM Grand, Inc. is buying rival
Mirage Resorts, Inc. for $4.4 billion cash in a deal that appears
to leave flamboyant Mirage chairman Steve Wynn on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, announced Monday, creates what one casino analyst
described as ''a juggernaut of a company'' with 14 properties and
about 1,000 acres of land for development in three states.
</P>
<P>
   The assets range from Mirage's $1.6 billion Bellagio resort to
MGM's 5,005-room MGM Grand, the nation's largest hotel. MGM also
assumes $2 billion in Mirage debt.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Chairman J. Terrence Lanni said Wynn would not be a part of
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ''He neither asked for a position in the combined company, nor
did we offer him a position,'' Lanni told The Associated Press. ''I
think whatever Steve decides to do, he's going to be staggeringly
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the two companies wrapped up the deal at dawn
Monday after extensive negotiations that began Thursday in a
meeting between Mirage president Bobby Baldwin and MGM Grand
executives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck after Baldwin asked MGM to up the ante $1
billion to $21 a share. MGM had offered $17 a share, or $3.3
billion, on Feb. 23 but had been rebuffed by Mirage's board.
</P>
<P>
   MGM executives agreed to the current deal after the stock market
closed Friday, and intensive negotiations continued through the
weekend on details.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction must be approved by Mirage stockholders and is
expected to close by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Wall Street had speculated that Wynn would play a role
in the new company. While he has a hands-on, flashy style,
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, MGM's majority stockholder, keeps to
the background.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, a casino analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., said he'd
been told by MGM executives that Wynn would not be involved in
operations in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve's at the point in his life when he's considering
pursuing other options,'' Ader said. ''He'll always be the chairman
of Las Vegas and the casino industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, 58, owns 23 million shares of Mirage stock or 12 percent
of the company. The deal would bring him $483 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn did not immediately return a telephone call; a Mirage
spokesman said Wynn would not speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Lanni said the acquisition gives MGM ''a dream combination of
assets and people, a combination that creates unquestionably the
premier company in the gaming industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Wynn said the deal ''fully embraces the value of
the franchise created by each of the Mirage properties.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected the new company will retain the MGM name.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies will include 14 properties. Mirage owns
the Bellagio, Mirage, Treasure Island and Golden Nugget resorts in
Las Vegas, Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Miss. and the Golden Nugget in
Laughlin, Nev. The company also owns half interest in the Monte
Carlo hotel-casino here.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand's properties include the MGM, New York-New York, three
properties at Primm, Nev. and casinos in Detroit and Darwin,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also have extensive undeveloped acreage in
Nevada, New Jersey and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Roffman, an industry analyst with Roffman Miller
Associates, said the merger would give MGM ''a major part of the
Strip and control of a major part of the hotel base. It would also
give them an entree to Atlantic City,'' where Mirage is developing
a megaresort.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn started the megaresort boom here with the opening of the
flagship Mirage in 1989, sparking a casino splurge that made Las
Vegas the fastest-growing city in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian built what was the largest hotel in the world here
three times -- first the International, which is now the Las Vegas
Hilton; the former MGM Grand, now Ballys-Las Vegas, and the current
MGM Grand, the world's largest when it opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Mirage were up $2.68} to $18.56\ at 4:30 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange, where MGM's stock rose 50 cents to $19.50.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Wives' Different Styles  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cindy McCain, Tipper Gore and Ernestine Bradley are known as the
charismatic campaigners, the ones who look as comfortable on the
stump as their husbands. But Laura Bush can hold her own, too.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing her husband at a recent appearance, she used the
chance to catch him up on things at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''First, I can report to George and to you that the girls got
off to school just fine this morning, and I fed the cats before I
left,'' she said, as the audience laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The five candidates' wives -- Jocelyn Marcel Keyes, the fifth,
runs a soup kitchen in Montgomery County, Md. -- have plenty in
common as the spouses of men running hard for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Where they differ is in approach.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain is the bright-eyed daughter of an Arizona beer
distributor, while Tipper Gore bubbles like a school girl still
fawning over her college sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley, a native German, makes audiences laugh with
occasional slips like saying she opposes the military's ''don't
talk, don't tell'' policy toward gay soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush is more reserved, reflecting her past as a public
school librarian. Jocelyn Keyes is often away from the presidential
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Mrs. Bush was asked what type of first lady she'd be
if her husband, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, were elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Would she be like her mother-in-law, former first lady Barbara
Bush? Or perhaps like Hillary Rodham Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   In an answer similar in tone to all of her fellow spouses, she
said: ''I'll just be Laura Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain, married to Sen. John McCain, says that on the
campaign trail, ''My first and foremost role is to protect my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the one who gets cranky when the schedule is too long, the
day is too long, he's not fed properly and I feel like he's being
pulled in too many directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, snaps pictures from
the stage at campaign events for the family photo album. After an
early important win, she grabbed the microphone and yelled: ''New
Hampshire, you rock!''
</P>
<P>
   Her public warmth helps offset his famously stiff demeanor. When
she introduces him, he has his arm around her and she puts her hand
on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley is upbeat on the trail, in contrast to her
more somber husband, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   A professor at Montclair State University in New Jersey who
specializes in the Holocaust, she can charm crowds with her
intellect, light accent and occasional malapropisms.
</P>
<P>
   She spots people in the crowd who have met Bill and gives them a
long hug, reminding him to say hello. She gets some of her biggest
applause by good-naturedly putting him in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill is really a very sweet husband,'' she said, ''but he
always forgets to introduce me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush often stays in the background, napping while her
husband speaks with reporters on a campaign plane or sitting
quietly by his side at news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keyes, the wife of Alan Keyes, on some days ladles out soup
and dispenses advice at the soup kitchen she runs. Usually, though,
she's at home, raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with the children is a major question for full-time
candidates and their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Cindy McCain said she made the decision to go
almost full-time on the campaign trail recently ''because it's very
important that I'm with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family life is now on public display, as she disciplines the
kids via cellphone with people on the bus listening in. She
compares notes on child-raising techniques with members of the
press pool who are also parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''How is he doing this morning? How was his night?'' she asked
her housekeeper about a sick child recently, clutching her
cellphone tight to her ear.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Laura Bush has stayed closer to home. She and
her husband have twin 18-year-old daughters, both of whom are in
the midst of applying to college.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our girls are seniors and we're both already sort of teary
about the thought of them leaving,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not with her husband, she still keeps up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm not with George I'm much more anxious about the
campaign than when I'm on the trip with him,'' she said. ''And I
think that's why I call in during the day to see what's
happening.''

<HEADLINE> First of EgyptAir 990 victims identified  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The first of the 217 victims of EgyptAir
Flight 990 have been identified, four months after the plane
plunged into the ocean leaving no bodies intact.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Laposata, the Rhode Island medical examiner,
released a statement Monday that her office has determined the
identities of 14 of those aboard, paving the way for families to
bury their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those identified are from New Jersey: Gloria Berchielli
and Anne M. Soernssen, both of Jamesburg. They were residents of a
retirement village and were traveling together on an elder hostel
tour of Egypt. Five other New Jerseyans were on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Laposata has been overseeing the complex process of identifying
victims from 6,000 tissue fragments, most measured in just inches,
with no distinctive physical marks. DNA testing can be conducted on
just 1,300 fragments and results may not be ready for 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Medical, dental and fingerprint records were used to identify
the 14 victims -- all U.S. residents -- whose names were released
Monday. Laposata did not release details on returning the remains
to families.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service was held in November in Newport for all the
relatives and many already held private funerals.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct. 31 off the Massachusetts island
of Nantucket, killing everyone aboard. A salvage ship worked for a
week in December, raising the wreckage and remains off the ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board estimated 70 percent of
the aircraft, including one engine, and sections of the wings, tail
and body, was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NTSB Chairman James Hall said the second engine would
be raised. A civilian ship with an underwater robot is scheduled to
begin the task March 18, in a mission expected to last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said investigators want to see the
engine to ''cover all of our bases.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a good job on videotaping and taking pictures
underwater, but it can also help if we have it out of the water to
get a closer look at it,'' Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the ship also will be looking for flight control
components not recovered during the December salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
   The engines for the EgyptAir Boeing 767 were manufactured by
Pratt &AMP; Whitney, which sent investigators to Quonset Point, the
former Navy base in North Kingstown, where the wreckage is stored.
The company's experts completed their work at the site weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing that we have seen from the data or the video indicated
that there was any engine involvement in this thing,'' said Mark
Sullivan. ''If they (the NTSB) require us to come back to look at
the engine, of course we will.''
</P>
<P>
   After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit
voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said
in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could
have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has disputed reports that investigators are increasingly
convinced the jet was crashed deliberately, saying his agency must
conduct more studies before they settle on a cause.

packed up his clubs and headed for the golf course Monday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> US Defends Mozambique Relief Effort  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration plans to announce
debt relief for Mozambique, which has been ravaged by catastrophic
floods.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is to discuss details of the
additional debt relief for the southeast African nation Tuesday,
government officials said Monday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Under various international and U.S. initiatives, officials
said, some debt relief has been provided to the country. Specifics
of the additional relief Summers is expected to discuss were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, chafing under criticism of U.S. relief
efforts in Mozambique, rejected allegations that the United States
responded too slowly to the humanitarian crisis caused by the
widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James Foley said the critics should take into account
that many of the assets had to be redeployed from Europe to
southern Africa -- ''a major undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've deployed them as quickly as possible,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics believe the response should have been faster,
noting that assets are still being deployed more than two weeks
after the flooding reached crisis stage.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's former first lady, Graca Machel, spoke bitterly of
what many in southern Africa say were failures by the United States
and other Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems the world has no conscience when it comes to human
life,'' said Machel, the wife of former South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial round of flooding in early February, the U.S.
government concluded that regional search-and-rescue efforts would
be sufficient, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until February 25 that a second surge of water caused
rivers to overflow, a much greater disaster than had been initially
anticipated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he said, the U.S. Agency for International
Development activated a 24-hour operations center and begin
mobilizing the disaster assistance response team.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said AID contracted locally and quickly to hire three
helicopters and six fixed-wing airplanes, which began flying on
March 2. In recent days, he said, AID has contracted 11 civilian
helicopters and small aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a 14-member boat rescue operation from Metro Dade, Fla.,
began rescue and delivery operations Monday, and a five-member
Coast Guard team of water-rescue specialists will arrive shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Foley noted that President Clinton has authorized a drawdown of
$37.6 million in defense articles and services to support military
humanitarian assistance efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes an estimated six heavy lift helicopters and
small boats to conduct search-and-rescue operations, six C-130
aircraft to deliver relief supplies and command-and-control
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Foley estimated AID assistance to date at $12.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers hold landlord rights' bill while Miss America makes pitchfor homeless vets  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Just before Miss America Heather French
made a pitch to New Jersey lawmakers to help homeless veterans,
they held a bill that would have made it easier for landlords to
evict tenants.
</P>
<P>
   French made a plea to lawmakers to listen ''not only with their
ears, but with their hearts'' when they grapple with issues that
affect homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to her brief speech, Assembly House Committee chairman
John Kelly announced that the committee was holding a bill that
would have shortened the time it takes for landlords to put
delinquent tenants out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   French said she was unaware of the bill and couldn't comment on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was here today just to encourage them to listen with a more
lenient heart'' when issues affecting homeless vets come up.
French, whose father is a disabled Vietnam veteran, also appeared
at news conference at the Statehouse with Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we're really fortunate that Miss America came today
because they pulled the bill,'' said Phyllis Salowe-Kaye,
legislative vice president for the New Jersey Tenants Organization.
''Some of (the people affected by the bill) could actually be the
vets she's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, R-Morris, denied that Miss America's
presence had anything to do with the bill being tabled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, the chairman wanted to leave early,'' DeCroce said.
''I think it will probably go through next time out.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, A-1417, would have eliminated a three-day wait from
the time a landlord gets a court order to evict a tenant and when a
tenant can be physically removed from the property.
</P>
<P>
   Salowe-Kaye said those days are crucial to prevent homelessness,
giving tenants time to make alternative arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gotta get a mover,'' she said. ''They gotta get their
stuff together. People need time to make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But landlords say the eviction process can take weeks or months
and that's plenty of time for a tenant to find somewhere else to
live.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a problem in New Jersey when a landlord needs to evict
somebody,'' said Nathan Slovin, executive vice president of the New
Jersey Apartment Association. ''The process does take a little too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   French said there are 250,000 homeless veterans sleeping on the
nation's streets and 7,000 in New Jersey. She said she took up the
cause of homeless vets because her father, Ron French, 52, served
in the U.S. Marine Corps in Vietnam and was wounded in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old fashion designer carried her crown in a wooden
box. She also brought a purple heart that a veteran gave her during
her travels around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She first held up her crown, saying each rhinestone in the tiara
represents a veteran. Then, she showed lawmakers the purple heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day I show it to people as a symbol of what their
country is meant to be,'' said French, who has spoken to Congress
and other state lawmakers on behalf of homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
   She asked lawmakers to help provide affordable, permanent
housing for homeless vets.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have earned it,'' she said. ''It's time to bring them
home.'' French also praised New Jersey for its efforts to help
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said encampments, or ''stand-downs,'' for homeless
veterans would become a permanent annual event.
</P>
<P>
   These encampments are set up in parks to attract homeless
veterans in need of hot food, clean clothes, haircuts and perhaps a
visit with a counselor or doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Activists working with homeless veterans, especially those from
Vietnam, found that many of them distrust government agencies and
refuse to visit offices, but feel at home at encampments
reminiscent of their time in the service.

<HEADLINE> McCain supporter asks senator to stop mailing that raises Bob Jonesissue  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- One of John McCain's few big-name New York
supporters, state Sen. John Marchi of Staten Island, publicly asked
Monday that the Arizona senator stop his campaign from sending
mailings talking about Texas Gov. George W. Bush's visit to a
controversial South Carolina college.
</P>
<P>
   New York's primary is on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The flier says that Sen. John McCain ''had the political courage
to stand up against Bob Jones University and denounce its hateful,
bigoted anti-Catholic rhetoric.'' The reference is to Bush's visit
to the fundamentalist Christian school that just rescinded its ban
on interracial dating and whose leaders have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such campaign tactics are inconsistent with my perception of
your impressive record as a military man and as a leader in the
U.S. Senate,'' said Marchi, New York's senior state legislator and
a Roman Catholic. ''I sincerely hope that you will see to it that
attacks on Governor Bush, painting him with anti-Catholic views
will stop immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign complained about the mailings to Staten Island
Republicans on Sunday. Other campaign officials said Monday the
flier was showing up in Queens and Manhattan. Bryan Flood, a
spokesman for the McCain campaign, said then that McCain stands by
the flier.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has never said that he thinks Bush is antiCatholic, said
Guy Molinari, McCain's state chairman. ''There's no place in these
campaigns for religion,'' he said. ''There's no place in these
campaigns for rhetoric on breast cancer either.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been running ads in New York saying McCain has voted
against breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of 13 states with Republican primaries or
caucuses on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bush complained about calls made by the McCain camp
in Michigan that suggested Bush was anti-Catholic.

<HEADLINE> Former Dominican Leader Recovering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Former Dominican
President Juan Bosch was hospitalized over the weekend after
suffering an apparent seizure, doctors said Monday. He has since
regained the ability to walk and speak.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch, 91, was rushed to an Air Force hospital in Santo Domingo
on Saturday because of neurological problems, hospital director
Jose Alfredo Espanol told TVC television. He would not say when
Bosch might be released.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch has suffered a variety of health problems in recent years
and reportedly has Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch, a one-time Marxist, was elected president in 1962 after
the assassination of dictator Rafael Trujillo. He was then
overthrown by the army in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   When leftists tried to restore him to power in 1965, the United
States -- fearing another communist country like nearby Cuba --
invaded with 20,000 Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch ran for president several times in succeeding decades but
never regained office.

<HEADLINE> Fertility Doctor Jury Deadlocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal jury was unable to reach a verdict in
the insurance fraud trial of a prominent fertility doctor on
Monday, deadlocking after seven days of deliberations. A mistrial
was declared.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Niels Lauersen shook his lawyer's hand after the jury told
the judge that further deliberations would be futile.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Chung told the judge that the
government would seek a speedy retrial. U.S. District Judge William
H. Pauley said another trial might occur as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged Lauersen, an obstetrician and gynecologist,
stole more than $2 million from insurance companies over a 10-year
period by falsely billing fertility surgeries that were not covered
by insurance as gynecological surgeries that were.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore D. Wells, Lauersen's lawyer, said his 63-year-old
client was a target for prosecutors and the insurance companies
because he spoke out against the failure of most companies to pay
for fertility procedures.
</P>
<P>
   After the mistrial was declared, Lauersen declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen, the author of ''It's Your Body,'' has appeared
frequently on television and in publications as an expert on
fertility matters, which make up about 10 percent of his practice.

<HEADLINE> Soaring Gas Prices Worry Many  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer Keela Mangum, owner of Grand Canyon Trail Rides, was
forced to close up shop two months early when six of her mules died
of botulism. This year another malady threatens to wipe out her
livelihood: the exorbitant cost of unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   With the cost of fuel projected to surge past $1.70 a gallon
this summer, tourism officials and guides across the West worried
Monday that the usually booming summer travel season could be a
bust if motorists are unwilling to pay to drive long distances.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is kind of bleak looking for us,'' said Mangum, whose
family-run business provides mule rides into the Grand Canyon's
North Rim, 270 miles from the nearest airport in Las Vegas. ''We're
at the end of the world as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department on Monday predicted that gasoline prices,
already averaging about $1.50 for a gallon of unleaded, would
escalate to $1.75 to $1.80 a gallon during the summer because
production is not keeping pace with demand.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be worse. The period between Memorial Day
and Labor Day is typically the busiest driving season of the year,
with an estimated 270 million people hitting the road for vacation,
according to the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said that while many travelers
won't change their plans because of a few additional bucks a tank,
some could decide to stay closer to home and forgo trips to more
remote destinations such as national parks out West.
</P>
<P>
   ''If prices continue to move up and begin to reach the $2 a
gallon level, psychologically Americans may not be prepared to deal
with that and continue business as usual with the family budget,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what worries Eric Stevens, assistant manager of the
Pahaska Tepee motel outside of Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park.
The motel relies ''almost exclusively'' on the summer tourist
season, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to lose a segment of the population, but then
we'll pick up people we would never had seen,'' he said, predicting
that higher fuel costs also will raise airfares and force more
people to vacation domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials in Wallowa County, Ore., were less optimistic.
The remote corner of northeastern Oregon, which includes the Eagle
Cap Wilderness Area, John Day Fossil Loop, the Oregon Trail and
Hell's Canyon Recreation Area, relies heavily on business from
campers, hunters and anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Yasha Sturgill, deputy manager of the Wallowa County Chamber of
Commerce, said tourism already had slumped because of rising gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hear quite a few people complain about the price of gas
here,'' she said. ''Wallowa County will certainly suffer the
backlash of that.''

<HEADLINE> U S West, Qwest Settle For Merger OK  </HEADLINE>
By HUNTER T. GEORGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- To win approval of their merger, U S West
and Qwest Communications International reached a settlement with
state regulators that would freeze phone rates until 2004 and
establish financial incentives for quality control.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Monday requires the merged company to
improve the state's telecommunications network and to meet certain
quality standards or else pay customers as much as $20 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes a day after Qwest acknowledged talks with
Deutsche Telekom of Germany about a deal to acquire both Qwest and
U S West.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, which agreed in July to acquire U S West for stock now
worth $56 billion, issued a statement Sunday night confirming the
discussions without naming the company, which is reportedly
Germany-based Deutsche Telekom AG.
</P>
<P>
   U S West, which was kept in the dark about the negotiations,
threatened Friday to sue Qwest if the company backed out of its
contract. The fact that Qwest was discussing a deal with another
company raises questions about whether Qwest breached its agreement
with U S West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have recently been informed that Qwest has had
conversations with a major telecommunications company,'' U S West
General Counsel Mark Roellig said in a statement Sunday night. ''As
we indicated last week, these conversations were conducted without
our approval and we do not have any knowledge of the status or
substance of the conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom would not comment Monday on the developments
between Qwest and U S West, nor on whether it was in talks with
Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, chief executive Ron Sommer said in an
interview with Germany's Die Welt newspaper that his company is
planning a takeover soon and isn't ruling out a big acquisition. He
also reiterated that the U.S. market is very important for Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's statement Sunday said Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz, Qwest's principal shareholder, would support transactions
with the major telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Chairman Joseph Nacchio has been quoted in recent
newspaper stories saying the deal with U S West might not be
completed. He has also expressed concern about U S West's conflicts
with regulators in some of its 14-state territory, including
Colorado where it was ordered to refund $12.77 million to phone
customers for service-quality violations.
</P>
<P>
   U S West has said it will fight the order.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio, though, said Sunday that the merger agreement with U S
West is still in place and Qwest will not enter into any
transaction with the other company ''unless U S West reaches an
agreement with that company for the acquisition of U S West on
terms acceptable to it.''
</P>
<P>
   U S West remains committed to completing the merger with Qwest,
Roellig said.
</P>
<P>
   When U S West and Qwest first announced their deal in July, they
promised to create a powerful communications company with customers
in 14 states, and an aggressive Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nacchio wanted to acquire U S West so badly that he
launched a hostile bidding war to break up a merger agreement
between U S West and Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based company
building an undersea fiber-optic cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to employees Friday, U S West chairman, Solomon
Trujillo, ''pledged to fight for the interests of employees and
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo said last week that he would resign from the company
after the merger with Qwest closed.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of U S West were down 25 cents at $74.87{ at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange, where Qwest's stock was down $4 at
$60. Deutsche Telekom's shares were up 50 cents at $99.12{.
</P>
<P>
   U S West is Washington state's largest local telephone carrier,
serving 3 million residential and business phone lines. Qwest, also
based in Denver, is the nation's fourth-largest long-distance
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings on the settlement with Washington are set for next
month around the state, after which the Washington Utilities and
Transportation Commission will consider whether to approve the
deal.

<HEADLINE> After priest's murder, bill seeks to monitor mentally ill  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Nearly nine months after a manic
depressive was charged with murdering a Bristol priest, lawmakers
are considering a bill that would allow the state to monitor those
diagnosed with some mental illnesses to ensure they are taking
their medication.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother's death was the result of the act of someone's
violence,'' said Tom Lysz. ''If someone were looking after the
person who killed him and made sure he was taking his medication,
my brother may still be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Robert Lysz was bludgeoned to death with a candleholder at
St. Matthew Church on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Police have charged Michael Ouellette with murder, third-degree
burglary and credit card theft. According to an affidavit,
Ouellette told police he attacked Lysz, donned some priestly
garments, went into the rectory and went to sleep. Ouellette is
expected to be back in court in May.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette's family has said he suffers from manic-depression and
behaves erratically when he is not taking medication. Police said
Ouellette stopped taking the drugs months before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottle of medication was sitting on the front seat of
(Ouellette's) car,'' Tom Lysz said. ''But he said he didn't take it
because it upset his stomach. And there was no one doing anything
to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ann Dandrow, R-Southington, said the state Department of
Mental Health should make sure mentally ill people with violent
tendencies are under control. Under the legislation, case workers
would be required to check on patients to ensure they are taking
their prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's needed for the betterment of the individual and
the safety of society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Lysz's congregation rounded up support for the bill
through a petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to promote a bill that would protect society and
also protect the patient so that this thing would never happen
again,'' said Helen Lobaczewski.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the bill are bracing for criticism that the
proposal invades people's privacy and infringes on their rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Lysz and his 18-year-old son Will likened the bill
smoking bans aimed at preventing second-hand smoke and laws
requiring motorists and their passengers to wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ''My uncle would have supported this bill,'' said Will Lysz.
''It's just common sense protection for other people. It helps
people who need help, and that's what my uncle did.''

<HEADLINE> UConn Still No. 1 in Women's Poll  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Connecticut remained an overwhelming No. 1 choice Monday in The
AP women's basketball poll and is just one week from a season-long
run at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (28-1) received 40 of a possible 43 first-place
votes from a media panel and had 1,072 points. That was 44 more
than Tennessee (28-3), now alone at No. 2 after being tied with
Georgia last week.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (29-3) lost to Mississippi State in the semifinals of
the Southeastern Conference tournament and dropped to fourth.
Louisiana Tech (25-2), winner of 15 straight since a 90-63 loss to
Connecticut, climbed one spot to third.
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end of the poll, George Washington and Oregon both
returned after being ranked earlier in the season. Marquette and
Stanford dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   There was some reshuffling among the teams in the middle, mostly
the result of conference tournament action.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut routed Providence in the season finale and St.
John's in its first Big East tournament game to reach Monday
night's semifinals against No. 17 Boston College. Tennessee won the
SEC tournament for the fourth time in five years, beating
Mississippi State 70-67 in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, which also made the Big East semifinals, moved up
one spot to fifth and was followed by Texas Tech, Penn State,
Rutgers, UC Santa Barbara and Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech and Iowa State, which shared the Big 12
regular-season title with No. 18 Oklahoma, each moved up one spot.
Penn State fell two places after losing to No. 13 Purdue in the Big
Ten finals.
</P>
<P>
   Duke went from 12th to 11th and Mississippi State's strong
showing in the SEC tourney sent the Lady Bulldogs from 17th to
12th. Then it was Purdue, Old Dominion and LSU, followed by Auburn,
Boston College, Oklahoma, Virginia and North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane, Arizona, George Washington, Oregon and Michigan
completed the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington (25-4) was in the poll twice before this
season for one week -- No. 24 on Jan. 17 and 25th on Feb. 14. The
Colonials took a five-game winning streak into the Atlantic 10
finals against Xavier.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon (22-7) was ranked the first 10 weeks of the season,
reaching as high as 10th, before falling out after a 78-62 loss at
Stanford on Jan. 15. But the Ducks have won eight of their last
nine and would clinch at least a tie for the Pac-10 title if they
beat Oregon State at home in their regular season finale on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (19-7), which has been in and out of the poll all
season, fell out again from No. 25 after splitting on a trip to Los
Angeles, losing to UCLA and beating Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Marquette (22-6), 24th last week, dropped out after losing to
Alabama-Birmingham in the quarterfinals of the Conference USA
tournament. The Golden Eagles made the Top 25 for the first time
ever this season and had been ranked for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue matched Mississippi State for the biggest jump in the
poll with its move from 18th to 13th.

<HEADLINE> Casino giants close $4.4 billion deal; Mirage's Wynn not expectedto stay  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Casino giant MGM Grand, Inc. is buying rival
Mirage Resorts, Inc. for $4.4 billion cash in a deal that appears
to leave flamboyant Mirage chairman Steve Wynn on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, announced Monday, creates what one casino analyst
described as ''a juggernaut of a company'' with 14 properties and
about 1,000 acres of land for development in three states.
</P>
<P>
   The assets range from Mirage's $1.6 billion Bellagio resort to
MGM's 5,005-room MGM Grand, the nation's largest hotel. MGM also
assumes $2 billion in Mirage debt.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Chairman J. Terrence Lanni said Wynn would not be a part of
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ''He neither asked for a position in the combined company, nor
did we offer him a position,'' Lanni told The Associated Press. ''I
think whatever Steve decides to do, he's going to be staggeringly
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the two companies wrapped up the deal at dawn
Monday after extensive negotiations that began Thursday in a
meeting between Mirage president Bobby Baldwin and MGM Grand
executives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck after Baldwin asked MGM to up the ante $1
billion to $21 a share. MGM had offered $17 a share, or $3.3
billion, on Feb. 23 but had been rebuffed by Mirage's board.
</P>
<P>
   MGM executives agreed to the current deal after the stock market
closed Friday, and intensive negotiations continued through the
weekend on details.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction must be approved by Mirage stockholders and is
expected to close by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Wall Street had speculated that Wynn would play a role
in the new company. While he has a hands-on, flashy style,
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, MGM's majority stockholder, keeps to
the background.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, a casino analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., said he'd
been told by MGM executives that Wynn would not be involved in
operations in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve's at the point in his life when he's considering
pursuing other options,'' Ader said. ''He'll always be the chairman
of Las Vegas and the casino industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, 58, owns 23 million shares of Mirage stock or 12 percent
of the company. The deal would bring him $483 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn did not immediately return a telephone call; a Mirage
spokesman said Wynn would not speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Lanni said the acquisition gives MGM ''a dream combination of
assets and people, a combination that creates unquestionably the
premier company in the gaming industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Wynn said the deal ''fully embraces the value of
the franchise created by each of the Mirage properties.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected the new company will retain the MGM name.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies will include 14 properties. Mirage owns
the Bellagio, Mirage, Treasure Island and Golden Nugget resorts in
Las Vegas, Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Miss. and the Golden Nugget in
Laughlin, Nev. The company also owns half interest in the Monte
Carlo hotel-casino here.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand's properties include the MGM, New York-New York, three
properties at Primm, Nev. and casinos in Detroit and Darwin,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also have extensive undeveloped acreage in
Nevada, New Jersey and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Roffman, an industry analyst with Roffman Miller
Associates, said the merger would give MGM ''a major part of the
Strip and control of a major part of the hotel base. It would also
give them an entree to Atlantic City,'' where Mirage is developing
a megaresort.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn started the megaresort boom here with the opening of the
flagship Mirage in 1989, sparking a casino splurge that made Las
Vegas the fastest-growing city in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian built what was the largest hotel in the world here
three times -- first the International, which is now the Las Vegas
Hilton; the former MGM Grand, now Ballys-Las Vegas, and the current
MGM Grand, the world's largest when it opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Mirage were up $2.68} to $18.56\ at 4:30 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange, where MGM's stock rose 50 cents to $19.50.

<HEADLINE> Few Boeing Workers Report To Work  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A day after Boeing imposed part of its latest
contract offer and pleaded for striking engineers and technical
workers to come back, it appeared Monday that few had returned to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bofferding, executive director of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, said he did not
know of any workers who went back to work. Boeing spokesman Peter
Conte said there was no significant increase in the number of SPEEA
workers on the job Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some in management have this view that employees will blindly
follow whatever agreement management imposes,'' Bofferding said.
''I think that only makes us feel even more strongly about what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22,600 workers represented by the union in contract
talks, about 17,000 workers remained on strike Monday. They have
been on strike since Feb. 9, and three days of mediated talks fell
apart on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, the number of Boeing's commercial airplane
deliveries has been off by 50 percent or more, while military
contracts have been hurt as well, company officials say.
</P>
<P>
   After the company declared an impasse Wednesday, it was free to
impose part or all of its latest contract offer. The offer, as
imposed, gives technical workers a 2 percent guaranteed raise and
additional raises based on merit. Engineering employees do not
receive guaranteed raises, but could receive merit raises based on
a 6 percent salary pool.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing did not attempt to impose its revamped benefits package
on the workers, something that has been a strong point of
contention between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The new benefits package would require employees to start paying
part of their medical premiums, which the union opposes.
</P>
<P>
   The union disputes the claim that the two sides are at impasse
and has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.

<HEADLINE> Jet Skids Off Runway in California  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A day after a jet carrying 142 people
hurtled off a runway and skidded to a stop just short of a gas
station, everyone was talking more about what could have happened
than what did happen.
</P>
<P>
   After landing at Burbank from Las Vegas, Flight 1455 slammed
through a metal wall and fence Sunday evening in a cloud of smoke
and stopped with its nose just 39 feet short of the gas pumps at a
Chevron station on Hollywood Way.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-300 struck a car, pinning its
hood under the aircraft, but the driver and her 4-year-old daughter
weren't hurt. Fifteen passengers on the plane were slightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Airport shuttle bus driver Abayomi Omolewu said he and two other
drivers were waiting to be sent on a call when they saw the plane
blast through the fence and wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw it was going to crash into the gas station and the gas
station was going to get into a flame,'' he said Monday. ''That's
why we were like, 'Man, is that plane going to fall on us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Omolewu said he and the two other drivers ran. Omolewu turned
around to grab his cell phone, but because of the smoke, he
couldn't see to dial.
</P>
<P>
   As the noise subsided, Omolewu and others ran toward the plane,
where they helped frightened passengers climb down off the wing and
off an emergency chute.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-ton jetliner still had about 1,000 gallons of fuel in its
5,311-gallon tanks. Thousands of gallons of gas were stored at the
Chevron station. Although the plane leaked about 10 gallons of
fuel, there was no fire.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest called it the worst accident in its 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ''My feeling is they were very fortunate that it wasn't more
serious than it was,'' said Southwest CEO Herb Kelleher. The
airline, known for its bargain ticket prices, has never had a
fatality.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the cause of the crash was not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   The battered plane was hoisted by cranes Monday and towed to a
secure area of the airport. Cockpit data recorders were removed
from the aircraft and flown to the National Transportation Safety
Board's lab in Washington for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, a Southwest veteran since 1988 with more than 18,000
flying hours, will be interviewed Tuesday, said Jefferey R. Rich,
the NTSB's lead investigator. The weather was clear at the time of
the crash and the jet, built in 1985, had its last maintenance
check on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on a relatively short runway -- 6,032 feet -- at
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, northeast of downtown Los
Angeles. The runway is well known to arriving travelers, who have
to brace themselves for the rapid stop when thrust reversers and
brakes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on weight, flap configuration and runway conditions, a
Boeing 737-300 requires between 3,200 feet and 4,500 feet to land,
Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what the gross weight of that particular
airplane was,'' he said. ''There are a whole lot of things that go
into it. ... It depends on what flaps they were using, wet or dry
runway, on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the runway was long enough, Rich would only say:
''I wouldn't necessarily consider it short, I wouldn't consider it
long.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Over the counter remedies may impair driving more thanalcohol  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Over-the-counter medicines used by millions
of hay fever sufferers may affect a person's driving ability more
than alcohol, a study indicates.
</P>
<P>
   University of Iowa researchers who tested 40 allergy sufferers
in a driving simulator found that the standard dose of
antihistamine contained in Benadryl and many similar medicines had
a greater effect than a few drinks on driving ''coherence,'' or the
ability to match the speed of the vehicle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The antihistamine, diphenhydramine, also had an effect similar
to alcohol on steering stability and the likelihood of crossing
into the oncoming lane, according to the study in Tuesday's issue
of Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were quite surprised to find that diphenhydramine may have
an even greater impact on the complex task of operating an
automobile than does alcohol,'' said Dr. John M. Weiler, a
University of Iowa medical professor. ''That sends a chilling
message. You would not want to be on the road when someone is
driving at you who is taking these.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also looked at a newer antihistamine, fexofenadine,
used in the prescription drug Allegra. The researchers said that
when it came to driving ability, fexofenadine was indistinguishable
from a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said more than 39 million Americans suffer from
hay fever and allergies and 4.8 million take prescription drugs.
Most go without treatment or take over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   These medicines often come with warnings that they can cause
drowsiness and should not be used while operating heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration researcher
Richard Compton said that there had been too little research on the
effects of allergy medications on driving safety and that people
often ignore warnings about mixing them with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   However, Compton said a study of blood tests on victims of fatal
crashes in the early 1990s suggested that antihistamine impairment
was far less prevalent than alcohol impairment.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Benadryl, Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert
Co., attacked the new study as ''seriously flawed'' because it was
partially funded by Aventis, the maker of Allegra. Weiler strongly
defended his work, saying, ''I am not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers had 40 allergy sufferers ages 25 to 45 report
once a week over a four-week period to the driving simulator in a
huge hangar-like building in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   Each was tested once after being given the usual dose of
diphenhydramine; once with the usual dose of fexofenadine; once
with enough alcohol to produce a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1
percent, the legal limit in some states; and once with a placebo
containing no medication or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Over a simulated 45-mile course on a two-lane rural road, the
machine measured participants' ability to match speeds as a lead
vehicle speeded and slowed, their ability to stay in their lane,
and their ability to avoid a crash when a vehicle pulled out from a
driveway in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Test drivers' following ability was significantly better after
they took alcohol or fexofenadine than after diphenhydramine.
Steering instability was greater with diphenhydramine or alcohol
than fexofenadine or placebo. The number of times they crossed into
the oncoming lane was twice as great after taking diphenhydramine
as after fexofenadine or placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler also pointed out that the participants' assessments of
how drowsy they were did not correlate with their performance,
suggesting that people who take antihistamines may not be able to
judge when they are impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The results did not surprise people who have taken over-the
counter allergy medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just zonk me out,'' Debbie Newton, a Mercerville, N.J.,
educational testing company employee. ''For each pill you have a
cup of coffee or a cup of cappuccino.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Greyhound bus crash killed seven people and injured 18
on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1998, the National Transportation
Safety Board blamed the sleepy driver's irregular work hours and
also said he was impaired by antihistamine.

<HEADLINE> Iridium Searches For New Backer  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Iridium LLC, running out of cash and would-be
saviors, is getting one more lifeline so its satellites can provide
mobile phone service for 11 more days.
</P>
<P>
   A federal bankruptcy court approved a request Monday for Iridium
to spend $3 million while searching for another potential backer
now that wireless magnate Craig McCaw has abandoned plans to invest
in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute funding, agreed to by Iridium's lenders, was
approved as Iridium used up the remainder of a $5 million cash
infusion by McCaw and Motorola, the lead investor in the Iridium
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's company, Eagle River Investments, had provided the
funding to keep Iridium afloat while appraising its interest in the
satellite company, but announced on Friday that it would not make a
bid. Afterward, Washington-based Iridium asserted that other
parties had also expressed an interest in making a bid.
</P>
<P>
   On a far less hopeful note, however, the court also approved a
motion authorizing the sale of the furniture, fixtures and
equipment at Iridium's headquarters in Washington, valued at about
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which owns 18 percent of Iridium, has declined to
provide any more cash, but agreed to continue to operate and
maintain Iridium's constellation of 66 satellites until March 17, a
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new $3 million lifeline gives Iridium one last chance to
find new financial backing before the bankruptcy court liquidates
the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had speculated McCaw would use Iridium to build a
customer base for his two future satellite ventures. The first is
ICO Global Communications Ltd., a would-be Iridium rival that McCaw
has already agreed to rescue from bankruptcy. The second is
Teledesic LLC, a company he co-founded with Microsoft Corp.'s
billionaire chairman Bill Gates to build a satellite-based
''Internet in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement issued Friday, Eagle River said it has
determined that Iridium wouldn't make such a good fit with the
other ventures after all. The statement emphasized that Iridium's
satellites were designed primarily for voice service, while the
networks envisioned for ICO and Teledesic would place greater
emphasis on high-speed transmission of Internet traffic and other
data.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium filed for bankruptcy court protection last August,
unable to make payments on debts totaling about $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the company had about 50,000 subscribers, more
than triple its customer count last summer, but still well shy of
the levels needed to stay afloat without new infusions of cash from
outside. Complicating matters, Iridium is now competing for
subscribers with Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd., a satellite
venture that launched service in the United States and Canada
earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> No.1 Conn 79, No.5 Notre Dame 54  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Tamika Williams had 16 points and anchored
a dominating post game as No. 1 Connecticut beat Boston College
79-54 on Monday in the semifinals of the Big East tournament.
</P>
<P>
   UConn (29-1) will play either Notre Dame or Rutgers for the
title Tuesday. The defending champion Huskies have won the last six
tournament titles.
</P>
<P>
   It was BC's first appearance in the semifinals since 1990. The
No. 5 Eagles have not been to a final since 1987 when they lost to
Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   Williams got most of her inside feeds from Svetlana Abrosimova,
who finished with a career-high 10 assists. The Huskies outscored
Boston College 50-18 in the paint using a deep and talented bench
to wear down the Eagles (25-8). UConn reserves accounted for 39
points.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's defense pressured BC into 16 first half turnovers, and
on the offensive end, the Huskies went inside to Williams early and
often.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn up 6-4, the power forward scored eight of the next 14
points. Shea Ralph and Asjha Jones combined for six in the 14-0 run
to give UConn its biggest lead of the half, 20-4 with 12:48
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Five straight BC turnovers kept the Eagles scoreless for nearly
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' inside game began to heat up midway through the
half, and the spark was sophomore forward Becky Gottstein, who
finished with 19 points. She hit three of BC's last four field
goals and the Eagles trailed 34-23 at the break, but would get no
closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies continued the pressure in the post to start the
second half got the same results. They opened with a 12-4 on five
inside baskets and a pair of free throws to go up 46-27 with 13:52
left. UConn led by as much as 32 in the period.
</P>
<P>
   UConn capitalized with 31 points on 25 BC turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Gottstein was playing in her third straight game since returning
from a right ankle stress fracture that sidelined her for six
weeks. Before the injury she led the conference with 10 rebounds a
game and was the second leading scorer on the team. She got five
boards in the first half, but was held to a pair in the second.
</P>
<P>
   UConn outrebounded the Eagles 39-31. Abrosimova and Kelly
Schumacher had six apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Alissa Murphy had 13 points for the Eagles.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir 990 Victims Identified  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The remains of the first victims of
EgyptAir Flight 990 have been identified, four months after the
plane plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Medical, dental and fingerprint records were used to determine
the identities of the 14 victims -- all U.S. residents -- paving the
way for families to bury their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct. 31 off the Massachusetts island
of Nantucket, killing the 217 people on board. A salvage ship
worked for a week in December, raising the wreckage and remains off
the ocean floor.

   The Rhode Island medical examiner's office has been overseeing
the identification process. It has been working with 6,000 tissue
fragments and a smaller number of body parts. Only 1,300 fragments
are suitable for DNA testing, and results may not be ready for 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service was held in November in Newport for all the
relatives and many already held private funerals.

<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board estimated that 70
percent of the aircraft, including one engine, and sections of the
wings, tail and body, was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NTSB Chairman James Hall said the second engine would
be raised. A civilian ship with an underwater robot is scheduled to
begin the task March 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a good job on videotaping and taking pictures
underwater, but it can also help if we have it out of the water to
get a closer look at it,'' NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit
voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said
in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could
have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has disputed reports that investigators are increasingly
convinced the jet was crashed deliberately, saying his agency must
conduct more studies before they settle on a cause.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Clears Way for Execution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled Monday
that a convicted child murderer and rapist is mentally competent,
clearing the way for him to become the first person executed in the
state since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glen Coe, 43, is scheduled to die March 23. His attorneys
had argued that Tennessee's process for determining mental
competency was flawed and did not give them enough time to prove
his incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five Supreme Court justices found that Coe has some
type of mental disorder but understands his impending execution and
the reason for it. He was convicted of the 1979 murder of an
8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Coe cursed and spit during his competency hearing, leading a
judge to have him gagged. The justices pointed out that comments he
made in his outburst were ''logical, coherent and responsive to the
happenings in the courtroom'' and stopped once he was removed.
</P>
<P>
   The mental competency issue was Coe's last gasp in the state
court system. He can appeal to the federal courts to review the
state's process for determining his competency, and will likely do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Coe also can appeal to Gov. Don Sundquist for clemency.

<HEADLINE> Three Golfers Added To Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Paul Azinger and Shigeki Maruyama held their
positions in the top 50 in the world golf ranking Monday, earning
invitations to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger, who withdrew from the Doral-Ryder Open because of a
sore elbow, dropped one spot to No. 49, while Maruyama moved up a
position to No. 48 based on his tie for fourth at Doral.
</P>
<P>
   The only other player not previously eligible who got into the
Masters on Monday was Kirk Triplett, who won the Nissan Open in Los
Angeles three weeks ago. That not only got him into the top 50, but
he is third on the PGA Tour money list.
</P>
<P>
   Under new qualifications effective this year, the Augusta
National no longer invites winners of PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the field comes from the top 50 in the world
rankings and the top 40 from the money list. The Masters also takes
those in the top 50 in the rankings, as well as the top three from
the 2000 money list, at the end of the Doral-Ryder Open.
</P>
<P>
   The only other way a player can get to Augusta now is to win The
Players Championship in three weeks, which carries a three-year
exemption to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The club also can invite an international player of its
discretion, and is believed to be considering Michael Campbell of
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters will be played April 6-9.

<HEADLINE> Classes Resume After Mich. Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By A.J. DICKERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Greeted by teddy bears and
extra security, Buell Elementary School children returned to class
Monday for the first time since a first-grader was shot to death in
her classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Children and parents alike expressed fears at first about
returning to the school where 6-year-old Kayla Rolland was killed
Feb. 29, allegedly by another first-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was afraid it was going to be him next,'' Lisa Davidson
said of her second-grade son, Tim.
</P>
<P>
   Room 6, where the shooting occurred, had been cleaned and
repainted. Trauma counselors with teddy bears were in each room to
help the children, and by the lunch break, some children were
skipping on the sidewalk out front.
</P>
<P>
   Plainclothes and uniformed police officers were inside and
outside the school. School Superintendent Ira Rutherford said
officials wanted to increase security without having too strong a
police presence and scaring the children.
</P>
<P>
   About 335, or 79 percent, of the 424 children enrolled at Buell
were in school Monday, according to Rutherford's office. Average
attendance figures for other days were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old boy accused of killing Kayla wasn't at Buell, or
any other school, on Monday, and officials are determining his next
step, Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Morrish said he had considered not sending his son Ryan to
kindergarten Monday. But when the morning session was over, Ryan
came out carrying a brown bear and a drawing he had colored of a
green bear.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it was fine. They played outside,'' Morrish said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Michigan flags remained at half-staff, and a nearby
evergreen tree with stuffed animals at its base was decorated with
pink ribbons in memory of Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw laughter. I saw lots of hugs. It was a smooth opening,''
said Susan Stuber, a spokeswoman for a neighboring school district
helping out in Mount Morris Township.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, several hundred people attended a memorial
service at Greater Friendship Azusa Church of God in Christ, across
the street from the school.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipers then crossed the street bearing candles and sang
''This Little Light of Mine'' around a tree decorated with pink
ribbons in Kayla's memory.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continued, the police chief said that
investigators believe the boy accused of killing Kayla talked to
his 8-year-old brother on the way to school that day about the gun
he had found.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe no one else knew,'' Police Chief Eric King said,
adding that it is not clear if the older brother actually saw the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told police that Kayla had slapped him on the arm the
day before the shooting. That night, King said, the boy decided to
take the gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he did it to scare her,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges are expected against the boy, who authorities have
said is too young to understand what happened. A 19-year-old man
living at the house where the boy had been staying has been charged
with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly leaving the gun around.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has been placed, along with his brother and sister, in
the custody of an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Simons, who is circulating a petition to place metal
detectors, security cameras and more teacher's aides in the school,
said she plans to home-school her 8-year-old son until she is
convinced the school is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I send my kid to school, how do I know it's not going to
happen again?'' Simons said. ''He's scared that if he sticks up for
himself that he's going to get hurt, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said going back to school is an important part of
dealing with the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as we can get back in a routine, the healing can
begin,'' said Bill Pfohl, a counselor with the National
Organization for Victim Assistance. ''This community has done a
very good job of reaching out and helping each other.''

<HEADLINE> DA Makes Deal With BCCI Defendant  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Manhattan district attorney's office said
Monday it has made a deal with a British lawyer whose two trials in
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International case ended in
deadlocked juries.
</P>
<P>
   David Sandy, a solicitor in the London firm of Simmons &AMP;
Simmons, was charged in April 1995 with tampering with evidence for
allegedly hiding the computer disk diaries of Zafar Iqbal, BCCI's
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which once had branches in more than 70 countries, in
effect ran a giant Ponzi scheme in which money was moved from one
place to another as needed while its operators extracted as much as
they could.
</P>
<P>
   When BCCI was forced to close in 1991, depositors lost some $10
billion in what prosecutors called the biggest bank swindle in
history. Before its collapse the bank was run by a ruling family of
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's last trial ended Dec. 14 when the jury, after four days
of deliberations, failed to reach a verdict. The agreement with the
district attorney's office means there will not be a third trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's lawyer, John Wing, denied that his client committed the
crimes with which he is charged, but ''decided that this resolution
was the best way to conclude the matter in order to avoid the
substantial additional expenses of yet a third two-month trial far
from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Wing said the diary notes were so inconsequential that
prosecutors held them for five years without using them in any
prosecution except Sandy's.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said Sandy is the only lawyer ever prosecuted in Manhattan
for withholding evidence. He added that the Justice Department,
viewing the same evidence, had declined top prosecute his client.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for Sandy, probably the last BCCI defendant,
to refrain from practicing law or working in any capacity for, or
receiving any income or direct or indirect benefit from any law
firm for the next 18 months, through Sept. 2, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy, 44, also agreed that after the ban on his legal work
lapses, he will, from Sept. 3 through Dec. 31, 2001, limit his
client contact and legal work and restrict his activities at any
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement's terms, approved by State Supreme Court Justice
John Cataldo, also require Sandy and his law firm to provide
written confirmations of his compliance with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If Sandy complies with the agreement's terms, the district
attorney's office will move next March 3 to dismiss the indictment.
The court will retain jurisdiction over Sandy until March 3, 2002,
the agreement says.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Carnival Fever Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, (AP) -- It's CARNIVAL in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of revelers flooded streets in cities
across the country Monday, the second day of Brazil's yearly
pre-lenten celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight was Rio's parade, which continues non-stop until
Tuesday morning. But that event wasn't without it notable
sidelights.
</P>
<P>
   TV actress Angela Bismarck covered herself in Brazil's national
colors and nothing else, almost getting arrested for insulting the
country's flag.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were preparing to arrest the nude actress as
she danced atop a float, but held off when she donned clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an homage to Brazil and its flag, which are very
special now that the country is commemorating 500 years of its
discovery,'' she said. Speaking on television, she also said that
she was ready to parade again ''more or less the same way''.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Brazil's newspapers offered evidence of the offense,
carrying photographs of Bismarck's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Public nudity has become so accepted -- some of Rio's biggest
public beaches have begun to go topless -- that even spectators at
the carnival parades have begun to strip.
</P>
<P>
   Nine topless models took over a booth at rio Sambodrome to cheer
samba groups in the parade, while others wearing tiny bikinis
danced on top of colorfully adorned samba schools cars.
</P>
<P>
   The annual celebration is actually a hard fought competition
where 14 of the best samba groups fight it out for the honor of
being judged champion.
</P>
<P>
   This year's carnival, which coincides with the 500th anniversary
of Brazil's discovery by Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral
on April 22, 1500, has drawn an outpouring of national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools made the event the main feature of their allegoric
cars, showing Indians in chains and others wearing native costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Others depicted the saga of slaves from Africa, and some
ridiculed military dictators who ruled the country between 1964 and
1985. The parades kicked off Sunday night and last through Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   According to most estimates, this year's Carnival is the party
with most participants ever. Embratur, the country's tourism
agency, estimated that revenue during the four-day holiday will
represent up to $1.2 billion for the nation's coffers.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Kills Fish in Rio Lagoon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A leaking sewer line pumped
contaminated waste from homes and businesses into a popular Rio
lagoon, killing more than 30 tons of fish, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible smell arising from the rotting fish drove people
away from the park around the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. People
usually flock to the lagoon to escape the central city, strolling
the waterside and stopping at cafes for snacks and refreshments.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, it was deserted except for a few people, mostly
park attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The fish began dying on Sunday because of a leak in the sewer
system that passes along the bottom of the lagoon on its way to the
sea, said Mario Moscatelli, a biologist and the lagoon's natural
resources manager.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system carries waste from homes and businesses far
out into the ocean and deposits them. But it began pumping the
waste through a leak in the lagoon when the system became
overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental workers and fishermen working since early Sunday
said as much as 30 tons of dead fish had washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents shut their windows and cars sped through to get
out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''The smell was insufferable,'' said Alexandre Simoes, an
engineer who lives in an apartment building close to the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jair Otero, director of the Urban Cleaning Operations unit, said
an early signal of the disaster came in December. ''Four tons of
dead fish were found at that time. It was a clear signal of an
upcoming disaster but political interference prevented a quick
action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon gets its water mainly from the sea, via a mile-long
canal. It is also fed by a few small rivers.

<HEADLINE> Bush Tries To Rebound on 'Tonight'  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Less than a week after he bombed with
David Letterman, George W. Bush sought a comedic rebound Monday on
''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   The late-night talk show opened with a skit making fun of the
Texas governor's poor performance on a pop quiz earlier in his
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Leno was filmed walking through the hallways of the NBC studios
outside Los Angeles, anxiously looking for Bush, who was in his
dressing room reviewing the names of foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is Tony Blair,'' said Bush. ''Who is Boris Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno, feigning surprise, acted incredulous as the governor
appeared not to know the names of the British prime minister and
Russia's former president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, feigning indignation himself, said he was conducting a
daily briefing with one of his advisers. At that point, the camera
panned back to show Bush speaking with ''Jeopardy'' host Alex
Trebek.
</P>
<P>
   ''all right governor, once again the category is foreign
leaders. Who was the prime minister of Israel from 1996 to 1999?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ''Who is Benjamin ?''
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled with the correct answer, Leno pumped a fist and said,
''Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance last Wednesday on CBS' ''The Late Show With
David Letterman'' was hampered by a delay in the satellite
connection between Letterman's studio in New York and St. Louis,
where Bush taped the segment.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's jokes fell flat, but his staff said the show
rated well with a focus group that watched it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance with Leno was sandwiched between campaign
stops in Los Angeles and Long Beach. It was negotiated by Joe
Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager, and Mark McKinnon, his media
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Leno's staff sought unusual tidbits about Bush, and the staff
replied with stories about a childhood job at Sears and his
ownership of the Texas Rangers baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to show his personality, with stories that people
hadn't heard before,'' said Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Another target of Leno's humor were members of Bush's security
detail.
</P>
<P>
   With cameras showing team leader Mike Escalante and the rest of
the stone-faced crew, Leno said: ''You know they drop that whole
thing when they're in the bar. 'Yeah, I work with Governor Bush.'
There is nothing in their ear. They just do that to impress
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno also was relentless against Bill Bradley, whose hopes for
winning the Democratic presidential nomination were fading.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian joked that Bradley had been pulled over by the
police and charged with ''driving under the influence of thinking
he can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno, noting Tuesday's multistate primary sweepstakes, also
said: ''As you know, tomorrow is 'Super Tuesday,' or as Bill
Bradley calls it, 'Tuesday.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Leno have an unusual connection. Leno grew up north of
Boston in Andover, Mass., the same town where Bush attended prep
school at Phillips Academy.

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos continued their defensive
makeover Monday by signing cornerback Jimmy Spencer. Terms of the
contract were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, 30, had four interceptions and 49 tackles last season
for the San Diego Chargers. Spencer, a former eighth-round draft
pick, has also played for the New Orleans Saints and Cincinnati
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer is Denver's fifth addition on defense in the past three
weeks, and the third to the secondary in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darryl Pounds reached a contract agreement Friday,
and the Broncos signed safety Billy Jenkins on Thursday after
acquiring him in a trade with the St. Louis Rams.
</P>

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Iona's Tariq Kirksay was carried off the
court on a board to stabilize his back after going down hard in the
first half of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Tournament

   Iona officials said the MAAC player of the year wasn't seriously

He was taken out of the game as a precautionary measure with

the drive and went down along with Siena's Dwayne Archbold. The
Saints were ahead 24-22 at the time.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Boundary Control Tightened  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers stepped up efforts
Monday to control Kosovo's borders, hoping to stop the flow of
weapons and guerrillas believed to be fueling tensions in the
volatile region just inside Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes amid increasing hostility near the town of
Dobrosin, a predominantly ethnic Albanian village in southern
Serbia. That area has been the site of sporadic clashes between
ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serb police, and there are fears of
renewed fighting similar to the conflict in Kosovo last year, which
led to NATO attacks against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of refugees have fled the area in the recent months,
streaming into the closest Kosovo town of Gnjilane, about 30 miles
southeast of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, the NATO commander in Kosovo Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt said movement across the boundary, formerly with little
restriction, would be controlled. ''We have readjusted our forces
to get more forces available for border security and we'll watch
everybody going in and out of that area,'' he told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot support any adventurism which might lead to new
atrocities in the Presevo Valley,'' he said referring to Dobrosin
region. He said several people bearing weapons trying to cross had
recently been arrested, but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects NATO's increasing concern about a newly formed
rebel group composed of fighters who say they are trying to protect
villagers in the region from attacks by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac,
it is named after three predominantly ethnic Albanian towns just
outside Kosovo in southern Serbia where villagers say they have
been subjected to harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not allow Kosovo to become some sort of perceived safe
haven for groups of armed extremists where they feel they can mount
attacks on southern Serbia with impunity,'' said Warrant Officer
Mark Cox, a NATO spokesman in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion of border controls came the same day that the
U.N. Security Council was to debate the situation in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's representative to the United Nations in Geneva
renewed criticism of Kosovo administrator Bernard Kouchner,
accusing his administration of serving U.S. interests in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, his U.N. administration and the NATO-led peacekeeping
force ''are directly responsible'' for a deteriorating situation in
Kosovo marked by violence against Serbs and other minority groups,
Ambassador Branko Brankovic said. The Dobrosin region borders the
part of Kosovo controlled by U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner urged the Security Council to more clearly define its
political objectives in Kosovo, saying the status quo can't last.
He proposed the creation of an intermediate constitution be adopted
to guide the administration of Kosovo. Afterwards, he told
journalists that there was an ''absolute consensus'' among council
members to hold local elections by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions call for ''substantial autonomy'' for Kosovo,
but Kouchner urged council members to define what shape that would

</P>
<P>
   Gen. Reinhardt echoed his concern, stressing that the ambiguity
over Kosovo's future exacerbates ethnic tensions. From a security
standpoint, Reinhardt said the current situation poses an
unacceptable level of risk to NATO soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of police and a fully functioning court system has
created a ''climate of impunity'' that has a direct affect on the
most pressing security issue in Kosovo: protecting ethnic
minorities from attacks by the ethnic Albanian majority, Reinhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the session, the Yugoslavs circulated a 16-page
memorandum to members that included the accusation that members of
the former Kosovo Liberation Army were running labor camps in the
Pristina suburb of Maticane and the town of Dusanovo, just outside
of the southern Kosovo city of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said that the purported camps contain ''several hundred
abducted Serbian civilians'' who have been ''subjected to extremely
cruel and inhuman treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeepers dismissed the report it as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no camps whatsoever,'' A NATO spokesman, Lt. Cmdr.
Philip Anido, said in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers were still searching, meanwhile, for a 15-year-old
wanted in the slaying of a Russian peacekeeper. The teen slipped
away from French military custody Sunday after he climbed out a
bathroom window.

<HEADLINE> UN Rights Chief Pushes for Chechens  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. human rights chief said Monday
she will use her upcoming trip to Chechnya to push for the rights
of its people to seek redress from Russia, whose soldiers are
accused of widespread rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson said she would also press for investigations for
''those in uniform who on behalf of the state'' are alleged to have
committed atrocities, including torching homes and villages, raping
women and torturing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said she
planned to travel to the region in the first days of April -- enough
time to report back to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, which
begins its six-week session in Geneva on March 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have concerns but I also know it's important to be
open-minded and fair, and I will assess the situation to the best
of my ability,'' Robinson told reporters after meeting with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ''My real concern is not only to be a voice for the victims of
human rights violations and abuses, but also to make a very strong
case for the need for redress -- the need for fair procedures for
those who allege that their rights have been seriously violated,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she was pleased that Moscow had invited her to
visit after her initial requests were denied.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized Robinson for what it
called her ''nonobjective, biased and one-sided'' criticism of the
Chechen war. Russia has denied allegations of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov invited Robinson last
week to visit Moscow and the North Caucasus in early April.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and other international officials have protested the
large number of civilian casualties, and have called for
independent investigations into alleged torture and other abuses in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, four U.N. human rights experts urged Russia to
investigate allegations of arbitrary detention, summary executions,
torture and violence against women in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   They called on the Russian government ''to provide information
regarding the reports of abuses,'' including its troops' alleged
killing and rape of civilians during raids and searches of Chechen
villages, and forced displacement of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In her comments to reporters, Robinson also repeated that the
human rights situation in China, where she has just visited, had
deteriorated in some key areas with the crackdown on the Falun Gong
movement.
</P>
<P>
   And commenting on the case of Chilean Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
Robinson praised as ''very important'' the legal precedent set by
Britain's House of Lords to allow him to be extradited to face
prosecution for rights violations. Despite the ruling, Britain
allowed Pinochet to return home last week rather than face trial in
Spain, ruling he was mentally and physically unfit.

<HEADLINE> Maersk CEO says he's ''frustrated'' with PA stalemate  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The head of one of the world's largest
shipping companies said Monday he was ''frustrated'' by a Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey stalemate that has kept his
lease to stay at the port in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Thomsen, chairman and CEO of Maersk Inc., said the company
may eventually rethink its options if the agency fails to sign off
quickly on the lease. He wouldn't say how long the delay would have
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating to be kept waiting as the largest customer,''
in the New York-New Jersey port, Thomsen said Monday. ''If we were
to treat our major customers the same way we were treated in this
process, I don't think we would have been in business for long.''
</P>
<P>
   Maersk, which merged last year with Sea-Land Service, handles up
to 25 percent of the cargo that flows in and out of the port each
year. In a much-publicized decision last year, the two companies
decided to renew their lease and continue to keep New York-New
Jersey its hub port, bypassing lucrative offers from ports like
Baltimore and Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   The companies decided to stay at the port in May, but the Port
Authority's commissioners have failed at its monthly meetings to
approve the lease, along with billions of dollars in other new
business.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of New York and New Jersey each control half of
the commissioners' votes, and have kept the commissioners from
jointly approving projects while they fight about how the authority
has allocated money between the two states.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman on Monday urged New York Gov. George
Pataki to allow his commissioners to approve the Maersk lease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's move ahead. We don't have to hold things hostage,'' she
said. ''I am willing to spend money on the New York side of the
river, but we need to make sure that Sealand Maersk goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Thomsen's remarks, she said, ''I can understand his
frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Pataki have recently exchanged letters, the last
coming from Whitman on Thursday with a request for a face-to-face
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Charles Deister said Monday that Pataki is
considering Whitman's request, and referred all other comments on
the Port Authority to the board's vice president, Pataki appointee
Charles Gargano.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agree with the concern of Mr. Thomsen, and his
frustration,'' Gargano said. ''That's all the more reason why we
have to get to the bottom of this and resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said that the authority, which operates the region's
three airports, shipping piers, six interstate bridges and tunnels,
commuter bus and train lines and the World Trade Center, has
unfairly allocated money for years to projects that benefit New
Jersey more than New York.
</P>
<P>
   He objected in a letter to Whitman to a subsidy that New York
would have to provide in order for the Maersk deal to go through.
Whitman has denied such a subsidy exists.
</P>
<P>
   Thomsen said he didn't blame one governor more than the other
for the stalemate. He said the lack of lease approval, including
the failure to move ahead on a new $200 million terminal, is
affecting other shippers at piers in Newark and Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now need to go on and execute our plans,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Illegal Immigrants Die in Storm  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Three illegal immigrants died after
being caught in a winter storm in the mountains east of San Diego
and dozens of others were rescued Monday from the cold.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the three men were pulled Monday from the
snow-frosted mountains of the Cleveland National Forest, a busy
corridor for illegal immigration from Mexico. Asked to identify one
body, a young man in jeans and a cotton jacket was escorted from a
Border Patrol truck and nodded ''yes'' to acknowledge that the
victim had been part of his group of border-crossers.
</P>
<P>
   Sick and cold illegal immigrants stumbled out of the Laguna
Mountains all day Monday after a weekend storm dumped 6 to 8 inches
of snow. Temperatures Sunday night plunged to lows of between 20
and 34 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities began searching after five men and four women found
Monday morning reported that at least three other immigrants had
remained in the mountains, Border Patrol spokesman Gloria Chavez
said. The search was called off at 4 p.m. after those known to be
missing were accounted for, Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather is still bad, so we could still go back out,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty people as of Monday afternoon had been rescued and taken
to hospitals for treatment or evaluated while in the custody of
immigration authorities. One woman found near Coral Canyon was
rushed by helicopter to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   With the three deaths, a total of 16 immigrants in California
have died this year while illegally entering the United States
along the state's 140-mile border with Mexico, according to Claudia
Smith, executive director of the California Rural Legal Assistance
Foundation, an immigrant rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Smith blames the deaths on Operation Gatekeeper, a U.S. border
crackdown that began in 1995 and pushed illegal immigration away
from San Diego and east into the mountains and deserts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a strategy that is going to keep killing people
regardless of search and rescue efforts,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   At midday Monday, 15 illegal immigrants wearing light clothing
winced with pain and limped badly as they were loaded into a Border
Patrol vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one-year-old Joaquin Lopez Ramirez of the central Mexican
state of Queretaro said he'd been traveling for four days. He was
among 20 men who had left the border city of Tijuana with
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had happened, he shrugged and said: ''They left us.''
</P>
<P>
   More precipitation was forecast Monday night and Tuesday, and
snow could fall at elevations as low as 4,000 feet.

   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Riot police fired tear gas and
rubber bullets at a group of doctors and Social Security workers
who blocked a street Monday to protest the plans to sell
government-owned clinics and hospitals to private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 medical employees closed off a street and prevented
some ambulances from getting through to the city's medical center
to protest President Francisco Flores' anticipated privatization of
medical services.
</P>
<P>
   In a confrontation that lasted more than an hour, riot police
dispersed the strikers. At least 10 people were treated by aid
workers, but none were reported seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of strikers blocked two streets north of the
capital and the Panamerican highway in the city of Santa Tecla a
few miles west of San Salvador. No major incidents were reported.

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Drop Gravano Charges  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A judge on Monday denied a request to drop drug
charges against Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano after lawyers
argued the former mob hitman was arrested without a proper warrant
and was denied an attorney at his initial hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Larry Hammond made the arguments during a bond hearing
for Gravano, who was arrested Feb. 24 and charged with involvement
in an ecstasy-selling ring. Hammond argued that Gravano's $5
million cash bond would not have been so high had he been there
during the initial appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Ronald Reinstein dismissed the complaints
but will hold a follow-up hearing on the bond.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and 44 others, including his wife, son and daughter,
were indicted by a state grand jury Monday on charges including
conspiracy and racketeering. The charges carry maximum 12{-year
prison sentences each -- if the suspect has no prior convictions.
</P>
<P>
   He was also charged with money laundering and weapons
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond did not return a phone call seeking comment on the
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, 54, admitted killing 19 people while part of the
Gambino crime organization and testified against Mafia boss John
Gotti, who was sentenced to life in prison. Gravano served five
years and has since been living in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   He was released in 1995, given a new name through the witness
protection program and underwent plastic surgery. Gravano, also
known as Jimmy Moran, dropped out of the program by early 1997.

<HEADLINE> US West, Qwest Reach Proposed Deal  </HEADLINE>
By HUNTER T. GEORGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- To win approval of their merger, U S West
and Qwest Communications International reached a proposed
settlement with state officials that would freeze phone rates until
2004 and establish financial incentives for quality control.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Monday, which needs approval by
Washington's three-member regulatory commission, requires the
merged company to improve the state's telecommunications network
and to meet certain quality standards or else pay customers as much
as $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes a day after Qwest acknowledged talks with
Deutsche Telekom of Germany about a deal to acquire both Qwest and
U S West.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, which agreed in July to acquire U S West for stock now
worth $56 billion, issued a statement Sunday night confirming the
discussions without naming the company, which is reportedly
Germany-based Deutsche Telekom AG.
</P>
<P>
   U S West, which was kept in the dark about the negotiations,
threatened Friday to sue Qwest if the company backed out of its
contract. The fact that Qwest was discussing a deal with another
company raises questions about whether Qwest breached its agreement
with U S West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have recently been informed that Qwest has had
conversations with a major telecommunications company,'' U S West
General Counsel Mark Roellig said in a statement Sunday night. ''As
we indicated last week, these conversations were conducted without
our approval and we do not have any knowledge of the status or
substance of the conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom would not comment Monday on the developments
between Qwest and U S West, nor on whether it was in talks with
Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, chief executive Ron Sommer said in an
interview with Germany's Die Welt newspaper that his company is
planning a takeover soon and isn't ruling out a big acquisition. He
also reiterated that the U.S. market is very important for Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's statement Sunday said Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz, Qwest's principal shareholder, would support transactions
with the major telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Chairman Joseph Nacchio has been quoted in recent
newspaper stories saying the deal with U S West might not be
completed. He has also expressed concern about U S West's conflicts
with regulators in some of its 14-state territory, including
Colorado where it was ordered to refund $12.77 million to phone
customers for service-quality violations.
</P>
<P>
   U S West has said it will fight the order.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio, though, said Sunday that the merger agreement with U S
West is still in place and Qwest will not enter into any
transaction with the other company ''unless U S West reaches an
agreement with that company for the acquisition of U S West on
terms acceptable to it.''
</P>
<P>
   U S West remains committed to completing the merger with Qwest,
Roellig said.
</P>
<P>
   When U S West and Qwest first announced their deal in July, they
promised to create a powerful communications company with customers
in 14 states, and an aggressive Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nacchio wanted to acquire U S West so badly that he
launched a hostile bidding war to break up a merger agreement
between U S West and Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based company
building an undersea fiber-optic cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to employees Friday, U S West chairman, Solomon
Trujillo, ''pledged to fight for the interests of employees and
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo said last week that he would resign from the company
after the merger with Qwest closed.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of U S West were down 25 cents at $74.87{ at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange, where Qwest's stock was down $4 at
$60. Deutsche Telekom's shares were up 50 cents at $99.12{.
</P>
<P>
   U S West is Washington state's largest local telephone carrier,
serving 3 million residential and business phone lines. Qwest, also
based in Denver, is the nation's fourth-largest long-distance
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings on the settlement with Washington are set for next
month around the state, after which the Washington Utilities and
Transportation Commission will consider whether to approve the
deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Less than a week after he bombed with
David Letterman, George W. Bush sought a comedic rebound Monday on
''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedian asked the Texas governor and Republican
presidential candidate about his family and his courtship of his
wife, but also made light of Bush's admitted partying past.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you were out at a frat party, having a good time at Yale
(University) partying with the boys, were you ever thinking, 'You
know, I don't want to have that beer. I might be running for
president.' Did that ever cross your mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush deadpanned: ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor gave as good as he got, though, turning around
Leno's persistent questions about whether he is a cheapskate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I'm thrifty. I'm going to be tight with your money -- all
that money you make, I'm going to be tight with,'' Bush said,
hinting at Leno's multimillion-dollar salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, you're very good at this,'' Leno replied. ''I still didn't
get an answer to the question.''
</P>
<P>
   The late-night talk show opened with a skit making fun of the
Bush's poor performance on a pop quiz earlier in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Leno was filmed walking through the hallways of the NBC studios
outside Los Angeles, anxiously looking for Bush, who was in his
dressing room reviewing the names of foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is Tony Blair,'' said Bush. ''Who is Boris Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno, acting surprised, appeared incredulous as the governor
appeared not to know the names of the British prime minister and
Russia's former president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, feigning indignation himself, said he was conducting a
daily briefing with one of his advisers. At that point, the camera
panned back to show Bush speaking with ''Jeopardy'' host Alex
Trebek.
</P>
<P>
   ''All right governor, once again the category is foreign
leaders. Who was the prime minister of Israel from 1996 to 1999?''
Trebek said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ''Who is Benjamin Netanyahu?''
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled with the correct answer, Leno pumped a fist and said,
''Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance last Wednesday on CBS' ''The Late Show With
David Letterman'' was hampered by a delay in the satellite
connection between Letterman's studio in New York and St. Louis,
where Bush taped the segment. Several of the governor's jokes fell
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning all day in California, the appearance on Leno was
negotiated by top aides and sandwiched between stops in Los Angeles
and Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Another target of Leno's humor were members of Bush's security
detail.
</P>
<P>
   With cameras showing team leader Mike Escalante and the rest of
the stone-faced crew, Leno said: ''You know they drop that whole
thing when they're in the bar. 'Yeah, I work with Governor Bush.'
There is nothing in their ear. They just do that to impress
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno also poked fun at Bill Bradley, whose hopes for winning the
Democratic presidential nomination were fading. He joked that
Bradley had been pulled over by the police and charged with
''driving under the influence of thinking he can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Leno have an unusual connection. Leno grew up north of
Boston in Andover, Mass., the same town where Bush attended prep
school at Phillips Academy.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Gets Big Welcome Home  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN LIPMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Wearing a pair of sunglasses to hide a bump above
his eye Monday, solo balloonist Kevin Uliassi greeted well-wishers
three days after he was forced to abort his around-the-world
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi, 36, arrived at O'Hare International Airport from Tokyo
to the cheers of more than a dozen friends and family members,
including his parents and his wife, Renee.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time they had seen him since he lifted off Feb.
22 from a quarry outside Rockford in an attempt to become the first
solo balloonist to circle the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi landed Friday in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar,
also known as Burma, after experiencing equipment problems. He had
traveled more than 13,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   A technical problem with the oxygen system he used to breathe
prompted his decision to land in Myanmar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing beyond that, only mountains and jungle,'' he
said. ''At some point it just makes sense to terminate the
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The balloon hit an embankment when it landed, giving Uliassi a
bump above his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 19 years of flying, I've never hurt myself,'' Uliassi said,
''so I'm a little ashamed about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi, an engineer who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he has
not yet decided if he will try again.
</P>
<P>
   The balloonist said he was glad in a way that he did not make it
all the way around the world because his emergency landing let him
meet people he otherwise would have just flown over.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were 400 villagers who adopted me, and a whole hospital
full of doctors and nurses,'' he said. ''If you complete the
flight, that landing's not nearly as interesting. I'd just be
landing in Rockford or Illinois and people would just be like, 'Oh,
well great.' I wouldn't have any stories.''

<HEADLINE> Court Declines Fuel Disposal Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court stayed out of a dispute
Monday between electric utilities and the federal Energy Department
over delays in building a permanent disposal site for spent nuclear
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned down the utilities' argument
that a federal appeals court should have heard their request for an
order that DOE provide storage for their spent fuel and pay the
cost of delays.
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 federal law, the National Waste Policy Act, required
utilities to reach contracts with the federal government in which
the government would begin handling disposal of spent nuclear fuel
by Jan. 31, 1998. However, by 1993 it became clear that the
government would not have a permanent or interim storage facility
ready by then.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed permanent facility at Yucca Mountain, Nev., 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas, is still under scientific review and is
scheduled to be opened in 2010 if found to be technically suitable.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to decide whether to
give it a license in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   A number of utilities went to court before 1998, seeking an
order requiring the government to begin nuclear disposal services
on Jan. 31, 1998. If it did not, utilities sought court permission
to put in escrow certain fees they were required to pay to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia refused to order the government to take the spent nuclear
fuel and said the utilities could seek financial remedies under
their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities, led by Consolidated Edison of New York, filed a
new action in July 1998 asking the appeals court to order the
government to take the nuclear fuel and pay all costs of delays
plus damages for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court dismissed the court action, saying those
issues were decided in the 1997 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal denied Supreme Court review Monday, the utilities'
lawyers said the appeals court ruling denied them court review of
the government's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said the National Waste Policy Act
did not give the federal appeals court the authority to hear
''every challenge to DOE's implementation of the nuclear waste
program.'' The utilities' proper remedy would be a
breach-of-contract claim, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Consolidated Edison Co. of New York vs. Department
of Energy, 99-766.

<HEADLINE> Mob hitman, 44 others hit with 201-count indictment  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Former Mafia hitman Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull''
Gravano and 44 others were indicted Monday on state charges of
operating an ecstasy ring.
</P>
<P>
   The 201-count indictment filed by Arizona Attorney General Janet
Napolitano included a host of charges ranging from conspiracy and
racketeering to money laundering and weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's wife, Debra, his son, Gerard, and daughter, Karen,
also were named in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy and racketeering are Class 2 felonies carrying
maximum 12{-year prison sentences each -- if the suspect has no
prior convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and 35 others were arrested Feb. 24 following a
months-long investigation into a syndicate thought to be
controlling the Maricopa County market for ecstasy, a drug popular
in the rave culture. Authorities said the ring was a
$500,000-a-week operation.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, who admitted murdering 19 people while part of the
Gambino crime organization, testified against its boss, John Gotti.
Gotti was sentenced to life in prison. Gravano served five years.
</P>
<P>
   He was released in 1995, given a new name through the witness
protection program and underwent plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, also known as Jimmy Moran, dropped out of the program
by early 1997 and had since been living what appeared to be a clean
life in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Superior Court Judge Ronald Reinstein denied a
request to drop the charges against Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Larry Hammond told the judge that Gravano was arrested
without a warrant and was denied legal counsel during an initial
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Reinstein dismissed the complaints and said it is common to
attend an initial appearance without a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond also argued that Gravano's $5 million cash bond would
not have been so high had he been there during the initial
appearance. Hammond did not return a phone call by The Associated
Press seeking comment on the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am certain this man is not a flight risk,'' Hammond said in
open court. ''In fact, I can think of no one less likely to flee
than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond will present evidence to reduce Gravano's bond during a
hearing yet to be set, said court spokeswoman Karen Arra.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for another alleged ringleader, Michael J. Papa, and for
Gerard Gravano alleged similar civil rights violations Monday,
saying their rights were violated when they repeatedly were denied
their requests for a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Reinstein also dismissed those motions, citing no record of
either requesting a lawyer during their initial appearances.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing to reduce bond for Papa and Gerard Gravano is
scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, 54, sat in court silently on Monday. His wife and
daughter also attended the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas: Lebanon Vote a Defeat  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas on Monday described
a unanimous vote by the Israeli Cabinet to withdraw from southern
Lebanon by July as a historic defeat for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet voted Sunday to withdraw its soldiers from
the Lebanese zone they have occupied for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Lebanon have both said they prefer the withdrawal to
come within the framework of a regional settlement involving Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon. But that appeared to matter
little to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision taken by the enemy's Cabinet to withdraw is the
clearest official admission'' of defeat, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
said in a statement. Its resistance operations, it said, forced
Israel to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says it occupies south Lebanon as a buffer against
Lebanese guerrilla strikes on its northern territory. But it has
been exhausted by nagging Hezbollah attacks. The low-level violence
persisted Monday as Israel launched missile attacks on Lebanese
targets in response to guerrilla assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Syria sent mixed signals. A government newspaper said Israel's
decision to withdraw is meant to cause trouble in the region. Syria
wants Israel out of the occupied zone but does not want it to
withdraw unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   However, leaders of the ruling coalition heralded it as ''a
victory for the will of the heroic Lebanese resistance'' and added
that Syrians ''would be very happy that southern Lebanon is
liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House expressed hope that Israel's
decision would lead to a resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, we believe that the needs of all the parties are best
addressed through negotiations,'' said national security spokesman
Mike Hammer. ''We will continue our efforts to help the parties
restart talks.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of its 120,000 residents, the Israeli withdrawal would
mean freedom of movement in the occupied zone -- 440 square miles
stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon on the Syrian border
in the east to the Mediterranean coast in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Wahib Mesallat, 22-year-old Shiite Muslim vegetable wholesaler,
believes peace would bring prosperity, especially if border points
linking the region and Israel remained open. But if there is
withdrawal without agreement, he said, ''there will be economic
collapse, war and revenge attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian-Israel talks broke off over a Syrian demand that
Israel agree in advance to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights,
the strategic plateau seized in a 1967 war. Israel refused, saying
it first wanted to know the extent of peace and security
arrangements Syria was prepared to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The firm deadline for withdrawal could deny Syria what Israel
has said is a major tool in peace negotiations. Israel says Syria
has used the low-level war between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli
forces to pressure Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said it would continue to retaliate for any Israeli
attacks against Lebanon, but did not elaborate. Hezbollah leaders
have said the group will turn to political activity after Israel's
occupation ends, but have not said whether the guerrillas will
disarm.

<HEADLINE> 3 Cops Convicted in Louima Coverup  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid heightened tension between the police and
the black community, three white officers were convicted Monday of
a cover-up in the attack on a Haitian immigrant brutalized with a
broken broomstick in a stationhouse bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty verdicts in one of New York City's most notorious
cases of police brutality came 10 days after four white officers
were cleared in the shooting of West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo, an unarmed black man who died a barrage of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's verdict, former patrolman Charles Schwarz, 34, and
officers Thomas Wiese, 36, and Thomas Bruder, 33, were found guilty
of lying to investigators to conceal Schwarz's role in the 1997
attack on Abner Louima, who suffered severe internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only are we now getting convictions of police on
misconduct, but actually for the conspiracy. This is a real blow to
the blue wall of silence,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Louima cousin and family spokesman Samuel Nicolas said: ''This
is not a happy occasion for us. We are not opening champagne
bottles.'' But he added, ''Now we can start the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers' convictions carry up to five years in prison. No
sentencing date was set.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz also could get life in prison when he is sentenced for
his 1999 conviction on charges of holding down a handcuffed Louima
as fellow Officer Justin Volpe sodomized him with a broken broom
handle.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest trial, prosecutors sought to show that the three
officers hid behind a ''blue wall of silence'' within the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The verdict today should send a message within the police
department that there is no greater betrayal of the badge than to
ensnare a fellow officer in a web of lies and deceit,'' U.S.
Attorney Loretta Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty verdicts triggered an outburst from the three
defendants and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz cursed loudly as he was led from the courtroom. Wiese
and Bruder, free on $100,000 bail, wept, and Wiese cradled his
mother after she collapsed in a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London, suggested the Diallo verdict and
the protests that followed may have put pressure on the jury of six
blacks, five whites and one Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to ignore the post-Diallo, anti-police climate that
resides in this city,'' London said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for all three men said they will appeal, and Schwarz's
lawyer said he asked that Schwarz be placed on suicide watch in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Louima was not in the courtroom for the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Abner Louima wants more than anything else is for what
happened to him to never happen to anyone else's children,'' said
Sanford Rubenstein, an attorney for the Louima family. The family
is suing the city for $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had accused the three officers of telling ''lie
after lie'' to save Schwarz. They offered phone records as evidence
that showed the officers spoke many times in the weeks after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Both Volpe and Schwarz had insisted Schwarz was never even in
the Brooklyn police station bathroom during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving a 30-year
sentence, testified at Schwarz's trial for the first time about the
attack, saying he mistakenly thought Louima had punched him during
a disturbance outside a Haitian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe testified that Wiese was present during the torture but
made no move to join the assault or try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese had told detectives shortly after the attack that he
entered the bathroom to find Volpe standing over Louima, stick in
hand, and then dragged Louima to safety by his feet.
</P>
<P>
   As in the first trial, Louima testified that he could identify
his second assailant only as the driver who took him to the police
station. Officials said it was Schwarz who drove the patrol car.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Bourque May Be Traded  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Ray Bourque was not in uniform Monday night as the
Boston Bruins closed in on a deal that would send their 39-year-old
leader to a contender for what could be his last chance at a
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said he was
unable to pry the 18-time All-Star away from his Boston
counterpart, Harry Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry just said they're going in a different direction,'' a
disappointed Clarke said before leaving the team's executive
offices in Voorhees, N.J., around 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Others reported to be in the hunt were Detroit, St. Louis,
Dallas and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   No deal was consummated before the end of the game, which Boston
lost 5-1. Forward Dave Andreychuk was also out of the lineup and
the Bruins did not not say why, leading to speculation that he
would be part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were subdued at the FleetCenter, yelling ''We want
Raymond'' after the Senators took a 1-0 first-period lead and
reprising the chant after Ottawa scored three goals in 100 seconds
in the third to go up 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans wished Bourque well with hand-lettered signs that
said, ''It won't be the same without No. 77,'' and ''It's a sad day
without Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has played for the Bruins for his entire 21-year career,
and is the team's career leader in scoring and games played.
Although he had said he would rather finish his career in Boston
than win the Stanley Cup elsewhere, he changed his mind as it
became clear the Bruins would not make the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's 395 career regular-season goals place him first among
defenseman in NHL history. He is second to Paul Coffey in career
assists for a defenseman with 1,111.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he is ninth in scoring with 1,506 points and fifth in
games played at 1,518.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque is in the last year of his contract and has not said
whether he wants to be back for another. That means this could be
his last chance to have his name on the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque reportedly said he would prefer to be traded to
Philadelphia or Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Boston forward Jason Allison, out of the lineup with a wrist
injury, said he didn't think of Bourque's departure as a sad
development, despite his long tenure with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to see it as a nice thing for him to do,'' said
Allison, whose injury helped the Bruins along the downward spiral
that led Bourque to ask out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, he'll get a chance to do something that everybody
who plays the game wants to do,'' Allison said. ''He's certainly
earned it more than anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Repeats Imbalance Worries  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Monday that if the high-flying stock market loses some of its zip,
that will help slow the supercharged U.S. economy to a more
sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   But in echoes of warnings he gave Congress last month, Greenspan
served noticed that the central bank would help that process along
with more interest rate increases if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks to an audience of hundreds -- who sang ''Happy
Birthday, Mr. Chairman'' to the man who turned 74 on Monday --
helped to send blue-chip stocks plunging on Wall Street. The Dow
Jones industrial average, after gaining 505 points last week, fell
197.70 points on Monday to close at 10,170.50.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said it was significant that Greenspan chose a
conference on the ''New Economy'' at Boston College to elaborate on
concerns that America's record-breaking economic expansion could be
ended by a resurgence of inflation unless growth slowed to a more
sustainable level.
</P>
<P>
   He said red-hot consumer demand, which has been met increasingly
by imported goods, had driven the nation's trade deficit to
unsustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years
raised the prospect that workers will begin to demand much higher
pay. Such demands ''would intensify inflationary pressures or
squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our
growing prosperity to an end,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Private economists viewed Greenspan's remarks as a clear signal
that the central bank, which has already boosted interest rates
four times since last June, is prepared to do more. The central
bank has pushed the federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, up a full percentage point to 5.75 percent. That
in turn has lifted commercial banks' prime lending rate, the
benchmark for millions of business and consumer loans, by a full
percentage point to 8.75 percent, its highest level in nearly five
years.
</P>
<P>
   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New
York, said he viewed Greenspan's comments as evidence that the Fed
is growing more concerned about the economy's continued strength
despite the previous rate increases. Jones, who recently
anticipated two Fed rate increases in coming months, increased that
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed is going to have to get a little tougher if it wants
to curtail demand growth and achieve a soft landing to a more
sustainable rate of growth,'' Jones said, predicting quarter point
rate increases at the central bank's next three meetings, on March
21, May 16 and June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall demand for goods and services cannot chronically
exceed the underlying growth rate of supply,'' Greenspan said.
''The expansion of demand must moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the Fed's efforts to slow the economy are being
aided by financial markets' increases in long-term interest rates.
They have ''significantly'' raised corporate borrowing costs over
the past two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those higher business borrowing costs were prompting many
analysts to project that stock market gains may begin to slow as
increased interest payments cut into corporate profits, he said. If
this occurs, he said, it will help to slow the economy by reducing
the ''wealth effect'' that has powered consumers to spend more of
their incomes because of their rising stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But until this slowdown in demand occurs, the current expansion,
the longest in U.S. history at nine years this month, will remain
threatened by threats of ''financial and economic instability,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same conference, Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Arthur Levitt raised concerns about some investors'
growing reliance on borrowed money to fund their stock purchases, a
procedure known as buying on margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''These past few months, the level of margin debt has surged
even faster than the stock market,'' Levitt said. ''Too often,
investors are focusing on the upside -- without carefully
considering the downside.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many investors did not realize that brokerage firms have
the right to sell stocks bought on margin at a loss, without even
notifying the investor, if the market suddenly starts to decline.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the conference, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers credited the country's current good times to a
technological boom coming from computers and other
productivity-enhancing investments and the push by the Clinton
administration to turn soaring budget deficits into surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are enjoying a very special moment that confers a special
responsibility on public policy to work to broaden the base of our
prosperity,'' Summers said, calling for Congress to pass President
Clinton's expansion of tax incentives for the working poor.

<HEADLINE> London Gets Independent Candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Ken Livingstone, a former London mayor known as
''Red Ken'' who once tangled with Margaret Thatcher, defied Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Monday by announcing he would run for the
mayorship again.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone's revolt -- he had previously promised not to bolt
the Labor Party or run for the mayorship as an independent --
represents one of the most serious challenges in recent years from
the left to Blair's centrist leadership of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Blair used harsh language in criticizing the announcement by
Livingstone, who is likely to eclipse Labor Party candidate Frank
Dobson, a man chosen in what Livingstone called an unfair party
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe passionately that he would be a disaster -- a
financial disaster, a disaster in terms of crime and police and
business,'' Blair said of Livingstone. There is a widespread
perception that Blair and the Labor leadership did everything
possible to stop Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
   To Blair, Livingstone is a reminder the party's deep splits of
the 1980s, when the left was in the ascendant and the party was
unelectable. Livingstone's supporters are a ''ragbag of Trotskyists
and Tory newspapers,'' Blair said in November.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone, 54, accused the Labor Party of cheating him of its
nomination for mayor. He won 74,000 votes from individuals,
compared with 24,000 for Dobson, but still lost narrowly in a
complex primary that weighted the vote toward union groups,
lawmakers and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the electorate) have seen the commitments I have given,
they have weighed that against the way in which Labor conducted its
mayoral selection, they will choose which actually is the greater
crime,'' Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson, a former Health Secretary, said he was relieved that
Livingstone had finally made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, the ego has landed. Now, finally, the focus will be
on policy: jobs, crime and transport and Ken's ruinous policies for
London,'' Dobson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Conservative candidate, former lawmaker Steve Norris,
said Dobson's campaign was now ''dead in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   After Dobson won the Labor nomination, a poll commissioned by
the Evening Standard newspaper found that half the respondents
would vote for Livingstone if he ran as an independent, which was
double Dobson's support.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is a savvy media performer, and well known to
Londoners from his days as leader of the Greater London Council, an
overall city authority with limited power. He annoyed Thatcher with
populist initiatives such as slashing subway fares, and her
government abolished the council in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''My quick prediction, looking at the polls, is that Livingstone
will win be a mile,'' said Patrick Dunleavy, chair of the Public
Policy Group at the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   However, Livingstone enters the race with hardly any money or
organization, while Dobson has the full backing of the Labor
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has had its own problems with the mayor's
race. Its first candidate, novelist Jeffrey Archer, dropped out in
November after admitting he had asked a friend to lie for him in
connection with a libel suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrat candidate is Susan Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor will oversee a $5.3 billion budget and have
responsibilities that include the police, transportation, fire and
emergency services, but will have limited tax-raising powers.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue between Livingstone and Dobson is about financing
improvements to the London Underground system. Dobson, and Blair's
government, advocate a partnership between private and public
finance; Livingstone wants government to foot the whole bill.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's government created the mayor's job -- the first elected
mayor in London's history -- as part of its program of returning
some powers to regional and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Clapton Set To Join Rock Hall  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Clapton, whose solo career has veered
between pop hits and blues explorations, was set to join the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame for the third time Monday. His fellow
inductees included Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor and Earth, Wind &AMP;
Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Sixties hit-makers The Lovin' Spoonful, doo-wop pioneers The
Moonglows and embattled music executive Clive Davis were also to be
inducted in a ceremony at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire's Maurice White, who last week revealed his
battle with Parkinson's disease, was to make a rare appearance
performing with the band he founded.
</P>
<P>
   Clapton is already in the rock hall for his work as a member of
two groups, the Yardbirds and Cream.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the guitarist's solo career was being spotlighted.
His hits have spanned three decades, from ''After Midnight'' and
''Wonderful Tonight'' in the 1970s to the Grammy-winning ''Tears in
Heaven'' and ''Change the World'' in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He's kept current on the pop charts while not abandoning his
blues roots, which he explored on the ''From the Cradle'' album in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Blues-rocker Raitt was largely a cult favorite until her 10th
album, ''Nick of Time,'' won four Grammy Awards in 1989 and made
''Thing Called Love'' a hit. She started the Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Foundation to help older artists who didn't reap financial rewards
from their work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sweet Baby James'' Taylor was the quintessential 1970s
singer-songwriter with hits like ''Fire and Rain,'' ''How Sweet it
Is'' and ''Carolina in My Mind.'' He's still a major concert draw,
and now his children, Ben and Sally, have their own performing
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire favorites ''Shining Star'' and ''September''
are enjoying renewed popularity because of radio formats devoted to
1970s soul. White continues to record with the band but hasn't
toured since 1995 because of his Parkinson's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovin' Spoonful's string of mid-1960s hits included ''Do You
Believe in Magic?'' and ''Summer in the City.'' The Moonglows'
signature tune was ''Sincerely.''
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, who founded Arista Records and is now involved in a
public battle with Arista's owners to keep his job, the induction
is another well-timed salute. He guided the comeback of Carlos
Santana, who won eight Grammy Awards less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday were honored as
early influences on rock music.
</P>
<P>
   The names of Hall of Fame honorees are on exhibit at the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Restaurant Shooting Victim Mourned  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKINSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A former priest killed during a shooting
spree near Pittsburgh left nothing to chance when it came to how he
wanted his family and friends to remember him. He wrote his own
eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like this to be a celebration of gratitude and
hope,'' Joseph Healy wrote in a message read at his funeral by the
Rev. Leonard Tuozzolo. ''In deference to my ancestry, at least let
it be like an Irish wake.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuozzolo, one of Healy's former colleagues at Duquesne
University, said his friend wanted mourners to embrace life.
</P>
<P>
   Healy and two others were killed Wednesday by a gunman who also
injured two other people. Healy was shot while sitting at a booth
in a Burger King restaurant drinking his morning coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Taylor of Wilkinsburg, 39, is charged with three counts
of criminal homicide in Healy's death and the deaths of maintenance
man John Kroll, 55, and University of Pittsburgh student Emil
Sanielevici, 20
</P>
<P>
   About 900 mourners filled St. James Roman Catholic Church for
Healy's funeral, surprising his brother, George Healy, 72, a
retired priest from Hemet, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very much alive to everyone around him. I'm amazed to
see how appreciated he is,'' George Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Healy was one of 13 siblings, including four priests and
a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Healy was Duquesne's campus ministry director and a theology
instructor for 10 years until he gave up the priesthood in 1975
after 23 years. He got married, became a stepfather to his wife's
seven children and made a living as a professional storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe was my priest when I was a student at Duquesne,'' said
Lillian Meyers, a Pittsburgh psychologist. ''He was the epitome of
compassion.''

<HEADLINE> Magic 87, Wizards 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Garrity made a fadeaway jumper from the
top of the key as time expired to give the Orlando Magic a
come-from-behind 87-85 victory over the Washington Wizards on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chucky Atkins scored seven straight points for the Magic to turn
an 82-78 deficit into an 85-82 lead in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Washington rookie Richard Hamilton made a 3-point shot with 12.2
seconds left to tie the score. The Magic then called timeout and
ran a play for Garrity, who got the ball at the top of the key,
wheeled and threw up a jumper that went in as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity finished with only five points, shooting 2-for-6 from
the field. Atkins came off the bench to lead the Magic with 15
points. Rookie Corey Maggette added 14.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had a career-high 25 for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando has beaten Washington in 10 of their last 12 meetings
and did so this time without Ron Mercer, who was not in uniform
because of an ankle sprain suffered in Sunday's loss against
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic held a 51-38 rebounding edge, led by former Wizard Ben
Wallace's 16 rebounds. Orlando had 18 offensive rebounds to just
six for the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic's reserves, nicknamed ''The Magnificent Seven,''
scored 50 of the team's 87 points.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette came off the bench to lead a 14-2 second-quarter run
that helped the Magic take a 52-49 halftime lead. Hamilton got
rolling in the second half, scoring 15 of his points to help the
Wizards stay close.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Juwan Howard played his 15,000th minute in the first
quarter. ... The Magic now are 15-26 when Wallace wears his hair in
corn rows. ... Orlando now has outrebounded opponents 36 times. ...
The Wizards made 19 of 23 free throws while the Magic hit only 8 of
16.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Bitter Over Flood Aid  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Waiting to board a plane to inspect
the damage wrought by catastrophic floods, former first lady Graca
Machel summed up Mozambicans' growing bitterness over wealthy
nations' failure to hurry to her country's aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems the world has no conscience when it comes to human
life,'' said Machel, now the wife of former South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Planes and helicopters crisscrossed the southeast African nation
on Monday delivering food and other aid to hundreds of thousands of
flood victims. But an editorial in the country's main newspaper,
Noticias, echoed the sentiments of many Mozambicans: ''When the
West wants to intervene militarily anywhere in the world, they get
there in record time.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger focused on the hours and days after Feb. 27, when a
wall of water roared down the Limpopo River valley from neighboring
Zimbabwe, sweeping away hundreds of villages and thousands of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Seven South African air force helicopters rushed into action to
pluck flood victims from the tree branches and rooftops. They were
soon followed by two more choppers from impoverished Malawi. But in
the next few critical days, no one else pitched in.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are getting killed,'' U.N. World Food Program
spokesman David Schaad said on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appeals from Mozambican officials and aid agencies, it
wasn't until Sunday that additional helicopters arrived from
Germany, Britain and Spain. And U.S. military choppers will not be
flying over Mozambique until Tuesday or Wednesday, U.S. Air Force
Maj. Mike Young said.
</P>
<P>
   South African air force crews rescued more than 12,000 flood
victims from trees or rooftops. It will never be known how many
lives might have been saved with more helicopters and more boats.
</P>
<P>
   For all the praise it has received for its rescue mission, South
Africa itself had more helicopters in its air force. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Monday the aircraft were
unavailable because they were being used for rescue operations at
home or were on emergency standby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our forces and resources were stretched,'' Mamoepa said by
telephone from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic wrangling and poor storage facilities also impaired
the relief effort. There were reportedly delays in getting money to
fund the deployment of helicopters. And water destroyed 15 tons of
emergency food supplies in the Limpopo River valley.
</P>
<P>
   Africans have long complained of a double standard in how world
governments respond to emergencies on the continent compared to
those in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Mountain, special envoy for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, described the international response to the catastrophe as
''rather good'' but conceded it had shortcomings. Other U.N.
officials have said it was an unusual emergency in that it evolved
over several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was initially heavy rains causing some flooding without
indications that this was going to be a major crisis,'' U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday. ''Then you had a cyclone, which
turned the flooding into a major crisis indeed. And the rest is
just response time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to respond on a dime to a crisis so big that it
affects a million people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the Security Council on Monday
raised alarm about the floods' longer-term impact on the country's
recovery from a bloody civil war, saying that it was gravely
concerned the tragedy would hamper efforts to rid the country of an
estimated 2 million land mines.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley defended
the U.S. response to the crisis, saying critics should take into
account that many of the U.S. assets sent to Mozambique had to be
redeployed from Europe or even further -- ''a major undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've deployed them as quickly as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration is expected to announce
debt relief for Mozambique on Tuesday, government officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said Monday that the
controversy needs to be set aside, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not discuss this,'' he said. ''We should rather
concentrate on efforts to eliminate suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mozambicans whose homes were still intact were
collecting what remained of their possessions. In Chokwe, 125 miles
northeast of Maputo, about 11,000 people who moved out on Feb. 27
have returned home, said Lindsey Davies of the U.N. World Food
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said there were still acute shortages of fresh water in
the town. Some residents who could afford to pay for transport were
spending the night elsewhere to escape the smell of bodies and
rotting animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican officials raised their official flood death toll to
400 Monday, and expected it to grow as data came in and more bodies
were found. One hundred tons of food must be moved every day to
feed an estimated 250,000 people in 72 aid camps, said Georgia
Shaver, regional World Food Program manager.
</P>
<P>
   President Joaquim Chissano said flood victims would need to be
fed for at least 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the flooding, some observers here urged creation
of an international rapid-response team to cope with natural
disasters. Machel said she doubted anything would come of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time the international community has been
slow to respond when lives are being lost,'' she said. ''And it
won't be the last.

<HEADLINE> Australia Cyclone Fades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Cyclone Steve, which lashed Australia's
northwest coast with strong winds and flooding rains overnight,
weakened Tuesday after moving inland.
</P>
<P>
   However, weather warnings remained in place for parts of the
Pilbara region of Western Australia state, as forecasters warned
that the storm may strengthen again if it moves back offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The swirling winds and driving rain of a tropical cyclone
develops from a low pressure cell over the ocean, but the
conditions usually dissipate quickly once the eye of the storm
crosses overland.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Steve has formed three times and died twice in the past
10 days, as it traveled the length of Australia's north coast,
leaving a trail of destruction. A teen-ager drowned in the

   The Bureau of Meteorology said the eye of the cyclone crossed
the Western Australia coast near the outback town of Onslow, 684
miles north of the state capital or Perth, early Tuesday. It then
headed southwest, moving somewhat inland.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts dropped from 93 mph to 56 mph, and heavy rain was
still falling, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Walley, a spokeswoman for the state emergency service, said
late Monday that minor damage had been reported in the towns of
Wickham and Karratha, including fallen power lines and tiles ripped
off roofs. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the small towns in the region spent the night
battened down inside their homes after being warned to close
shutters, board up windows, tie down trailers and bring their pets
inside.

   Steve hit at Cairns in north Queensland state on Feb. 27, then
degenerated into a tropical low as it crossed overland before being
reborn as a cyclone in the Gulf of Carpentaria off northeast
Australia.

   Damage to buildings, crops and infrastructure is expected to
reach more than $9.1 million.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official accused of spying for
the Cuban government pleaded innocent Monday to federal charges of
communicating national defense secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, stood silently
during the brief arraignment hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is adamant that he is not guilty of these charges,'' said
lawyer Diane Ward, standing in for Faget's lawyer. ''He is adamant
that he did not do anything to betray his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Faget was indicted Friday on charges he relayed U.S. secrets to
a Cuban citizen and lied about contacts with Cuban government
officials over a 14-month period.
</P>
<P>
   He has been jailed without bond since his high-profile arrest
Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie notified the court that
the case will involve classified information that will require
Faget's attorney, Ed O'Donnell, to be cleared to handle government
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the Classified Information Protection Act also means
government documents will be filed under seal and the public will

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Killer Ruled Competent To Die  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled 4-1
Monday that a condemned child murderer and rapist is mentally
competent for execution, which would be the state's first since
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glen Coe, 43, is scheduled to die March 23 for the 1979
rape and murder of 8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Coe's attorneys argued before the Supreme Court that
the state's process for determining mental competency is flawed,
and that Coe was denied his constitutional rights during a January
competency hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled that Coe got a fair hearing and that he has
the mental capacity to understand his impending execution and
reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Adolpho A. Birch dissented, based on his stance that the
state's competency process is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The justices cited expert testimony that Coe suffers some type
of mental disorder, although the experts couldn't agree on the
extent or type of the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the justices said, a finding of mental disorder
''does not automatically translate into a finding of incompetency
to be executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, states cannot execute
inmates who are insane.
</P>
<P>
   The competency issue was Coe's last gasp in the state courts. He
can, however, appeal to the federal courts to review the state's
process for determining mental competency. He also can appeal to
Gov. Don Sundquist for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's attorneys said they planned to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Release Natrone Means  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers released running back
Natrone Means on Monday, a move Means said he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Means missed 15 of the last 22 games and rushed for just 277
yards on 125 carries last season. He spoke with Chargers general
manager Bobby Beathard about remaining with the team, but realizes
that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the way things have been going the last couple of weeks,
I didn't expect to be there anyway,'' Means told the San Diego
Union Tribune. ''I talked to Bobby and I said I understand the team
wanting to go in another direction. Now I can just concentrate on
getting healthy and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Means, 27, had arthroscopic surgery on both ankles and a knee
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard praised Means, who rushed for 1,350 yards in 1984,
helping San Diego reach its only Super Bowl. It was the only year
Means surpassed 1,000 yards in his seven-year career, five with the
Chargers and two with Jacksonville. He rejoined San Diego in March
1998, signing a six-year, $19.1 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love the guy,'' Beathard said. ''He brings an enthusiasm to
the game that every coach loves in a player. He's such a fearless
competitor, what guys call a warrior. It's just unfortunate that he
had to experience all those injuries. Since I've been here, some of
our greatest memories have been because of Natrone.''

<HEADLINE> Bucks 111, Hawks 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Sam Cassell had 21 points and 12 assists and
Glenn Robinson added 17 points as Milwaukee defeated Atlanta 111-78
Monday night to sweep the four-game season series from the Hawks
for the first time in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee, who had lost 10 of its previous 12 games, also got 16
points from Tim Thomas. The Bucks outrebounded Atlanta 51-21 in
handing the Hawks their second-worst loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, who have lost five of six and three straight on the
road, were led by Lorenzen Wright's 14 points. Isiah Rider, who did
not enter the game 1:31 remained in the first quarter, added 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's only lead of the game was at 2-0. Behind the spirited
play of Darvin Ham, who made his fourth straight start, Milwaukee
took control.
</P>
<P>
   Ham, who scored nine of his 11 points in the first quarter,
provided two slam dunks over Dikembe Mutombo. On the second one,
Mutombo received a delay of game warning for arguing a foul call.
</P>
<P>
   Ham also had a career-high 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the first quarter with a 30-19 lead, the second
quarter was much of the same for Milwaukee. Cassell finished with
14 points and Robinson added 13 for a 58-36 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Danny Manning was not in uniform for Milwaukee for the
second straight game. He strained his right knee at New York on
March 4 and did not return. He also missed the Minnesota game last
Saturday. ... The Hawks are now 0-6 on Mondays. ... Entering
Monday's game, Atlanta's 23-34 record was its worst start through
57 games since the 1980-81 season. ... Milwaukee's largest margin
of victory over Atlanta was a 124-88 decision in 1972.

'Super Tuesday' Primaries Loom
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential hopefuls were out in full force today
campaigning on opposite ends of the country the day before the make-or-break
''Super Tuesday'' presidential primary. Public opinion polls had Democrat Al
Gore ahead of Bill Bradley virtually everywhere. Republican George W. Bush's
position wasn't as commanding, although he led John McCain in the polls in
several key states, including Ohio, Maryland, Georgia, Missouri and in the
winner-take-all competition for 162 California delegates. McCain's strength was
in New England, and he and Bush battled fiercely in New York.

Senate GOP Fined $20,000

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fund-raising arm of the Senate Republicans agreed to
pay a $20,000 penalty for using unregulated soft money to help elect GOP
congressional candidates, according to documents released today by the Federal
Election Commission. The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, agreed to pay
a $5,000 penalty for accepting a contribution from a national bank, in violation
of federal election laws. Soft money -- unlimited donations from corporations,
unions and individuals -- cannot be used to directly aid federal candidates. But
political parties can use soft money to jointly benefit candidates running for
federal offices and candidates running for state and local offices.

Smarter Baby Milk Formula Sought

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Enriching bottle formula with two essential fatty acids
found in mother's milk can cause a significant improvement in the mental
development of babies, a new study says. The supplemented formula does not
assure intellectual genius, said researchers at the Retina Foundation of the
Southwest in Dallas, but the study does show that adding the fatty acids to
bottled formula can closely mimic the effect of mother's milk on brain
development. Experts said the study is important because it is the first to
compare formula supplemented with the fatty acids with formula without the

<HEADLINE> Gebhardt First Racer To Checkpoint  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAINY PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Mushers in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race headed into the Alaska Range on Monday, with Paul Gebhardt
leading the 80 teams into the Rainy Pass checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt, who finished sixth last year, arrived at the remote
Rainy Pass Lodge at 11:01 a.m. Alaska time (3:01 p.m. EST) with the
16 dogs he started the race with a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going good. I'm happy. They are pretty race hard,''
Gebhardt said as he prepared freeze-dried food for the dogs as they
napped on beds of hay.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the 30s forced mushers to slow their pace to
keep from overheating their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the afternoon, if the sun's out, it's going to be really
bad,'' he said of the heat while resting in Skwentna. ''You've got
to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   For two hours Gebhardt, from Kasilof, had the stunning alpine
views to himself, but then others started arriving. Three-time
winner Jeff King of Denali Park was second into the checkpoint at
12:57 p.m., followed by Mitch Seavey of Seward at 1:16 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Doug Swingley of Lincoln, Mont., was fourth
at 2:06 p.m., about a half-hour ahead of five-time winner Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers and Ramy Brooks of Healy. Rick Mackey of
Nenana arrived at 3:24 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another 12 mushers were climbing the 30 miles of trail from the
Finger Lakes checkpoint to Rainy Pass.
</P>
<P>
   King said one of his dogs went the wrong way around a tree and
broke its tie line. When he called the dog, it bolted past the team
but soon joined up again and ran for about a mile before King was
able to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   Seavey said he damaged his sled when it hit something under the
snow and bent the runner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It flipped right over. I was dragging down the trail. I was
glad I didn't lose the team,'' he said. ''The sled is essentially
not drivable.''
</P>
<P>
   He was waiting in Rainy Pass to see if another sled could be
flown to him from McGrath.
</P>
<P>
   A record 81 teams took to the trail Sunday from Wasilla to
officially begin the 1,150-mile race to Nome. The trail goes
through Knik, home of Joe Redington Sr. who started the race in
1973 and died of cancer last June at age 82. From there it
continues through muskeg and forests.
</P>
<P>
   Redington's son, Raymie, was the 17th musher into Finger Lake.
He said he lost time when he took a wrong turn out of Skwentna and
went 15 miles out of his way.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's probably watching me mess up again,'' said Redington,
thinking about his father and the eight Iditarods they did
together.
</P>
<P>
   The race was begun to commemorate the lifesaving relay of
diphtheria serum to Nome by mushers in 1925. Swingley holds the
race record of 9 days, 2 hours, 42 minutes set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The teams, which include 29 rookies, are competing for a share
of a $525,000 purse, the largest ever. The winner gets $60,000 and
a new pickup truck. Prize money will be paid to the first 30
finishers.
</P>
<P>
   One musher already has scratched from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ted English of Wasilla flipped his sled and landed hard on his
back on glare ice Saturday afternoon just outside Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old part-time carpenter struck his head on his sled
and hurt his right leg and hip. English decided Sunday that his
injuries were serious enough to force him to become the first
musher to drop out.

<HEADLINE> Vikings to Dan Marino: Let's Talk  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- At least one team in the NFL doesn't think
Dan Marino is washed up.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Green is trying to lure the league's career passing
leader to Minnesota, where he would become the Vikings' eighth
starter in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Marino turns 39 this year and has spent his entire 17-year
career in Miami. He is considering an offer from the Vikings, but
also considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings feature receivers Cris Carter and Randy Moss, but
they also lost Pro Bowl offensive linemen Randall McDaniel and Jeff
Christy to rival Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dan called me, and Dan said that the Vikings had offered him a
contract and he was thinking about it,'' Carter told WPTV in West
Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before Minnesota called, I think Dan was going to retire,''
Carter said from his home in Boca Raton, Fla. ''I think it really
rekindled some interest that he had maybe four or five months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also said Marino was concerned about uprooting his
children.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was offered Minnesota's starting quarterback job last
week in talks with Green, two sources close to Marino and speaking
on condition of anonymity confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who has never won a championship, most likely will
decide by the end of the week, one of the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was first reported Sunday night by ESPN and Fox Sports
Net, citing unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just flabbergasted,'' Dolphins president Eddie Jones said.
''I have no idea about Dan Marino and any report about him going
anyplace. I know nothing about where Dan's head is at or what he
plans to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said for the first time Monday that if Marino plays
next season, the Dolphins want him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Danny has been told he can come back,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Green didn't return phone calls from The Associated Press on
Monday. Last week, he told his staff not to discuss the team's
quarterback situation in light of heavy criticism of his
declaration that Daunte Culpepper, his top draft pick last year,
would enter camp as the projected starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Green told WAFN Radio in Miami he'd love it if Marino and
the Vikings pursued their elusive championship rings together.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is a perfect merger of a guy who wants one more
year to get it done the right way and a team that's looking for
that one guy who wants one more year to get it right,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings haven't offered Jeff George a contract, even though
he went 9-3 after coming off the bench last season to replace
Randall Cunningham, who was demoted 5{ games into his new $28
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   George's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he assumed the Vikings
would make a push for his client's return once they freed up enough
cap room. Steinberg said he was flabbergasted by the Vikings'
pursuit of Marino instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I understand what's going on in Minnesota? No,'' Steinberg
said. ''Usually when a guy goes 9-3 and takes his team to the
playoffs, the team tries to extend his contract very quickly. It
seemed like a marriage made in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has refused a big pay cut and probably will be
jettisoned June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who has not attracted much interest from other teams,
threw 12 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions in 1999, by far the
worst ratio of his career. He also missed five games and most of a
sixth because of a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, Marino led the Dolphins to a 20-17 victory over
Seattle in the first round. But the team was embarrassed 62-7 the
next week against Jacksonville, when the Dolphins trailed 38-0
before Marino even completed a pass.
</P>
<P>
   After the most lopsided loss in Dolphins history and the most
miserable afternoon of his career, Marino said: ''I've never
experienced a game like this in my life. Even as a kid, I've never
had a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino is the most prolific passer in NFL history. In 17
seasons, he has completed 4,967 passes for 61,361 yards and 420
touchdowns, all NFL records.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries have taken a toll, and Marino's quarterback rating
of 67.4 ranked 30th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   He became a free agent last month after voiding his contract
with Miami. The Dolphins then signed free agent quarterback Jay
Fiedler.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings haven't had the money to do much in the free agent
market. But Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff, had discussions with the
team on a contract that would fit within the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who had a mediocre 1999, could sign a deal with easily
reachable incentives that would not squeeze the Vikings too much.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, who have shaken up their roster and coaching staff
this offseason, are hoping Marino won't pass up a shot at playing
with Carter and Moss, who thrived last year with the equally
strong-armed George.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins signed Fiedler to a three-year, $3.8 million
contract, it seemed clear Marino had played his last game in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Court Reverses Most of NBC Verdict  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Monday
reversed a defamation verdict and threw out $525,000 in damages
against ''Dateline NBC'' over a report on truck driver fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Trucker Peter Kennedy and Classic Carriers claimed NBC
misrepresented itself by saying it planned a positive story about
the trucking industry but then aired a report on dangers of tired
truckers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC insisted the only promise it made Kennedy and company owner
Ray Veilleux was to accurately report on Kennedy's trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the outset, it was NBC's position that they should not be
found liable for an accurate news broadcast,'' said NBC lawyer
Bernard Kubetz. He called the decision, which reversed a 1998
verdict, a victory for the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled against the
plaintiffs' claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress
and invasion of privacy. But it left intact a limited
misrepresentation claim by Veilleux, plus his wife's claim for loss
of consortium. That portion of the verdict was sent back to the
U.S. District Court for reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Robitzek, who represented the trucking firm, said he had
not reviewed the decision. He declined to comment except to say,
''I'm clearly disappointed with the result.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 program stemmed from a crash in which a tractor-trailer
driven by a trucker who falsified his logbook veered into the
breakdown lane of the Maine Turnpike and killed four teen-agers in
a car.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dateline NBC'' arranged to tag along with Kennedy during a
cross-country trip for a followup story.
</P>
<P>
   In its broadcast, it reported that Kennedy called his logbook a
''lie book'' and drove from Chicago to Boston without stopping to
sleep as law required.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, NBC's Fred Francis asked Kennedy what he was
doing. The driver replied: ''Falsifying my log book.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also received word that a drug test taken during the
trip showed residues of marijuana and amphetamines. ''Dateline''
reported on the results, which Robitzek said should have been kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Robitzek also said the pressure to drive extra hours came from
Kennedy having to accommodate the television crew's delays.
</P>
<P>
   Kubetz said the best defense was the accuracy of the
''Dateline'' report, which was based on statements made by Veilleux
and Kennedy and on observations during the trip.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Arrest More Militants  </HEADLINE>
By ABDEL-RAHMAN KHABEISA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) -- In the wake of a foiled anti-Israel
attack last week, Palestinian police raided a suspected Islamic
militant hide-out, and Israeli media reported Monday that a Jewish
settler had smuggled the would-be bombers into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian security forces confiscated what appeared to be
bomb-making materials and arrested at least one man in a sweep of a
suspected hide-out of the militant Islamic group Hamas, officials
and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media reported that the apartment in the northern West
Bank town of Tulkarem served as a bomb factory for the militant
Hamas group.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian security officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they found sulfur and three metal canisters of
acetone in the one-room apartment. The chemicals, found alongside
fire extinguishers and empty metal containers, were believed to be
raw materials for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment was sealed Sunday by Palestinian police, its metal
door chained shut. Mattresses, items of clothing and a Hebrew
newspaper were strewn on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a nearby tile factory, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the room was rented to two Palestinian laborers
from the Gaza Strip, who cross daily into Israel daily for work. He
said he saw one man arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Israeli security forces raided a hide-out of the
Hamas cell in the Arab town of Taibeh, killing four suspects.
Israeli offiicals said they had been planning a major attack. A
fifth militant was captured and a sixth Hamas activist was believed
to be on the run. Israeli media said the man arrested in Tulkarem
was the fugitive from Taibeh.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media reported Monday that members of the cell were
smuggled into Israel by an Israeli from the Jewish settlement of
Nisanit, in northern Gaza. The reports, on Israel's radio and
television stations said the Israeli was paid to take the bombers
out of Gaza in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are rarely searched at the checkpoints separating
Israel from the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Arale Tzur, head of the Gaza settlers council, suggested that
the Israeli was unaware of the bombing plot and thought he was
taking workers who didn't have permits to jobs in Israel.
Authorities have uncovered numerous such cases in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian security officials said Israel tipped them off about
the Tulkarem house.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben-Ami, the Israeli police minister, said that a state
of alert declared after the Taibeh raid might be scaled down in the
coming few days in light of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired late at an Israeli bus a few miles north of the
West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, border police spokesman Peretz
Ratzon said. Three bullets damaged the bus windows but caused no
injuries, Ratzon said. Police were looking for suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt on Monday to discuss Mideast peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian talks broke down early last month over land
disputes. The Palestinians refused to accept land offered by Israel
in a promised military withdrawal from the West Bank. They want
Israel to withdraw from Arab suburbs around Jerusalem but Israel
has refused, saying it will decide alone on the location of
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have also missed a Feb. 13 deadline to draw up the
framework of a final peace accord.

<HEADLINE> No.11 Duke 79, North Carolina 76  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MACENKA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Lauren Rice and Georgia Schweitzer
scored 16 points apiece and No. 11 Duke won its first Atlantic
Coast Conference championship by surviving a late North Carolina
rally for a 79-76 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Five players scored in double figures to help Duke (26-5) defeat
North Carolina for the first time in five tries in the ACC
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils needed the balance and production on a night
when North Carolina (18-12) rallied from nine points down in the
final seven minutes, only to come up short in its bid for its sixth
ACC crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels' Nikki Teasley had 31 points, including 7-for-11
showing from three-point range. But she also figured prominently in
several players that hurt North Carolina, including a five-point
play in the first half that put Duke ahead for most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Teasley's final 3-pointer a 23-footer from the left wing, made
it 72-71 with 1:52 left, North Carolina's first lead since 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer's layup with 71 seconds put Duke back on top and
after a missed 3-pointer by Teasley sailed out of bounds, Missy
West sank a foul shot that made Duke's lead 74-72 at the 39-second
mark.
</P>
<P>
   After Teasley missed another 3-pointer, the Tar Heels were
called for a loose ball foul in the scramble for the rebound. Duke
sealed it by making three of four free throws in the closing
seconds and getting a fast-break layup from Michele Matyasovsky.
</P>
<P>
   West added 14 points for Duke, Krista Gingrich had 11 and Sheana
Mosch 10.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina also got 15 points from Juana Brown, 14 from
Jackie Higgins and 12 from LaQuanda Barksdale.

<HEADLINE> Nine West to pay $34 million to settle price-fixing charges  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nine West Group Inc., one of the nation's
largest suppliers of women's shoes, settled a price-fixing case
Monday by agreeing to pay states $34 million and stop dictating
what stores charge for its footwear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in 56 U.S.
states and territories had alleged that the company violated
antitrust laws stipulating when retailers could offer shoes at
reduced prices and distributing lists of shoes that could not be
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's share was more than $880,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West sells shoes under such brand names as Nine West,
Amalfi, Bandolino, 9 &AMP; Co., Calico, Easy Spirit, Evan-Picone,
Pappagallo, Capezio, Calvin Klein, Selby, and Enzo Angiolini.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ''sends a strong signal to companies that fixing
resale prices violates the law and will result in enforcement
actions,'' said Richard G. Parker, director of the FTC's Bureau of
Competition.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers who did not adhere to Nine West policies were
threatened with cancellations, denied orders or were not given
discounts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, competition among retailers selling Nine West
brands was restricted and the price of the company's shoes were
kept artificially high, the FTC's complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Nine West, based in White Plains, N.Y., said the
settlement was not an admission of liability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that this was the most efficient manner in which to
resolve this issue, avoiding substantial legal expense and
management time,'' said Jacki Nemerov, president of Jones Apparel
Group, which acquired Nine West last summer. The alleged price
fixing occurred from January 1988 to July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company entered into two separate settlements, one with the
attorneys general of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana
Islands and Guam. The other is with the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC settlement prohibits Nine West from setting the price at
which retailers can advertise, promote or sell shoes or coercing
retailers to stick to any one price. The company also cannot notify
dealers in advance that they are subject to suspension if they sell
Nine West shoes below a designated price. Nine West must also
notify its dealers that they have the right to set the price for
the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the states requires a payment of $34 million.
Of this, no more than $3.5 million will cover attorney's fees,
while the rest will be used to fund women's health, educational,
vocational and safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was filed in U.S. District Court in New York
immediately after a lawsuit was filed against Nine West in the same
court. The agreement resolves the suit, but gives the court
jurisdiction over the terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''When even one business won't play by the rules and illegally
overcharges its customers, everybody gets hurts,'' said South
Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon. He is proposing that the
state use its portion of the money to assist rape victims and
crisis pregnancy centers.

<HEADLINE> Sources: Va. Rep. Won't Seek Term  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Rep. Thomas Bliley, an ally of Virginia's
tobacco industry and chairman of the powerful committee that
handles tobacco legislation, won't seek re-election this year,
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Republican plans to announce Wednesday that he
will not seek an eleventh term, according to two sources within the
GOP who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley has been chairman of the House Commerce Committee since
1995, personally overseeing much of the legislation that affects
the nation's tobacco companies. Many of his constituents work at
Philip Morris' Richmond cigarette factory, the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley did not return a telephone message left at his Richmond
home seeking comment. He was at Gov. Jim Gilmore's annual meeting
with the state's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Bliley might retire after the 2000 session has
lingered for about two years. Because of a six-year limit on
committee chairmanships, Bliley would have to give up his
chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley becomes the 30th House member -- 23 Republicans and 7
Democrats -- to announce he will not seek re-election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now control the House, 222-211 with two
independents, Virgil Goode of Virginia, who left the Democratic
Party in January and caucuses with the GOP, and Rep. Bernie Sanders
of Vermont, who generally votes with the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Gun Campaign Launching in Colo.  </HEADLINE>
By JON SARCHE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER -- Both sides of the gun-control debate cheered the launch
Monday of a $1 million Colorado public awareness campaign to deter
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Project Exile, patterned after similar programs in
Virginia, New York, Massachusetts Louisiana and Texas, brought
together gun-control advocates, the National Rifle Association and
local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates James Brady, who was wounded by a gunman
firing at President Reagan, and Tom Mauser, father of a Columbine
High School victim, attended.
</P>
<P>
   So did Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National
Rifle Association. NRA President Charlton Heston was scheduled to
attend but bowed out, blaming scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both sides said they still disagree on
whether stricter gun laws are needed, but both said tough
prosecution of gun-related crimes would be a deterrent and ensure
prison time for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some believe it is all we need to do, others believe it is the
least we should do,'' said U.S. Attorney Tom Strickland, who helped
organize Colorado Project Exile in October.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, his office charged 78 people with federal
weapons violations, almost double the number charged in all of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland said the program has brought unprecedented
cooperation among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies
to ensure that people charged with weapons violations are
prosecuted in the jurisdiction with the strongest applicable law
and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, Project Exile has deterred gun crimes and
changed criminal behavior, LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want violent criminals that touch guns, gang members that
touch guns, drug dealers that touch guns and violent juveniles that
touch guns to know that the National Rifle Association is their
worst enemy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers were welcomed by a crowd of about 200 people
with applause that drowned out boos, hisses and catcalls by
opponents of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would we want a spokesman for gun groups throughout the
country to get on a podium with Jim Brady, whose whole intent is to
disarm America and register all guns?'' asked Ray Hickman of Rocky
Mountain Gun Owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want abuses against law-abiding citizens whose
biggest mistake was they did not understand the 20,000 gun laws we
already have,'' Hickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauser, whose son Daniel was among the 13 killed at Columbine
High School last April, now works for SAFE Colorado to promote
stricter gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have been through this, what strikes you most is the
great burning desire to not have other parents go through this, to
not go through the burning pain we went through,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's stocks slipped Tuesday morning on selling
of high technology issues. The dollar edged higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 57.11 points,
or 0.29 percent, to 19,739.24 at the end of the morning session. On
Monday, the average closed down 131.19 points, or 0.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.74 yen, up 0.16 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 107.53 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, investors initially bought selected issues
on dips following a three-day decline in the Nikkei average.
</P>
<P>
   But selling of high-priced technology and telecommunications
issues pushed the average into a negative territory. Traders said
selling by investors to lock in profits ahead of the March 31
fiscal year-end in Japan was also weighing on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 196.70 to
10,170.50 at Monday's close, wiping out nearly all of Friday's
202-point jump.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 12.31 points, or 0.75 percent, to 1,637.52.
The TOPIX closed down 36.66 points, or 2.17 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot in the market was Mitsubishi Motors. The Nihon
Keizai financial newspaper said Tuesday that Mitsubishi is
negotiating for DaimlerChrysler AG to take about a 30 percent stake
in it. A Mitsubishi spokesman refused to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar gained against the yen after
Taichi Sakaiya, chief of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, said
private consumption for the January-March period may not be
''dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs of Japan's economic recovery recently, but
many officials remain cautious about the economy's full pickup.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.27 yen, up from
103.26 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7850 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7650 percent. Its price
fell 0.17 point to 100.12.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Svetlana Abrosimova had a feeling. Tamika
Williams had the moves.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had 16 points and Abrosimova had a career-high 10
assists as No. 1 Connecticut beat No. 17 Boston College 79-54 on
Monday in the semifinals of the Big East tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I passed it to her, I was so sure she was going to
make it,'' said Abrosimova of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams nearly did, shooting 8-of-10 from the field. She was
7-of-8 in UConn's 85-41 quarterfinal victory over St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's March. You can't lose,'' Williams said. ''This is why you
come to Connecticut, to play the big games.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn (29-1) will play No. 8 Rutgers in the championship game
Tuesday night. Rutgers beat No. 5 Notre Dame 81-72 in the second
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Huskies have won the last six tournament
titles.
</P>
<P>
   It was BC's first appearance in the semifinals since 1990. The
Eagles have not been to a final since 1987 when they lost to
Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies outscored Boston College 50-18 in the paint using a
deep and talented bench to wear down the Eagles (25-8). UConn
reserves accounted for 39 points.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's defense pressured BC into 16 first half turnovers, and
on the offensive end, the Huskies went inside to Williams early and
often.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn up 6-4, the power forward scored eight of the next 14
points. Shea Ralph and Asjha Jones combined for six in the 14-0 run
to give UConn its biggest lead of the half, 20-4 with 12:48
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Five straight BC turnovers kept the Eagles scoreless for nearly
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They put us back on our heels and made us a little
tentative,'' BC coach Cathy Inglese said. ''If they get on a run or
two, it can be a long night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' inside game began to heat up midway through the
half, and the spark was sophomore forward Becky Gottstein, who
finished with 19 points. She hit three of BC's last four field
goals and the Eagles trailed 34-23 at the break, but would get no
closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies continued the pressure in the post to start the
second half got the same results. They opened with a 12-4 on five
inside baskets and a pair of free throws to go up 46-27 with 13:52
left. UConn led by as much as 32 in the period.
</P>
<P>
   UConn capitalized with 31 points on 25 BC turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Gottstein was playing in her third straight game since returning
from a right ankle stress fracture that sidelined her for six
weeks. Before the injury she led the conference with 10 rebounds a
game and was the second leading scorer on the team. She got five
boards in the first half, but was held to a pair in the second.
</P>
<P>
   UConn outrebounded the Eagles 39-31. Abrosimova and Kelly
Schumacher had six apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Alissa Murphy had 13 points for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   The teams met just once in the regular season, and BC's speedy
guards took control early. UConn fought back from a 3-point
halftime deficit and held on for an 84-77 win.
</P>
<P>
   Defense and depth made the difference on Monday, said UConn
coach Geno Auriemma.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight the defensive effort was outstanding by everyone, and
that gave us an opportunity to do what we did on the offensive
end,'' said Auriemma, who rotates six players in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ''BC's inside kids were going to have to contend with a lot of
our post players, not just one or two.''

<HEADLINE> Capitals; Panthers Battle For Top  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than two months ago, coach Ron Wilson
felt it was ''almost unreasonable'' to think his Washington
Capitals could catch the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing he said ''almost.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Washington tied Florida atop the Southeast Division.
On Tuesday, it's a schedule-maker's wish come true when the
Panthers visit the Capitals with first place, momentum and the
psychological edge on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever wins the game gets a little bit of an advantage in the
final 15 games,'' Wilson said Monday. ''It's easier to be in the
lead than to be chasing. Psychologically for either team, it's kind
of big.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, the Capitals were 16 points behind the
Panthers, had a losing record and faced the grim prospect of
missing the playoffs for the second year in a row. A team meeting
on an overnight flight from Vancouver before Christmas and the
players' gradual belief and acceptance of Wilson's new conservative
game plan helped turned things around.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals (34-21-11) have become the hottest team in hockey.
They are 22-5-6 since Christmas, and workhorse goalie Olaf Kolzig
has a 23-4-4 record and 1.69 goals against average in the last 31
games.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was selected the NHL's player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could be heading toward the MVP of the whole league if he
continues to play the way he is,'' Florida coach Terry Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Capitals moved closer to the top with a 3-2
overtime victory over the Panthers at the MCI Center, but it was
before the 3-1 victory in the Jan. 19 game at Florida that Wilson
expressed his doubts that first place was within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was almost unreasonable,'' Wilson said. ''I never really
gave it much thought until a couple of weeks ago. Our thoughts were
making the playoffs. Our focus was trying to catch Ottawa -- we were
eight or nine points behind them. It's less of a distance to Ottawa
than Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals have passed Ottawa and, if they pass the Panthers
and win the division, will be guaranteed one of the top three seeds
in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The schedule is in their favor:
The Caps play 10 of their last 16 at home, while Florida has nine
of 16 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   And home is starting to be a good place to play. The Caps had
just one sellout through January, but the MCI Center has been full
for the last two of the last three home games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've managed to convince some people that we're for real,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one serious concern for the Capitals, it's injuries.
After a healthy first half of the season, they are without Richard
Zednik (concussion), Sergei Gonchar (concussion), Jan Bulis
(dislocated shoulder) and James Black (broken leg) for the Panthers
game.
</P>
<P>
   With Joe Reekie (bruised foot) and Dmitri Mironov (sore
tailbone) also ailing, the Caps recalled Alexei Tezikov and Rob
Zettler from Portland on Monday to make sure they would have enough
defensemen. Left wing Jeff Tomes was sent down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Panthers haven't collapsed -- they've simply been
tracked down. Florida needs to get momentum back in its bid to get
a decent seeding in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question it's one of the biggest games we've had at
this point in the season in a long time,'' right wing Scott
Mellanby said. ''We're not going to go in there and win and feel
like, 'OK, we won the division.' Vice versa, if you lose, it's not
over. There's a long ways to go, but it's a huge game.''

Primary Campaigning Heats Up
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pursuit for the presidential nomination heightened
today as candidates campaigned on opposite coasts a day before the ''Super
Tuesday'' primary. Public opinion polls had Democrat Al Gore ahead of Bill
Bradley virtually everywhere. Republican George W. Bush's position wasn't as
commanding, although he led John McCain in the polls in several key states,
including Ohio, Maryland, Georgia, Missouri and in the winner-take-all
competition for 162 California delegates.

OPEC Boost May Not Help Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although gas prices are already almost $1.50 a gallon or
more, the government said today prices are likely to jump another 20 cents by
May or even higher as the summer driving season takes hold. The oil exporting
countries may boost production soon to ease the acute shortage that has seen
crude prices climb to nearly $32 a barrel, but the additional oil, even if
pumped immediately, ''would undoubtedly be too late'' to keep gasoline prices
from rising, according to a report released by the Energy Department.

Palestinians Arrest More Militants
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) -- In the wake of a foiled anti-Israel attack last
week, Palestinian police raided a suspected Islamic militant hide-out, and
Israeli media reported Monday that a Jewish settler had smuggled the would-be
bombers into Israel. Palestinian security forces confiscated what appeared to be
bomb-making materials and arrested at least one man in a sweep of a suspected
hide-out of the militant Islamic group Hamas, officials and witnesses said.
Israeli media reported that the apartment in the northern West Bank town of
Tulkarem served as a bomb factory for the militant Hamas group.

Kosovo Boundary Control Tightened
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers stepped up efforts Monday to
control Kosovo's borders, hoping to stop the flow of weapons and guerrillas
believed to be fueling tensions in the volatile region just inside Serbia
proper. The move comes amid increasing hostility near the town of Dobrosin, a
predominantly ethnic Albanian village in southern Serbia. That area has been the
site of sporadic clashes between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serb police, and
there are fears of renewed fighting similar to the conflict in Kosovo last year,
which led to NATO attacks against Yugoslavia.

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Rep. Thomas Bliley, an ally of Virginia's tobacco
industry and chairman of the powerful committee that handles tobacco
legislation, won't seek re-election this year, sources said today. The
68-year-old Republican plans to announce Wednesday that he will not seek an
eleventh term, according to two sources within the GOP who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bliley has been chairman of the House Commerce Committee since 1995,
personally overseeing much of the legislation that affects the nation's tobacco
companies. Many of his constituents work at Philip Morris' Richmond cigarette
factory, the world's largest.

82-78 deficit into an 85-82 lead in the final minute. Washington rookie Richard
Hamilton made a 3-point shot with 12.2 seconds left to tie the score. The Magic

<HEADLINE> Suns 100, Heat 92  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- In the best game to date for Phoenix's so-called
Backcourt 2000, Penny Hardaway matched his season-high with 28
points and Jason Kidd handed out a season-best 17 assists Monday
night as the Suns beat the Miami Heat 100-92 for their 11th
consecutive home victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd also had 10 points and fell one rebound short of a
triple-double. Tom Gugliotta added 15 points and Shawn Marion 13.
Seven players scored in double figures for the Suns, who have won
11 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Miami erased most of a 26-point first-half deficit but couldn't
quite make it all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning, guarded by four different Suns, had 25 points
and nine rebounds. P.J. Brown added 22 points and Tim Hardaway had
10 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat used their trademark stifling defense in a 19-0
third-quarter run. P.J. Brown scored seven of his 10 third-quarter
points in the surge as the Heat sliced the lead to 66-61 on
Mourning's three-point play with 5:51 remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Suns, who shot 64 percent in the first half, made
just one of their first 11 shots before regrouping to hang on to a
76-69 lead going into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miami cut it to 78-75 on Anthony Carter's two free throws with
10:30 to play and 83-79 on Clarence Weatherspoon's inside basket
with 8:11 remaining. But Kidd scored on a drive and Hardaway banked
in a lob pass from Gugliotta to put Phoenix ahead 87-79 with 7:24
to go. The Heat never got closer than five again.
</P>
<P>
   Four nights after they beat Central Division leader Indiana
118-87, the Suns duplicated the dominance in the first half against
Atlantic Division-leading Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway scored eight in a 10-0 run that put the Suns up
27-16 in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Six Phoenix players scored during a 14-0 outburst that gave the
Suns a 59-34 lead on Penny Hardaway's jumper with 1:36 to play in
the half. Phoenix led 62-36 before the Heat scored twice in the
last 10 seconds to make it 62-40 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd had 13 assists in the first half. Hardaway was 8-for-10
from the field, Gugliotta 6-for-6 and Shawn Marion 4-for-4 in the
first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kidd had eight assists in the first quarter, when the Suns
shot 77 percent (17-for-22), their best shooting quarter of the
season. ... Gugliotta scored 11 of the Suns' first 13 points. ...
Phoenix had 20 fastbreak points in the first half to the Heat's
three. ... Miami has lost 10 of 13 on the road. ... The Suns' 62
points matched the most allowed by Miami in the first half this
season. ... Phoenix swept Miami this season and is 20-3 all-time
against the Heat.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Campaign on Both Coasts  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping for a Super Tuesday worthy of the name,
George W. Bush and Al Gore campaigned on opposite coasts Monday in
parallel pursuit of the victories needed to settle their parties'
nominating struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rest is for another day,'' said Gore's rival, Bill Bradley.
And on the eve of a virtual nationwide presidential primary with
contests in all regions of the country, all sides seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain said he sensed a backlash developing
against campaign commercials aired by Bush and ''his sleazy Texas
buddies'' in New York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runners, Bush and Gore, both courted Jewish voters as
they tailored their messages as much to the general election as
Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tolerance can never be assumed, and it always must be
taught,'' Bush said at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles
where he also stressed his support for ''a safe and secure
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in New York, told a Jewish organization he would be a
''good and helpful and loyal friend'' to Israel if elected to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls had Gore ahead of Bradley virtually
everywhere. Bush's position wasn't as commanding, although he led
McCain in the polls in several key states, including Ohio,
Maryland, Georgia, Missouri and in the winner-take-all competition
for 162 California delegates. McCain's strength was in New England,
and he and Bush battled fiercely in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain girded for elections in 13 states in all, 11
primaries and two caucuses, with 613 delegates up for grabs.
Democrats had contests in 15 states and the American Samoa, 11
primaries and five caucuses with 1,315 delegates in play. Many
states predicted record voter turnouts.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the Bush campaign was making 2 million
get-out-the-vote calls in nine states in the Super Tuesday lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, though, the Texas governor's high command was
looking ahead. They said he will try to raise as much as $10
million in the coming weeks for use against the Democrats. They
also said there have been informal discussions about expanding his
team of advisers for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, upset about privately sponsored environmental ads,
announced at day's end that he had filed a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission alleging the ads were illegally
coordinated with Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations, Gore signaled support for moving the U.S. Embassy to
Jerusalem and hinted broadly that he would look with disfavor on
any attempt by the Palestinian Authority to declare an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, his rhetoric bordered on opaque. Asked
about moving the embassy, for example, he said the question should
be decided as part of ''final status'' peace talks among the
Mideast nations. But, he added, ''The outcome I think is hardly in
doubt and my desires are the same as your desires.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also visited a physical rehabilitation
facility in Brooklyn, N.Y., where he criticized McCain and --
especially -- Bush for their approach to health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under his leadership, the state of Texas now ranks 49th in
health insurance for children. And health insurance for women?
Fiftieth. Fifty out of 50.'' Aides said his statistics came from a
study done by Families USA, which is closely aligned with
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks on tolerance came after weeks of controversy over
his visit to Bob Jones University, which had banned interracial
dating and was attacked by critics for anti-Catholic views. His
remarks were laced with references to anti-Semitism and the
Holocaust, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anti-Semitism once destroyed the moral foundations of one of
the most educated nations on earth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring it necessary to battle intolerance, he said, ''I
believe our nation is chosen by God and commissioned by history to
be a model to the world of justice and inclusion and diversity
without division.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day in San Diego, where he criticized Gore over
education. Gore wants to build more schools, Bush said, while he
wants greater accountability in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   He wrapped up his ''Super Tuesday'' campaigning with a
sentimental rally in a hangar at the airport in Long Beach, Calif.
''This is the last time I'm going to speak in the primary. And I'm
here to ask for your vote,'' Bush told a crowd of more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who turned the GOP race upside-down with a New Hampshire
victory and then stunned Bush in Michigan, said the voters might
deliver another surprise Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're starting to see a backlash'' against television
commercials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask Governor Bush to do what he refused to do all day
yesterday on nationwide television and tell his sleazy Texas
buddies to stop these negative attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was referring to commercials attacking his environmental
record, paid for by two Texas brothers, Sam and Charles Wyly, who
are supporters of the governor. In addition, McCain was angered by
a Bush campaign commercial, running in New York, that attacked him
as an opponent of increased breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last three days we've had the initiative,'' McCain said.
''They handed us back the reform issue'' that has been central to
his success in the earlier primaries.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley campaigned in three New York City boroughs
as well as in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   At a dusk rally in Manhattan's Bryant Park, Bradley told
hundreds of supporters, ''With your help, tomorrow New York will
send the most powerful message across this country that we want a
new politics, a new day.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sounded at times like a man who knew his days were
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've put some issues on the agenda that weren't there
before,'' he said, mentioning health care, gun control and campaign
finance. ''The Democratic Party has moved in the direction I've
pushed it over the last year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Trevor Linden scored the winning goal with just
under five minutes left as the Montreal Canadiens beat the Atlanta
Thrashers 3-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Linden, who scored just 44 seconds after setting up Eric
Weinrich's tying goal, tapped the rebound of Martin Rucinsky's shot
past Thrashers goalie Norm Maracle with 4:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   Shayne Corson also scored for the Canadiens, who had forward
Brian Savage back in the lineup after he missed 44 games with a
neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Guolla and Maxim Galanov had goals for the Thrashers, who
have lost six straight.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal has won 10 of 13 -- including three of its last four --
to move into ninth place in the Eastern Conference with 66 points,
one point ahead of Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Corson put a wrist shot past Maracle at 2:00 of the first after
he was left alone at the edge of the crease and took Saku Koivu's
pass from behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   Guolla tied it just under five minutes later, at 6:42, with his
eighth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Galanov scored an unassisted goal at 6:59 of the third to give
the Thrashers a 2-1 lead before Weinrich took a pass from Linden
and beat Maracle on a shot from the point to tie it at 2 at 14:19.
</P>
<P>
   Savage, who led Montreal with 12 goals in 21 games at the time
of the injury, suffered three broken vertebrae as the result of a
collision with the Kings' Ian Laperriere in a 5-3 win Nov. 20 at
Los Angeles. He did not have a point against the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which has won once in its last 23 games, has the NHL's
worst record at 12-47-6-4.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- David Robinson scored 25 points and Stephon
Marbury tossed up a 29-foot airball with one second left as the San
Antonio Spurs beat the New Jersey Nets 106-104 Monday night to snap
a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan added 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Spurs, while
Avery Johnson had 16 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was led by Marbury's 34 points, while Keith Van Horn
added 23.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 106-100 with 1:23 to play following a 3-pointer
by Jaren Jackson, New Jersey closed to 106-104 on consecutive field
goals by Marbury and Van Horn, the last with 37.9 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Following a San Antonio turnover with 19.9 seconds to play,
Marbury dribbled into traffic and lost control, but the ball went
out of bounds last touched by the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Marbury took the inbounds pass and pulled up
from five feet behind the 3-point line, missing by about a foot.
Robinson rebounded the airball as time expired to give the Nets
another frustrating last-second loss.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 74-69 midway through the third quarter, San
Antonio went on a 7-1 run to lead 76-75 on Robinson's dunk with
3:33 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson scored four of San Antonio's final six points in the
third quarter as the Spurs led 84-81 going into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Activated prior to the game when Steve Kerr was put on the
injured list, rookie Derrick Dial keyed a 9-4 San Antonio run with
seven points as the Spurs grabbed a 93-85 lead with 8:21 to play on
Dial's 3-pointer. Playing in his first NBA game, Dial scored nine
points in the second half.

<HEADLINE> Jets May Trade Keyshawn Johnson  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Jets are considering trading Pro
Bowl receiver Keyshawn Johnson and have talked to the Baltimore
Ravens about acquiring the fifth pick in the upcoming draft.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the talks told The Associated Press on
Monday night that the Jets want Atlanta's first-round pick, fifth
overall, which the Ravens own, plus a player or another draft pick.
The Ravens have spoken with several teams about the No. 5 choice.
</P>
<P>
   New York already owns the 16th and 18th overall choices and is
eager to deal into the top three should they obtain the fifth spot.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the No. 1 overall pick in 1996, has two years remaining
on his contract, on which he makes an average of $2.5 million a
season. That is not close to what other top receivers in the NFL
make.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Joey Galloway moved from Seattle to Dallas, he
signed a seven-year, $42 million contract. Yet Galloway's career
numbers aren't much better than Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also is concerned about the Jets' coaching situation. He
raved about playing for Bill Parcells, who resigned on Jan. 3.
Johnson was upset about the change, particularly when Bill
Belichick, Parcells' hand-chosen successor, quit and wound up with
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Al Groh now is the Jets' coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are worried about being able to re-sign Johnson, who
never has made a secret of his preference for the West Coast. A
native of Los Angeles, Johnson often has said he would enjoy
playing for the Raiders, the team he rooted for as a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson comes off his second straight Pro Bowl season. He caught
89 passes for 1,170 yards and eight touchdowns, even though No. 1
quarterback Vinny Testaverde was lost for the season in the first
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens are looking to upgrade their offense and already
signed tight end Shannon Sharpe. But they would need to clear
salary cap room to re-sign Johnson, and almost certainly wouldn't
make the trade without first reaching agreement with him on a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Stanley, Johnson's agent, did not return telephone
messages left by The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Ray Bourque Traded to Colorado  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Ray Bourque, the longtime leader of the Boston
Bruins who won five Norris Trophies but never a Stanley Cup, got
his wish for one more chance at a championship when he was traded
to the Colorado Avalanche on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We limited ourselves to teams where Raymond Bourque would have
a chance to win the Stanley Cup,'' Bruins general manager Harry
Sinden said after a 5-1 loss to Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may not be his first choice; it may be. I'm not sure. We
felt we had to do the best for the team as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old defenseman was traded along with forward Dave
Andreychuk for forward Brian Rolston, defenseman Martin Grenier,
center Sami Pahlsson and Boston's choice of a first-round pick in
either 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque took the game puck from the referee after Saturday's
loss to Philadelphia, then said goodbye to teammates and skipped
Sunday's practice. He was not at the FleetCenter on Monday night as
the Bruins closed in on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk left the building after being scratched from the
lineup, signaling that he was also part of the deal. Both he and
Bourque are expected to play for Colorado at Calgary on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this acquisition, we've brought in the greatest
defenseman of all time, and the greatest sniper in Dave Andreychuk.
We're thrilled,'' Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix said.
''With his presence and charisma, as a person he's going to bring a
lot to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado is 30-27-10 and in seventh place in the Western
Conference. With Monday's loss, Boston is 19-29-17 and essentially
out of the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were subdued during the game, yelling ''We want Raymond''
after the Senators took a 1-0 first-period lead and mixing the
chant with other jeers after Ottawa scored three goals in 100
seconds to go up 4-0 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd showed no anger towards Bourque, wishing him well
with hand-lettered signs that said, ''It won't be the same without
No. 77,'' and ''It's a sad day without Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard not to miss him when you hear the fans cheering for
him,'' Bruins defenseman Hal Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has played for the Bruins for his entire 21-year career,
and is the team's career leader in scoring and games played.
Although he had said he would rather finish his career in Boston
than win the Stanley Cup elsewhere, he changed his mind as it
became clear the Bruins would not make the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to see it as a nice thing for him to do,'' Bruins
forward Jason Allison said. ''Hopefully, he'll get a chance to do
something that everybody who plays the game wants to do. He's
certainly earned it more than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's 395 career regular-season goals places him first among
defenseman in NHL history. He is second to Paul Coffey in career
assists for a defenseman with 1,111.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he is ninth in scoring with 1,506 points and fifth in
games played, with 1,518.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bourque was unavailable for comment, he told Sinden
that he thought Colorado gave him a chance to win it all. Lacroix
said Bourque was emotional about leaving Boston, but eager to help
his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, don't worry. We'll do everything we can to do what you're
expecting of us,'' Lacroix quoted Bourque as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins drafted Bourque eighth overall in 1979, continuing
the tradition of great Bruins defensemen established by Eddie Shore
and Bobby Orr. In addition to the five Norris Trophies as the
league's top defenseman, he won the Calder Trophy as the NHL's
rookie of the year and was the MVP of the 1996 All-Star game in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But in both of his appearances in the Stanley Cup finals -- in
1988 and 1990 -- the Bruins lost to the Edmonton Oilers. Three years
ago, Bourque missed the playoffs for the first time in his career,
and he was asked if he might be interested in going elsewhere for
the championship that Boston wasn't able to give him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I will probably end up playing here, even if that
means not winning a cup or having another opportunity of winning
one,'' he said in 1997. ''... My family and myself are established
here. This is home and we enjoy being around here. So, I plan on
finishing my career in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If it ends without me winning a cup, so be it. It doesn't mean
I haven't accomplished much and I haven't had a great career. But
winning a Cup would be the ultimate. ... For us, right now, it may
not look all that rosy. But I am hopeful and optimistic things will
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Boston is poised to miss the playoffs for just the
second time since 1967, and Bourque no longer has the luxury of
looking toward the future. Although he is still a solid player, he
is no longer the superstar he once was and the massive number of
minutes is taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   He is in the last year of his contract and he has not said
whether he wants to be back for another. That means this could be
his last chance to have his name on the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was going to be retirement, or a situation like
this, it was going to be sad'' when Bourque left, Sinden said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a great, great trip for me with Ray Bourque. It's
been a great trip for everybody in this town. And I think it's been
a great trip for Ray, even without the Stanley Cup.''

Candidates Seek 'Super Tuesday' Votes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping for a Super Tuesday worthy of the name, George W.
Bush and Al Gore campaigned on opposite coasts Monday in parallel pursuit of the
victories needed to settle their parties' nominating struggles. Public opinion
polls had Gore ahead of Bradley virtually everywhere. Bush's position wasn't as
commanding, although he led McCain in the polls in several key states, including
Ohio, Maryland, Georgia, Missouri and in the winner-take-all competition for 162
California delegates.

3 Cops Convicted in Louima Coverup

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three white officers were convicted Monday of a cover-up in
the attack on a Haitian immigrant brutalized with a broken broomstick in a
stationhouse bathroom. Former patrolman Charles Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas
Wiese, 36, and Thomas Bruder, 33, were found guilty of lying to investigators to
conceal Schwarz's role in the 1997 attack on Abner Louima. Schwarz also could
get life in prison when he is sentenced for his 1999 conviction on charges of
holding down a handcuffed Louima as fellow Officer Justin Volpe sodomized him
with a broken broom handle.

Oil Boost May Not Help Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although gas prices are already almost $1.50 a gallon or
more, the government said Monday prices are likely to jump another 20 cents by
May or even higher as the summer driving season takes hold. The oil exporting
countries may boost production soon to ease the acute shortage that has seen
crude prices climb to nearly $32 a barrel, but the additional oil, even if
pumped immediately, ''would undoubtedly be too late'' to keep gasoline prices
from rising, according to a report released by the Energy Department.

   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Rep. Thomas Bliley, an ally of Virginia's tobacco
industry and chairman of the powerful committee that handles tobacco
legislation, won't seek re-election this year, sources said Monday. The
68-year-old Republican plans to announce Wednesday that he will not seek an
eleventh term, according to two sources within the GOP who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bliley has been chairman of the House Commerce Committee since 1995,
personally overseeing much of the legislation that affects the nation's tobacco
companies. Many of his constituents work at Philip Morris' Richmond cigarette
factory, the world's largest.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An electronic vandal altered the Internet site for the
Gallup Organization, one of the nation's oldest and most respected polling
companies, just before Tuesday's presidential primary elections. Gallup said
none of its poll data was compromised because its vandalized Web site, at
www.gallup.com, won't be connected to internal computers that store polling
results until Sept. 1. That's when Gallup plans to make available through its
Web site 65 years of data. Gallup results are relied upon heavily by campaigns

Prozac's Reign as Top Drug Ending
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prozac, the drug that changed the way America thinks about
mental illness and became a part of pop culture, is losing its title as the
nation's top-selling antidepressant. Demand for the little green capsules has
ebbed because of new drugs promising greater effectiveness, fewer side effects
and the ability to treat additional ailments. Introduced in 1988, Eli Lilly &AMP;
Co.'s Prozac quickly became a metaphor for society's obsession for quick fixes

100-92 for their 11th consecutive home victory. Kidd also had 10 points and fell
one rebound short of a triple-double. Tom Gugliotta added 15 points and Shawn
Marion 13. Seven players scored in double figures for the Suns, who have won 11

<HEADLINE> St. Kitts Ends Election Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By CLIVE BACCHUS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) -- The prime minister of St.
Kitts and Nevis warned of instability in the Caribbean twin-island
nation if voters handed victory to the opposition in a bitter
parliamentary election on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 34,000 residents were eligible to vote in the eastern
Caribbean nation of 48,000 people, and turnout was heavy in some
districts in an election pitting Prime Minister Denzil Douglas
against his predecessor, Kennedy Simmonds.
</P>
<P>
   The islands of St. Kitts and Nevis have an uneasy union that
barely survived an August 1998 secession referendum in Nevis, where
residents complain they don't receive their fair share of federal
spending.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's vote, Douglas's Labor Party sought to cement its
control of the 11-member National Assembly, in which it has seven
seats. Eight of the 11 seats are based in St. Kitts, and three in
the smaller island of Nevis.
</P>
<P>
   Simmonds' People's Action Movement, which governed from
1980-1995, sought to oust Labor by winning at least three seats in
St. Kitts and forming a coalition with the winners of the seats in
Nevis, where two parties are contesting the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevis, the Concerned Citizens Movement won two seats: Nevis
Premier Vance Amory was re-elected, and the CCM's Malcolm Guishard
also won. The Nevis Reformation Party's Patrice Nisbewtt claimed
the third seat. Results in St. Kitts were pending.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas warned that ''instability and confusion'' would ensue if
Simmonds' party allied with the Nevis parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nevis, which has said it would wish to have nothing to do with
St. Kitts, is going to determine that we in St. Kitts can't have
our own government of our choice, that's a lot of trouble,'' he
told supporters at a rally.
</P>
<P>
   Simmonds' campaign manager accused the premier of a bias toward
the larger island. ''St. Kitts is not the federation. It is St.
Kitts and Nevis, two islands. Dr. Douglas better understand that,''
said Constance V. Mitcham.
</P>
<P>
   Simmonds assailed Douglas' failed efforts to rejuvenate the
sugar industry and St. Kitts' $192 million debt. Douglas blamed
five hurricanes that have slammed the islands in four years for
frustrating economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party pointed to resort construction in
tourism-dependent St. Kitts, salary hikes for public servants, and
its efforts to combat crime.
