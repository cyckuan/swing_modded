9 Reported Dead in Indonesia Quake
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from a powerful earthquake that
struck in central Indonesia increased to nine Friday as remote areas began
reporting casualties, officials said. The 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 11:21 a.m.
Thursday, damaging hundreds of homes and buildings along a wide stretch of
eastern Sulawesi and the offshore islands of Peleng and Banggai, according to
the Antara news agency. Officials said the death toll would likely rise as
reports from coastal villages affected by a small tidal wave caused by the quake
begin to come in.

Officials Warn on Blood Pressure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of Americans don't have their high blood pressure
under control, and one reason is that some doctors still believe an old myth
that systolic pressure -- the top number in your reading -- isn't really
important, health officials said Thursday. Systolic hypertension is a major
underemphasized threat, particularly for older people, even if their diastolic
pressure, the bottom number, is perfectly normal, says a National Institutes of
Health advisory to physicians.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation quickly opened a
criminal investigation into the ''ILOVEYOU'' virus Thursday, while computer
security firms scurried to post software on their Web sites to scan for the bug
and remove it from infected machines. The virus targets computers running on
Microsoft's Windows operating system, attacking the Outlook e-mail program and
the Internet Explorer browser, both of which are also made by Microsoft.

Israel Retaliates for Lebanon Attack
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck at Lebanese power stations
and a guerrilla stronghold early Friday, retaliating for Hezbollah rocket
attacks on Israel that left one dead and 26 injured, witnesses and the Israeli
military said. There was no immediate word on casualties from the israeli
airstrikes. Large parts of the capital and northern and eastern Lebanon were
plunged into immediate darkness after the raids. Israel confirmed the airstrikes
and said were in retaliation for the Thursday's Katyusha rocket attacks.

Albright Warns Iran on Jews' Trial

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Iran on
Thursday that the outcome of its trial of 13 Jews on spy charges could have
international repercussions. The 13 Jews face death sentences on charges of
spying for Israel. Three have confessed, but the State Department has questioned
whether the trial conforms with worldwide standards of due process. Albright,
whose own Jewish roots became known when she was named secretary of state, said
the treatment of Jews is an accurate barometer of democracy, that where Jews are
endangered, other groups are targeted.

Poll: Livingstone New London Mayor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Exit polls show Londoners picked Ken Livingstone as their
first elected mayor. The British Broadcasting Corp. polls projected Livingstone
as the winner with 51 percent, followed by the Conservative Party's Steve
Norris. Notorious for his leftist views, Livingstone ran the capital's
metropolitan government before it was disbanded in 1986 by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government. Under his administration, the Greater London
Council had declared the city a nuclear-free zone, supported gay rights and cut
subway fares.

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Navy wasted no time Thursday in announcing
new bombing exercises on Puerto Rico's Vieques Island, which had been put on

within two weeks using dummy bombs, according to an agreement reached between
President Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello in January. Hundreds of
federal agents swept through the U.S. Navy's prized Atlantic training ground
Thursday, removing 216 protesters without serious incident to end their yearlong
occupation of the bomb-strewn range.

<HEADLINE> Asian Americans Succeed, Struggle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the
United States are generally better educated, and more likely to
fall into upper income brackets than the average American, Census
Bureau estimates show.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest data from the Census Bureau show that Asian
Americans are clustered around the lower end of the education and
income spectrum as well. For instance, 8.2 percent of Asian
Americans 25 and over in March 1999 had less than a ninth-grade
education, compared with 7.1 percent of all Americans and 4.5
percent of non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 27.6 percent of Asian Americans had at least a bachelor's
degree, compared with 18.5 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 17
percent of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   What the figures show, said Paul Ong, director of the Lewis
Center for Regional Policy Studies at UCLA, ''that the 'model
minority myth' has some basis, but it is only part of the picture.
A portion of Asian-Pacific Americans are struggling to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Asian Americans 15 and older, 12.2 percent made between
$25,000 and $34,999 in March 1999, compared with 14.1 percent of
all Americans and 14.5 percent of non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   But 16.7 percent of Asian Americans made over $50,000, as
opposed to 14.2 percent of all Americans and 16.2 percent of
non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings released Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   --A majority of Asian Americans live in the West, 53.1 percent;
19.8 percent are in the South, 17.6 percent in the Northeast and
9.5 percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   --Most live in or around metropolitan areas: only 3.7 percent
live outside a city or suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   --Asian Americans tend to live in households with more people:
46.4 percent live in a home with at least four people, compared
with 33.9 percent of all Americans and 30.5 of non-Hispanic whites.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEPORT, Calif. (AP) -- Hanging in the front office of Holy
Family Elementary School, a polished brass plaque reads: ''First
Catholic school in Lake County. Congratulations! Nov. 11, 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   But next month, Holy Family will become the first Catholic
school to close in Lake County -- victim of a sex-and-money scandal
involving the ex-bishop that left the Diocese of Santa Rosa $15
million in debt and left Northern California parishioners feeling
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to see who's paying, we're paying,'' says Tom
Lincoln, whose 9-year-old daughter will be among those without a
Catholic classroom when Holy Family shuts down.
</P>
<P>
   A new bishop, Daniel F. Walsh, was appointed in April to lead
the diocese back to fiscal and spiritual stability.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble in the diocese surfaced early last year when The Press
Democrat of Santa Rosa reported that then-Bishop G. Patrick Ziemann
had covered up the 1996 theft of church money from St. Mary of the
Angels parish in Ukiah by the Rev. Jorge Hume Salas.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Salas filed a civil lawsuit in which he alleged
the bishop had coerced him into a two-year sexual relationship in
return for keeping quiet about the theft. Ziemann abruptly
resigned, admitting the affair but claiming it was consensual. In
late April, the diocese settled with Salas for $535,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those bombshells were followed by the discovery that years of
reckless spending and hefty payouts on other sexual misconduct
cases had left the diocese $15 million in debt. Some of the money
had been lost in risky investments in the United States and
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was horrible. It was one of those situations where you
picked up the paper and saw the headlines and you said, 'This can't
be.' But it was,'' says Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unbelievable,'' agrees Monsignor John Brenkle, a St.
Helena pastor recruited to help lead the diocese out of its
financial troubles. ''Somebody said if you took our story to
Hollywood they'd throw you out.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout has buffeted parishes across the diocese, which
stretches from the lush Napa Valley to the solitary splendor of the
North Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches and schools lost their savings and special funds.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Rose parish in Santa Rosa lost about $1.9 million,
mostly money raised for a new building at the parish school. Some
had come from schoolchildren who donated their allowances.
</P>
<P>
   In Eureka, about 200 miles north of San Francisco, parents and
community leaders scrambled to raise $1.6 million to keep St.
Bernard High School open after the diocese yanked a promised
subsidy of about $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Eureka benefactors demanded that their contributions not go into
diocesan bank accounts but into a special fund under administration
of a nonprofit community organization.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners vented some of their hurt and betrayal in a series
of town meetings led by Brenkle and other members of a volunteer
financial cleanup crew this February.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've given you the broom,'' a Petaluma parishioner said at
one of the meetings. ''Get rid of the old regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kuhry, who helped form a committee at her church to deal
with the fallout, said the scandals have created a
''revolutionary'' feeling among some parishioners. ''What we would
like to put into place is a checks and balances system,'' giving
church members and parish priests more voice, along with the
bishop, Kuhry said.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese plans to launch a $600,000 fundraising campaign to
try to recoup losses. Brenkle says he'll be happy if the diocese
gets half that amount. He notes that giving is good -- and up in
some cases -- at individual parishes, something he interprets as a
sign people haven't given up on their own churches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very, very optimistic. We're still going through a
purgatory and there's still a lot of anger there but I do see that
crises mobilize people and I do see that as a diocese we are
getting mobilized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a mild April day, Lake County's first Catholic school is
alive with the shrieks and laughter of youngsters playing tag on a
grassy field that backs up into rounded hills splendid in spring
greenery.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students know they won't be coming back in
September, said the principal, Sister Judith Ann Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's sad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which started five years ago in temporary quarters
with 13 students, now has 48 attending classes in modular buildings
that were dedicated 18 months ago. The diocese has announced that
it will not make the $65,000 annual payments that Ziemann had
promised on the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents hope to keep the school going as a
nondenominational effort in another location, but others can't face
the thought of starting over.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just too overwhelming,'' said Mary Frazell, her eyes
watering as she recalled the hours of work that went into Holy
Family school.
</P>
<P>
   Though some are so angry they've left the church, most have not.
</P>
<P>
   ''This hasn't taken their faith,'' says Kuhry. ''Their faith is
not based on this hierarchical system. It's based upon a belief in
Jesus Christ and the sacraments and the community of believers.''

<HEADLINE> Director of Hurricane Center Named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Veteran hurricane tracker and storm system
forecaster Max Mayfield has been named director of the National
Hurricane Center, the National Weather Service announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, deputy director of the center in Miami since 1998, had
been acting director since January, when his predecessor, Jerry
Jarrell, retired after two years in the top position. The post
carries a salary of about $110,000 a year, according to National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA is the parent agency of both the weather service and the
hurricane center.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be fantastic, he has worlds of experience,'' said
James Lee Witt, Federal Emergency Management Agency director. ''I
think he'll continue the program and possibly strengthen it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of anybody more deserving,'' said Billy Wagner,
a county emergency management director for the Florida Keys. He
credited Mayfield with helping to create and update a hurricane
preparedness brochure for the island chain, which is vulnerable to
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   As deputy director, Mayfield shared Jarrell's role of appearing
on television to explain the storms, announce hurricane warnings
and make preparation recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   He will become more familiar to the public during the 2000
Atlantic hurricane season, which starts June 1 and runs through
Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, 51, joined the hurricane center in 1972 as an intern.
He became a hurricane specialist in 1988 and a senior hurricane
specialist two years later.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Farmers Facing Threats  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Mobs and members of Zimbabwe's ruling
party have intensified their intimidation campaign against workers
on white-owned farms, union leaders said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three days there has been a sharp increase in
threats to farmers and their workers refusing to cooperate with the
militants who have occupied more than 1,000 white-owned farms since
February, the Commercial Farmers Union said.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were no immediate reports of violence, the union
said occupiers were forcing workers to attend ruling party rallies
and threatening to destroy farm vehicles if owners refused to let
them be used to ferry people to the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the squatters have begun demanding accommodations
for ruling party officials and squatters leaders, the union said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe, facing his biggest challenge at the
polls since he led the nation to independence from Britain in 1980,
has been accused of staging the farm occupations to intimidate
farmers and other opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing his election platform Wednesday, Mugabe spoke
glowingly of the occupations and said the squatters would stay
until whites made more land available for landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers union called the recent intimidation and demands a
second phase in the occupations.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase included weeks of attacks against farmers and
their workers suspected of supporting the MDC, the biggest
opposition group contesting parliamentary elections that must be
called by August.
</P>
<P>
   At least 17 people, including farmers, farm workers and MDC
supporters have been killed in political violence in recent months.
There have been no reports of any ruling party deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa on Thursday, President Thabo Mbeki blamed
Britain and other Western donor nations for the takeovers in
neighboring Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, in a televised address to the nation, said that in 1998
he had asked British Prime Minister Tony Blair to contribute money
to end land-distribution imbalances in Zimbabwe, a former British
colony where one-third of the fertile land is still owned by about
4,000 whites. Mbeki said he also asked other countries and
organizations to contribute to the effort, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of Zimbabwe's fertile land is owned by 4,000 whites
and is inhabited by 2 million people -- workers and their families.
About 7{ million people live on the other two-thirds.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Livingstone Elected in London  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Londoners chose their first elected mayor
Thursday, with the man Prime Minister Tony Blair clumsily tried to
sideline -- political outcast Ken Livingstone -- the apparent winner,
according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. polls projected Livingstone as
the winner with 51 percent, followed by the Conservative Party's
Steve Norris.
</P>
<P>
   As he voted in his north London neighborhood on a cool, drizzly
day, the man popularly known as ''Red Ken'' for his leftist views
complained he had been the target of an ''absolutely vile campaign
from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   But, if elected, he later told the BBC, he would work with the
Blair government.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say a lot of silly things during an election campaign
and then afterwards they have to work with the reality of what
voters have done,'' said Livingstone, who was ousted from Blair's
Labor Party after he entered the race as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone ran the capital's metropolitan government before it
was disbanded in 1986 by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government. Under his administration, the Greater London Council
had declared the city a nuclear-free zone, supported gay rights and
cut subway fares.
</P>
<P>
   To Blair, Livingstone is a reminder of the Labor Party's deep
splits of the 1980s, when the left was in the ascendancy and the
party was unelectable. Today's Labor Party rose to record
popularity by hugging the middle, and Blair has referred to
Livingstone's supporters as a ''ragbag of Trotskyists and Tory
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, polls showed Livingstone with 51 percent support, so
far ahead of Norris' 17 percent that one major betting agency
stopped taking wagers. Labor's candidate, former Health Secretary
Frank Dobson, had 14 percent in those polls, just edging out
Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Across England, voters also were deciding 3,337 seats on 152
local councils, with the results serving as a barometer of public
opinion of Blair's 3-year-old government. Early returns showed the
Conservatives making gains, largely at Labor's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think martyrdom is still the most attractive party,'' said
Norris, the Tory mayoral candidate, crediting the tussle between
Livingstone and Labor with hurting Blair's party nationwide.
''Practically every decent person in the country felt some sympathy
for Ken. Labor will bear the consequences of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The London mayor will serve as an ambassador for the capital's
7.25 million residents, oversee a $5.3 billion budget and assume
responsibility for the police, transportation, fire and emergency
services, but will have only limited tax-raising powers.
</P>
<P>
   The position and a new 25-member London Assembly, also elected
Thursday, supplements a system of governance by 32 individual
boroughs and several citywide authorities. Blair created the
structure as part of his program of returning some powers to
regional and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Though most fiscal authority remains with the national
government, that has done little to allay the fears of business
leaders about a Livingstone victory. In an interview last month, he
compared international financial institutions to Adolf Hitler,
saying 15 million to 20 million people die each year in developing
countries because of the debt burden. ''But at least Hitler was
mad, you know,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure Dobson clinched the Labor nomination, Blair had
scrapped the system of a straight vote among London party members --
which Livingstone contends he would have handily won -- and created
a complicated electoral college divided into blocs of party
members, unions and Labor lawmakers and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of voters shocked, horrified and turned off
by the way the Labor Party arranged the candidate selection,'' said
Patrick Dunleavy, government professor at the London School of
Economics. ''It's nothing short of a scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy said how Blair's administration treats a potential
Mayor Livingstone could affect Labor's traditional power base, and
even sow the seeds for an alternative party.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be this sort of dance in the next year whether he's
let back in the party,'' Dunleavy said. ''The big problem for Blair
is that if he keeps Livingstone outside the Labor Party, the mayor
could become a focus of left-of-Labor sentiment.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Warns Iran on Jews' Trial  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Iran on Thursday that the outcome of its trial of 13 Jews on spy
charges could have international repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who has led U.S. calls for a new dialogue with Tehran,
said in a strong statement before the American Jewish Committee,
''If you want to earn international respect, the way to begin is by
respecting the dignity of your own citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 Jews face death sentences on charges of spying for
Israel. Three have confessed, but the State Department has
questioned whether the trial conforms with worldwide standards of
due process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governments from around the world are right in telling
officials in Iran that what happens in the trials of the 13 Jews
will have repercussions everywhere,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's overtures, which have included criticism of Iran's
human rights record, have failed to stir the government in Tehran
to accept the offer for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Albright assailed anti-Semitism as ''a recurring
curse.'' She said from the former Soviet Union to the Middle East,
from California to Central Europe, anti-Semitism persists.
</P>
<P>
   ''This demands vigilance from all who love freedom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, whose own Jewish roots became known when she was named
secretary of state, said the treatment of Jews is an accurate
barometer of democracy, that where Jews are endangered, other
groups are targeted.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright urged her audience to combat ''a new
spirit of complacency and provincialism in some quarters of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Having attacked isolationists in the past, she said this time
that ''new provincialists ask why we should still care about what
happens abroad, especially in places many of us have never been.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have to care,'' she said. ''We have been down this road
before, when too many people in too many countries cared too little
about events in hard-to-find places.''
</P>
<P>
   German President Johannes Rau, who also spoke at the dinner,
offered assurances that his country has a special relationship with
Israel and that it would remain a cornerstone of German foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware of our special responsibility for the security of
the Jewish state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Rau addressed the Israeli parliament in German,
asking forgiveness for ''what Germans have done -- for myself and my
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the American Jewish Committee's 94th annual dinner.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Brazlian First Lady Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- A federal court sentenced a former first
lady to more than 11 years in prison for corruption, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rosane Collor, wife of former President Fernando Collor de Melo,
who was voted out of office, was accused of taking kickbacks and
diverting funds to personal accounts during her tenure as the head
of the now-defunct Brazilian Assistance League, which she ran while
her husband was still president.
</P>
<P>
   She is living in Miami with her husband. Her lawyers said she
would appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''What gives me strength is the peace of mind that I did not
commit any illegal acts,'' Collor was quoted by Estado news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Collor de Melo was impeached in 1992 after being linked
to a massive scheme of kickbacks and commissions from public works
contracts. The Supreme Court then revoked his political rights
until 2000 and he went off into self-exile in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Israel Retaliates for Lebanon Attack  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes struck at Lebanese
power stations and guerrilla strongholds early Friday, retaliating
for Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel that left one dead and 26
injured, witnesses and the Israeli military said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on casualties from the Israeli
airstrikes. Large parts of the capital and northern and eastern
Lebanon were plunged into darkness after the raids.
</P>
<P>
   A military statement issued in Jerusalem said the Israeli air
force hit power transformer stations near Beirut in the central
part of the country, Tripoli in the north and a ''terrorist
target'' in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. The statement said the
attacks were in retaliation for Thursday's Katyusha rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At least two air-to-surface missiles shook northern Beirut
suburbs, where a major power station is located, witnesses said,
followed 15 minutes later by two more explosions.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, Israeli jets fired two more missiles at the
Bsaleem power station, one of three major stations supplying the
capital of 1.2 million with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese anti-aircraft guns lit up the night sky as black smoke
billowed from Bsaleem, which sits on a hill in a northern suburb of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In other attacks, Israeli warplanes attacked near the northern
port city of Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city, targeting the
power generating plant in nearby Bedew, witnesses said. Power was
cut to Tripoli and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   Jets also struck southeast of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley, a guerrilla stronghold. It was not clear what was the
intended target near the town of Brital, but witnesses said a fire
was set in a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Beirut-Damascus highway was also targeted, an
Israeli military statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes were the first near the Lebanese capital since
Feb. 8, when Israeli warplanes destroyed three power stations near
the capital.

<HEADLINE> High Court: HBO Did Not Libel Judge  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that
HBO did not libel a former Houston judge in 1992 when it broadcast
a documentary critical of his court.
</P>
<P>
   Former Judge Dean Huckabee could not prove the film's producers
knowingly broadcast false claims or showed a reckless disregard for
the truth in its film, ''Women on Trial,'' the Supreme Court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong program chronicled four cases in which family
courts granted custody to a father after the mother accused the
father of child abuse, according to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee alleged the documentary's producers portrayed him as a
judge who knowingly disregarded children's best interests. He
focused his libel allegations on how the film presented his
decision to transfer custody of 4-year-old boy from his mother to
his father, who were divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the mother alleged the father sexually abused the boy.
Investigations by Child Protective Services and the Houston Police
Department could not determine who abused him, according to
Thursday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee placed the boy in the father's custody and denied the
mother all access to the child, the ruling states. HBO portrayed
his decision as arbitrary, Huckabee claimed in court documents,
while omitting evidence that the abuse may have occurred while the
boy was with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased with the ruling and with the fact that the
court agreed there was no evidence of actual malice on the part of
HBO,'' said HBO spokesman Chris Donlay.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Huckabee nor his attorney returned telephone calls
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Blaze Magazine Folds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blaze, a hip-hop and urban lifestyle magazine,
is being shut down by its publisher, who said Thursday that the
publication fell short of its circulation and advertising goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Miller, who also publishes Spin, launched Blaze in September
1998 as a youth-oriented spinoff of Vibe, an urban lifestyle and
music magazine. The June/July issue of Blaze will be its last.
</P>
<P>
   Blaze had a circulation of 300,000 -- far below Vibe's 725,000 --
and tepid advertising revenues. In the first quarter of the year,
Blaze took in $1.7 million from advertising, down 6 percent from
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Roth, a spokesman for the publisher, said Miller would try
to find jobs for Blaze's 20 or so employees at other magazines in
the company. In addition to Vibe and Spin, Miller also publishes
Tennis, Sailing World and Cruising World.
</P>
<P>
   The downfall of Blaze was the latest closure in the magazine
industry this year. Late last month, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines
announced that it was folding Mirabella, a women's fashion title.
And in March, Conde Nast said it would suspend publication of the
men's magazine Details and relaunch it as a fashion magazine.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Utah Copter Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLANDING, Utah (AP) -- A helicopter transporting oil workers
crashed Thursday in southeastern Utah, killing three people and
injuring three others.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was traveling to oil fields near McCraken Mesa,
about 17 miles southeast of Blanding, when witnesses said the tail
section spun out of control and the aircraft fell to the ground.
The cause of the crash was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you'd seen what I'd seen, you'd know it was a miracle these
other guys got out alive,'' said San Juan County Sheriff Mike Lacy,
adding that only the tail of the helicopter remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was reported at 3:45 p.m., Lacy said. Oil field
workers in the area heard the crash and pulled the survivors from
the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The Aerostar helicopter, which can carry six passengers,
belonged to Peace Helicopters in Canada, Lacy said. It was being
leased by Denver-based Western Geophysical to do seismograph work
in the area, which is a method of finding oil by bouncing sound
waves off geologic formations.
</P>
<P>
   Two male survivors were flown to San Juan Regional Medical
Center in Farmington, N.M. One was listed in serious condition. The
other was stabilized and then flown to the University of New Mexico
Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M., where he was in critical condition
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The third survivor was also listed in critical condition
Thursday evening at San Juan Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration will examine
the wreckage Friday, Lacy said.

<HEADLINE> Violent Entertainment Debated  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hollywood moviemakers and conservative
researchers butted heads Thursday at a town hall meeting on how
violence in movies and television may influence young people.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, ''Youth Violence in America: The Reel Story,'' was
the third in a series of discussions presented by the Creative
Coalition, a social and political advocacy group composed of
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Knight, senior director of the conservative Family
Research Council, was the most vocal critic of the entertainment
industry, which he said provides children with a steady diet of sex
and violence. He cited studies linking violent entertainment with
physical changes in the brains of children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're turning our boys into kids who are insensitive to
killing, who see women as an end for their gratification,'' he told
an audience of about 200 people at the National Press Club. ''I
don't think the effect can be denied any longer, and I'm not sure
what we can do about it except to urge Hollywood to start curbing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture
Association, shot back, offering up his own studies disputing the
apparent connection between movie violence and violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollywood is a fat, inviting target, and every politician in
this country knows that if you slam, bang Hollywood, your numbers
go up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have stepped up their attacks on movies, television,
music and video games since the school shooting in Littleton,
Colo., that killed 15 people a little over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Congress have taken Hollywood to task,
suggesting that the film industry has contributed to a culture of
violence through the bloody images.
</P>
<P>
   Actor William Baldwin, who is also president of the Creative
Coalition, offered a more pragmatic approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''They call it show business for a reason, the operative word
being business,'' Baldwin said. ''The more your sons and your
daughters go to see 'Independence Day' and 'Armageddon' and they
don't go to see 'Glengarry Glen Ross' ... the more Hollywood will
make these movies.''
</P>
<P>
   During a question and answer session, Jane Walford, 35, a high
school teacher from Tekamah, Neb., told the panel that her school
has so little money the art teacher holds class in a boiler room.
While she applauded efforts by Hollywood to make anti-violent films
like ''Saving Private Ryan,'' she hoped for something more
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so much money in Hollywood, there's so much money to
be made on our kids, what can Hollywood do on a local level?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Panel moderator Linda Ellerbee, a television journalist,
responded that children need to become critical viewers who can
separate fact from fantasy. Valenti said all children should have a
morals and ethics course before they enter high school.

<HEADLINE> Quake Victims Call for Impeachment  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Victims of the 1994 Northridge earthquake
demanded Thursday that legislators impeach the state insurance
commissioner for allegedly allowing companies to avoid billions of
dollars in fines for their mishandling of disaster claims.
</P>
<P>
   People whose homes were damaged by the earthquake complained at
a news conference that the department headed by Chuck Quackenbush
did nothing while companies low-balled settlements or tied them up
in court for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has disgraced his office. He has breached his duty to the
people of California,'' said Harvey Rosenfield, a consumer advocate
who co-authored a 1988 ballot initiative that made the commissioner
an elected post.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, a Republican, set up a foundation to which six
insurers contributed $11.6 million and thus avoided possible fines
of up to $3 billion for mishandling claims from the Jan. 17, 1994,
6.7-magnitude earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has acknowledged that none of the foundation money
went to earthquake victims. Critics say at least $5 million went
for purposes that could help the commissioner politically,
including public service television ads in which he was featured.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said Thursday the accusations were brought by ''a
typical group of special interests and trial lawyers'' who had
distorted his record. ''I will not be run from office by my
political opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush defended the foundation as ''an effective,
innovative way to do many things of benefit to consumers.'' He said
a consulting firm and a proposed blue-ribbon panel led by a former
state auditor will review the foundation.

9 Reportedly Dead in Indonesia Quake

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from a powerful earthquake that
struck in central Indonesia increased to nine Friday as remote areas began
reporting casualties, officials said. The 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 11:21 a.m.
Thursday, damaging hundreds of homes and buildings along a wide stretch of
eastern Sulawesi and the offshore islands of Peleng and Banggai, according to
the Antara news agency. Officials said the death toll would likely rise as
reports from coastal villages affected by a small tidal wave caused by the quake
begin to come in.

shock and extreme respiratory distress, the letter said. Although Herceptin is
very useful, there are many drugs that could replace it, said Stanford Medical

pileup will mark the tightest alignment of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
and the moon since 1962. On May 17, the still-sunblocked planets will cluster
even closer, though the moon will have moved away by then. Star gazers must wait
two more years before another such grouping takes place, said an astronomer at

spying for Israel. Three have confessed, but the State Department has questioned
whether the trial conforms with worldwide standards of due process. Albright,

the treatment of Jews is an accurate barometer of democracy, that where Jews are

metropolitan government before it was disbanded in 1986 by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government. Under his administration, the Greater London

<HEADLINE> Tigers 8, Twins 6, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Brad Ausmus' infield single in the 11th
inning lifted the Detroit Tigers to an 8-6 victory over the
Minnesota Twins on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at second and third, Ausmus hit an RBI grounder up
the middle off Eddie Guardado that shortstop Cristian Guzman
fielded. He threw wildly to first, allowing another run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Anderson (2-0) picked up the victory with two scoreless
innings. Todd Jones pitched the 11th for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz's double off Bob Wells (0-2) put runners at second
and third with one out in the 11th. That brought on Guardado, who
struck out pinch-hitter Rob Fick brefore Ausmus' single.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus also homered off Eric Milton leading off the seventh to
break a 5-5 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki, seeking his first win since Sept. 29, 1999, also at
the Metrodome, left with a 6-5 lead after seven innings. But Jacque
Jones homered off Doug Brocail leading off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers trailed 4-2 when they rallied for three unearned runs
with two outs in the sixth, thanks to a catcher's interference
call.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley beat out an infield single and Wendell Magee
reached on Matt LeCroy's interference. Gregg Jefferies singled home
Easley, and Deivi Cruz followed with a two-run double off the glove
of Jones in left field, giving Detroit a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking's RBI double tied it at 5 in the bottom of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki gave up three straight extra base hits to start the game
and the Tigers trailed 3-0 after one inning.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman led off with a triple and scored on Hocking's double.
Matt Lawton's double drove in Hocking, and Lawton scored on David
Ortiz's fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pulled to 3-2 in the third on Juan Encarnacion's two-run
homer, his fifth, that extended his career-high hitting streak to
16 games.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half of that inning, Lawton hit a ball off the top
of the cushioned wall in left field for a double. Third-base umpire
Tim Timmons, apparently believing the ball had bounced off the
first row of seats and back onto the field, ruled it a homer.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Melvin, acting as the Detroit manager while Phil Garner
serves an eight-game suspension for his part in an April 22 brawl,
ran out to left field to argue the call, and the four-man crew
huddled near third base, then called Lawton back from the dugout to
second base.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, Ron Coomer's single drove him home for a 4-2 lead.
Notes: Tigers first baseman Tony Clark was a late scratch with a
muscle strain on his right side. He was replaced by Jefferies. ...
The Twins optioned second baseman Todd Walker, who's been shaky at
the plate and in the field, to Triple-A Salt Lake City. The Twins
brought up infielder Jay Canizaro. ... Bobby Higginson hit the roof
with a flyout in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt. To Take Custody of Boy  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Thai government will take custody of a
2-year-old boy authorities believe was used as a prop in a
smuggling scheme until his grandparents can adopt him.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's 22-year-old mother has agreed to relinquish custody of
the child, who is to be adopted by his paternal grandparents, said
Oum Maolanon, the Thai Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision will give confidence to the Thai community in
L.A. in the boy's well being once he returns home,'' he said
Thursday. ''It should reassure them that Thailand is preparing to
help the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Schiltgen, director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Los Angeles district office, confirmed the
custody arrangment but refused to discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   Ladda Benjadeja, a social worker at a Thai government agency set
up to help combat trafficking in women and children in Southeast
Asia, said the boy will be housed at a children's home until his
adoption is completed. She said his mother is not capable of caring
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since it's our policy to have every child stay with their
natural family if possible, we contacted the boy's grandparents on
his father's side. They are well-off financially and they want to
adopt their grandson,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, identified as Phanupong Khaisri, flew into Los Angeles
on April 11 under a fake name, accompanied by a man and woman
pretending to be his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors determined the Singaporean passports were phony and
the adults were neither his parents, legal guardians nor
caretakers. INS officials have said the couple apparently used the
toddler as a decoy in order to pretend they were coming to the
United States for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was to have been repatriated on Thursday, but the INS
issued a delay amid concerns by local Thai leaders that he might be
''rented'' out again as a ''human prop.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy is scheduled to leave Tuesday, said Chanchanit
Martorell, executive director of the Thai Community Development
Center, a U.S.-based advocacy group. INS officials refused to
confirm the date.
</P>
<P>
   Thai community leaders say they don't want the boy to stay in
the United States but want to ensure he returns to a ''safe
environment,'' Martorell said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's grandmother, Thong Kaewpaengchan, 60, told Thailand's
ITV television network that the boy's grandfather had raised him
since he was an infant in the poor northern province of Chiang Rai
after his father committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Thong said, her daughter came to fetch the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''She ... told me that she would give him away to be an adopted
child of her friend in exchange for 10,000 baht ($275),'' Thong
said. ''She promised to take him back to us within a week, but both
of them disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother has denied she sold or rented the boy to a smuggling
ring, saying she thought he was sightseeing with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not know about his trip to America,'' Tabtim
Kaewpaengchan told ITV. ''I only knew he was taking him out for
fun.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns Company on Cancer Drug  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government regulators are telling Celgene
Corp. to stop promoting the infamous drug thalidomide as a cancer
fighter, a use that hasn't been approved.
</P>
<P>
   In a warning letter dated April 21, the Food and Drug
Administration gave the pharmaceutical company until Friday to
cease its promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps more than for any other available drug, the need to
provide and distribute thalidomide responsibly is essential to the
public health,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide was given to pregnant women in Europe in the 1960s
to treat morning sickness. It was banned worldwide after causing
12,000 babies to be born with serious birth defects, including
flipper-like arms. The drug became available in the United States
for the first time in 1998 when the FDA approved it as a leprosy
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   When the FDA approved thalidomide, the agency told Celgene that
statements or implications that the drug could be used to treat
anything other than leprosy would violate federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Celgene, the only company that sells thalidomide in the United
States, hopes to gain federal approval to use it to treat a bone
marrow cancer that kills about 11,000 people in the United States
each year and is considered incurable with conventional
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's warning letter says the company's sales
representatives violated regulations by promoting the drug, sold
under the brand name Thalomid, to doctors for this treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Celgene has also represented to physicians that Thalomid can
be used to treat various cancers, for cancer patient 'weight loss,'
and to promote a feeling of 'general well-being' in these same
patients,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said that failure to respond to the letter could lead to
''regulatory action'' including seizures or injunctions.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Warren, N.J., could not be reached for
comment late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998 the FDA had warned the company after it had
issued press releases that were ''misleading'' because they
presented little information about the drug's risks, the letter
said. The following month, at a meeting with the company, the FDA
''expressed strong concern regarding Celgene's promotion of
unapproved uses of thalidomide.''

<HEADLINE> Initial Agreement in OSU Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State University reached a tentative
contract agreement with an employees' union Thursday that could end
a walkout that began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement with the Communications Workers of
America Local 4501 would give the 1,900 workers raises of $1 an
hour to groundskeepers, custodial workers and food service
employees, and increases of 50 cents an hour for each of the next
two years. It was not immediately clear when the increase would
take effect.
</P>
<P>
   A shift differential would be added to paychecks of after-hours
workers beginning in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The union was seeking an immediate $2-an-hour raise for the
workers, who average about $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, which began Monday, closed university cafeterias,
curtailed bus service and hampered trash collection and
housekeeping at the 48,000-student campus.
</P>
<P>
   Union President Gary Josephson said the union did not reach some
of its goals, but that remaining on strike would not accomplish
much more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll tell you this: It's a win. It's one of the best wins of
organized labor,'' Josephson said. ''There are gains for the
poorest workers ... to make a living wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Members will vote on the agreement Friday, and if they approve
it, workers will return to their jobs Saturday, Josephson said.
</P>
<P>
   The university also praised the agreement. ''We're very hopeful
that it will mark the resolution of the dispute,'' spokesman Dave
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The union's contract expired March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Some professors have held classes outdoors rather than cross the
picket lines. Others canceled classes. Because of the strike, poet
Maya Angelou and NAACP President Kweisi Mfume both canceled
appearances that had been scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Plan To Reduce Flights  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Airlines share responsibility for delays at
San Francisco International Airport, and they should help alleviate
them by consolidating shuttle flights, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is asking United and United Express, the carriers
with the most frequent service on busy West Coast routes, to use
bigger planes and to make fewer trips.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, Airport Director John Martin plans to ask the
Federal Aviation Administration for the right to order them to do
so. If granted, San Francisco would be the first airport to change
the flights offered by airlines, airport spokesman Ron Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Airline industry officials say that would be illegal, misguided
and ''a very bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The real solution to San Francisco's delays, airline and airport
officials agree, is reconfiguring the old runways, which are too
close together for flights to land simultaneously during bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   But that will take at least seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The airport wants airlines to consolidate their flights only
until the runway project is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials on Thursday released a study, which they say
backs up their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is customer service,'' Wilson said, adding
that the airport rivals New Jersey's Newark International Airport
for the nation's most flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Small planes are the ones tying up runways, Wilson said.
Turboprops carrying 30 people or fewer account for 18 percent of
the airport's 1,250 daily flights but just 3 percent of its
passengers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent bad weather conditions exacerbate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, delays typically average an hour or more
when coastal fog or rain forces the airport to close two of its
four runways. This happens a quarter of the time in a typical year,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Planes are forced to fly single-file, cutting arrivals in half,
from 60 to 30 per hour, Wilson said. ''We are not serving our
customers. The airlines are not serving our customers adequately,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials have not given airlines a deadline, but they
said they will be ready to go to the FAA in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can go to the FAA and ask for approval but there's no way
for the FAA to give it because it violates federal law,'' said
David A. Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the
trade group representing the nation's major airlines. ''The only
organization that can give that is the U.S. Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Paul Turk said he couldn't say if the FAA has the
authority. ''But we are preparing a response that will go to SFO
very shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Airline Association, which represents smaller
commuter carriers, also criticizes the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel that this is an appropriate role for an
airport,'' spokeswoman Deborah McElroy said. ''Their proposal could
disenfranchise many small communities who depend on regional
airlines for their access to San Francisco'' and the rest of the
nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   Business customers want frequent flights, said McElroy, who
worries that service to some cities could end altogether if
airlines decide it's not economical to send big planes there.

<HEADLINE> Pope Has Big Holes To Fill  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The death of New York's Cardinal John O'Connor
begins a new era for the American Catholic hierarchy and leaves
Pope John Paul II with not one but three big holes to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Connor, Cardinal James Hickey, 79, of Washington, D.C.,
and Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, 76, of Philadelphia are serving
beyond the church's normal retirement age of 75 for heads of
dioceses. Papal appointments to all three cities are long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's choices will complete a top echelon that will lead
the U.S. hierarchy for the coming decade. Catholic observers agree
New York is the most important appointment because of the city's
central role in international media and finance. O'Connor died
Wednesday at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   ''After O'Connor there's a great void'' in the U.S. hierarchy,
said Robert Moynihan, an American who edits the Rome-based Inside
the Vatican magazine. He noted that O'Connor was personally close
to the pope, visited Rome almost monthly during his heyday and sat
on the Vatican agency that names most of the world's bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of America magazine, writes in
a forthcoming column that O'Connor was unquestionably ''the most
powerful American cardinal of his generation'' and the nation's
''de facto spokesperson'' for the church.
</P>
<P>
   While leadership of the New York area's 2.4 million Catholics
has this week's headlines, Philadelphia is also traditionally an
important Catholic center and Washington is the political capital
and location for the bishops' national staff, though Catholic
membership is much smaller than in most U.S. archdioceses led by
cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Reese thinks that three U.S. cardinals stand at the forefront of
the U.S. hierarchy: Francis George, 63, of Chicago; Bernard Law,
68, of Boston; and Roger Mahony, 64, of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Law, who became an archbishop in 1984 and cardinal in 1985
alongside O'Connor, holds a seat on the Vatican bishop-selection
agency, which so enhanced O'Connor's influence. Law won points in
Rome for proposing the new universal catechism that has become a
landmark of John Paul's pontificate. Last November, U.S. bishops
elected Law as their spokesman on international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony has led the nation's largest archdiocese for 15 years.
George, the newcomer among the three, heads the second-ranking U.S.
archdiocese, and Moynihan thinks he ''is emerging as the Vatican's
American interlocutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. cardinals include William Keeler, 69, of Baltimore
and Adam Maida, 70, of Detroit. Archbishop Justin Rigali, 65, could
become a cardinal, as did several of his predecessors in St. Louis.
Three other cardinals who formerly ran U.S. archdioceses now work
at the Vatican: William Baum, James Stafford and Edmund Szoka.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable speculation about why John Paul has
delayed these major appointments. Moynihan discounted suggestions
that the aging pope is waning in energy: ''Rather than decelerating
as he turns 80 this month, he is accelerating his activity.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul is not a ''nuts and bolts'' pontiff and Rome generally
has trouble finding candidates it likes among priests trained since
1965, Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That generation produced a bunch of wonderful people but in
terms of material for bishops it's soft timber,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said it was possible ''that once the pope himself turned
75 it became more difficult for him to insist that these people
retire at 75. Clearly, Cardinal O'Connor wasn't interested.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the most likely explanation for delay relates to the
worldwide church celebration of the year 2000: ''He simply wanted
to have all his old friends around during the jubilee and would
make the changes afterward.''

<HEADLINE> Vieques Training Can Resume  </HEADLINE>
By DAN PERRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Its prized Atlantic base cleared of
protesters, the U.S. Navy can temporarily resume the bombing
exercises it considers critical to national defense.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying the dispute over Puerto Rico's Vieques Island is
the unresolved issue of Puerto Rico's unusual ties to the United
States. While most Puerto Ricans cherish their U.S. citizenship,
they bask in a nationalism that turned a single fatality in Vieques
last year into a major national security headache.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of federal agents reclaimed the Vieques base in a dawn
sweep Thursday, removing 216 protesters who had occupied the
bomb-strewn range. The Navy then announced new bombing exercises,
which the protests had put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   However, many questions remain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Will Puerto Ricans accept resumed bombings, which the Pentagon
says could come in two weeks? On Thursday, hundreds demonstrated
outside a U.S. Army base in San Juan, there was a mass candlelight
vigil in the Old Town, and more protests are expected. ''Obviously
the fight isn't over,'' said Independence Party leader Ruben
Berrios.
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the Navy succeed in repairing relations with Vieques'
9,400 inhabitants? If not, residents probably will vote in a
planned binding referendum to expel the Navy by 2003. Few here
believe the military's claims that only on Vieques can the Atlantic
Fleet achieve preparedness for bombing and amphibious operations.
</P>
<P>
   -- If the Navy eventually leaves Vieques, will it scale down its
presence in Puerto Rico? Officials suggest that without Vieques
training to oversee they may shut down the 8,600-acre Roosevelt
Roads compound -- one of the largest Navy bases, employing 2,500
civilians and injecting more than $300 million into the area's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Will there be a Hispanic backlash in the United States after
the operation, so soon after the controversial raid on the Miami
family of Elian Gonzalez? Officials took pains Thursday to apply
the lessons learned there, carrying out a kinder, gentler action in
which dialogue was preferred to force. And -- in the best tradition
of civil disobedience -- protesters were as eager to avoid violence.
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the Clinton administration or its successor have the
stomach for prolonged political battle over Vieques on the
mainland? Support for the Vieques cause came this week from the
U.S. National Council of Churches, the Geneva-based World Council
of Churches, the Pastors for Peace human rights group from Chicago,
newspaper editorials, Hillary Rodham Clinton and U.S. Congress
members.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques ''unites Puerto Ricans not only in Puerto Rico but
throughout the 50 states,'' said U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y.,
who was arrested Thursday at a protest in front of the White House.
''It would definitely become a campaign issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano said a raid on Vieques should put Puerto Rico's status
on the U.S. political agenda. ''Look at the Cuban issue. You have
two Florida senators demanding hearings'' into the Elian Gonzalez
raid, he said. ''If Puerto Rico was a state, it would have two
senators filibustering over Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has only a single non-voting delegate.
</P>
<P>
   And many here and on the mainland believe this is as it should
remain -- because after 102 years of U.S. rule, 83 years of U.S.
citizenship and about half a century of the system called
''commonwealth,'' Puerto Ricans insist they comprise a distinct
Latin American nation.
</P>
<P>
   This feeling grows stronger even as once-poor Puerto Rico
becomes ever more outwardly similar to the United States -- with
highways and megamalls, fast food chains and first-run U.S. movies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, local pride has been stoked by the broad
successes of Puerto Ricans, both those born locally and on the
mainland. That success is celebrated here more as an export than as
a sign of integration.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Ricky Martin -- a booster of the Vieques cause -- asserted
recently that Puerto Rico was its own country and that even after
spending years in New York and Miami, ''I never felt American.''
</P>
<P>
   Under commonwealth, it's an open question how many Puerto Ricans
do. The 4 million islanders cannot vote for president, a minority
speak English fluently and symbols of separateness like the Puerto
Rican flag, anthem, Olympic team and Miss Universe entry are
adored.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, few conceive of giving up their U.S.
citizenship, which allows them open access to the mainland, where
millions of relatives live and where jobs are available. Washington
also sends down about $13 billion a year, a figure that is nearly a
third of the island's official gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been great indecision: a 1998 referendum on
status was won by a ''none of the above'' option advocated by
supporters of the status quo. U.S. statehood won 46 percent and
independence 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican nationalism seemed to be driving much of the
protest that erupted after a civilian guard was killed by stray
bombs on Vieques 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios and other independence activists who spearheaded the
movement have received tremendously sympathetic coverage, and
demonstrations by tens of thousands for Vieques took on
anti-American airs.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Handcuffed but unbowed, Puerto
Rico's Independence Party leader says he may return to the
contested U.S. Navy bombing range on Vieques Island from which
federal agents removed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the fight isn't over,'' said the white-bearded
Berrios, 60, who came home Thursday to a hero's welcome in San
Juan, where supporters cheered and whistled. ''When and how we will
return is something we can't say right now -- but we will return.''
</P>
<P>
   Others took up that refrain, despite the tight security now in
place around the base perimeter and the warnings that next time
they'd face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can bet that we're going back,'' freed protester Rega
Miro, 26, said when he returned by ferry to Vieques. ''Because of
what we've done, every day the movement will grow stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan, hundreds of people swarmed to the Old Town's
historic El Moro fortress for a rally and candlelight vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they go back in (to the range), I'm going with them,''
declared 56-year-old Ismeralda Vades.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios was the only protester never to leave the Vieques
bombing range that demonstrators invaded shortly after stray bombs
killed a civilian security guard in April 1999. His distinguished
features became the face most associated with the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios ran his beachfront tented camp with strict discipline,
allowing no alcohol and ensuring the beachfront was combed daily,
as if at a tony resort.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, his camp was outfitted with some comforts, including
a generator, television, radio and cellular telephones and even a
small cabin for the leader. Berrios also kept in touch with the
outside through mail and newspapers delivered by fishermen, who
supplied the camp with food and water.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he resigned the local Senate seat he had held for
16 years, saying he did not want to deprive his party of its sole
seat because he wanted to remain on the beach and concentrate on
the fight to eject the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A law professor educated at Oxford and Yale, Berrios took part
in a similar civil disobedience campaign on Vieques' sister island
of Culebra, and was jailed briefly for his actions there in 1973.
The protest helped prompt the Navy to leave Culebra in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The gubernatorial candidate had vowed to campaign from prison if
necessary -- but he and others were released after their removal
from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his popularity, Berrios and his party generally receive
only around 5 percent of the vote at most -- a reflection of Puerto
Ricans' hesitation to sever their ties to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Cartel Lieutenant Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- He is described as the ''second-in-command''
for one of the most violent drug cartels in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest Wednesday of Ismael Higuera Guerrero after a
shootout in Baja California marks the beginning of the end for the
Arellano-Felix drug cartel, Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This criminal organization has been put on the run. We are
dismantling them,'' prosecutor Mariano Herran Salvatti told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration called the arrest ''a
major victory for both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement,'' and
called Higuera Guerrero ''the most visible member'' of the gang,
after brothers Ramon and Benjamin Arellano Felix dropped out of
sight to avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police and soldiers arrested Higuera Guerrero, his
15-year-old son, five other men and two Colombian women based on a
tip they received from an anonymous telephone caller.
</P>
<P>
   The agents went to the house on a highway between Tijuana and
Ensenada where they were told the drug lord was hiding. When they
got there, they were greeted by gunfire from the house. Surrounded,
Higuera Guerrero and the others later surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Higuera Guerrero was charged in the 1993 murder of a police
commander who had tried to arrest him, and for drug trafficking.
Prosecutors are weighing additional charges of attempting to bribe
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   He was transferred to the maximum security Almoloya prison just
west of Mexico City. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 40
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican prosecutors have said in the past that the Arellano
Felix brothers frequently operated in the United States as well as
Mexico, and all four vehicles seized in Thursday's raid had
California license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Herran Salvatti did not say where police believe the brothers
are now, but promised an arrest soon.

<HEADLINE> Air Bag Safety Rule Changes Sought  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is proposing sweeping changes
in auto air bag safety rules to better protect young children and
small women.
</P>
<P>
	   Under new rules to be announced Friday by Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater, automakers would be required tests using
an entire ''family'' of auto dummies, including 1-, 3- and
6-year-old children and a small woman, as well as an average size
man currently required.
</P>
<P>
	   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials said
the regulations attempt to recreate real-world conditions by
specifying that child dummies be placed in child seats on the
passenger seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and
lying positions.
</P>
<P>
	   The standard allows for a lower speed crash test, which the auto
industry said will protect smaller passengers who can be killed
when the bag inflates at low speeds. Since 1990, air bags have
killed 158 children and small adults, mostly at slower speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   Some consumer groups wanted a 30 mph standard that would result
in more powerful air bags, which they say could be combined with
advanced technology to stop them from inflating at lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   From Sept. 1, 2003, to Aug. 31, 2006, increasing percentages of
motor vehicles will be required to meet requirements for reducing
air bag risks, either by automatically turning off the air bag in
the presence of young children or deploying the air bag in a manner
much less likely to cause serious or fatal injury, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a second stage phase-in from Sept. 1, 2007, to Aug. 31,
2010, the maximum test speed for unbelted average-size dummies will
increase from 30 mph to 35 mph in tests for increasing percentages
of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   The department's interim final rule could change after a period
of public comment and reaction to the slower speed test.

<HEADLINE> Annan Seeks Release of Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan is rounding
up African leaders to exert pressure on Sierra Leone rebels to
release at least 92 U.N. peacekeepers and civilians they have taken
hostage over several days of clashes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Annan said Thursday the United Nations was
seeking to mobilize a rapid-reaction force to move into Sierra
Leone to reinforce the 8,700-member U.N. mission that has come
under attack by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and France have been approached, but
so far none have committed any troops or logistical help, Annan
said. Britain and the United States both ruled out any ground
troops on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ideally one would want to see a rapid-reaction force go in to
assist,'' Annan said. ''But this can only happen if those with
capacity are prepared to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. peacekeeping force for Sierra Leone was dispatched in
January to oversee a cease-fire and peace agreement to end an
eight-year civil war in which the rebels killed thousands and
tortured and maimed tens of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, RUF rebels began seizing U.N. staff in three
towns -- Makeni and Magburaka in central Sierra Leone and Kailahun
in the east -- just as a Nigerian-led regional intervention force
was pulling its last troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The initial clashes began after the United Nations refused to
hand over 10 rebel fighters who had come to a U.N. disarmament
center to turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Foday Sankoh denied Thursday that his troops were
holding any U.N. hostages. Sankoh's spokesman, Eldred Collins,
accused the United Nations of forcibly disarming rebel fighters.
U.N. officials denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations on Thursday scaled down its estimated death
toll of seven peacekeepers killed to four missing and presumed
dead, spokeswoman Marie Okabe said. They were believed to be from
the Kenyan battalion.
</P>
<P>
   At least 92 U.N. peacekeepers, unarmed observers and civilians
have been detained since Monday, including a 23-man contingent of
Indian peacekeepers that was surrounded Thursday by RUF rebels in
Kuiva, near Kailahun, Okabe said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission also lost contact with other units, she said,
including a 200-plus Zambian contingent in the northwestern town of
Kambia that was heading to reinforce troops in the Makeni-Magburaka
region.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that the numbers were fluctuating because of the
changing situation.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he had spoken with the leaders of Nigeria, Mali,
Liberia, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Togo and Libya, hoping they could
use their influence with Sankoh to persuade him to call an end to
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Several sent envoys, including the Nigerian national security
adviser and Mali's foreign minister, and Mali was considering
convening a summit of regional leaders as chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to impress upon him the seriousness of the
situation and the fact that he's placing himself in a very
difficult situation,'' Annan said. ''He's already isolated and it's
going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All the leaders are giving him the same messages,'' he said.
''If they thought he did not hold the hostages, they would not be
acting that way with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council again condemned the attacks on the U.N.
mission, demanding that the RUF release all the detainees and
resume cooperation with implementing the cease-fire agreement
signed in Lome, Togo, last July.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Security Council considers Mr. Foday Sankoh, as leader of
the RUF, to be responsible for these actions, which are
unacceptable and in clear violation of their obligations under the
Lome Agreement,'' said a statement adopted Thursday by the council.
</P>
<P>
   ''The council believes he must be held accountable, together
with the perpetrators, for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The council said it would consider further actions ''as
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he was encouraging countries providing troops to the
U.N. mission to expedite deployment of a final three battalions to
get the force up to its authorized strength of 11,100. Those troops
had been scheduled to arrive in mid-June.

<HEADLINE> U.N Peacekeepers Blamed for Clashes  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's feared former
rebels are blaming U.N. peacekeepers for clashes in which an
estimated 92 U.N. workers were captured, many more were missing and
at least four are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Revolutionary United Front claimed Thursday that
peacekeepers were forcibly disarming RUF fighters -- a charge U.N.
officials denied. Six rebels were killed in the clashes, said RUF
spokesman Eldred Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says the former rebels, who are now part of a
power-sharing government, have seized at least 92 U.N staff,
including unarmed military observers, armed peacekeepers and
civilian personnel, said U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was rounding up African leaders to
exert pressure on the rebels to release the hostages and said the
United Nations was seeking to mobilize a rapid-reaction force to
move into Sierra Leone to reinforce the 8,700-member U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their detention is unlawful,'' U.N. spokesman Philip Winslow
said in Freetown, noting that the general amnesty included in a
shaky July peace accord does not extend to crimes committed after
the deal was signed. ''The people who have done this will be held
accountable for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-man unit of an armed Indian battalion was reported to be
surrounded Thursday by RUF rebels in Kuiva, near Kailahun, in
eastern Sierra Leone, Okabe said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission had lost contact with some of its units,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who pledged Wednesday to ''release
any hostages if held,'' continued Thursday to deny that the RUF had
seized any U.N. workers at all.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents began Monday as the Nigerian-led West African
intervention force that had helped bring an end to Sierra Leone's
eight-year civil war prepared for its final departure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   RUF rebels began seizing U.N. staff in the towns of Makeni and
Magburaka in central Sierra Leone and Kailahun in the east after
the United Nations refused to hand over 10 rebel fighters who had
come to a U.N. disarmament center to turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcements have been sent to U.N. positions that have come
under rebel attack, and security has been stepped up in this
seaside capital, where U.N. soldiers staffed checkpoints and
helicopters hovered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials initially reported seven peacekeepers died, but
revised the estimated death toll Thursday to four missing and
presumed dead. They were believed to be from the Kenyan battalion.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi said the death of Kenyan
peacekeepers was ''of great concern and deep sorrow to him'' and
called on the United Nations to ensure the safety of peacekeeping
forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops remained on the alert Thursday, but no fighting was
reported. Negotiations to secure the captives' release continued
with the assistance of the Nigerian national security adviser, the
Malian foreign minister and other envoys.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. forces were allowed to deliver food for the hostages in
Kailahun, but U.N. officials have had no direct contact with them.

9 Dead in Indonesia Quake

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from a powerful earthquake that
struck in central Indonesia increased to nine Friday as remote areas began
reporting casualties, officials said. The 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 11:21 a.m.
Thursday, damaging hundreds of homes and buildings along a wide stretch of
eastern Sulawesi and the offshore islands of Peleng and Banggai, according to
the Antara news agency. Officials said the death toll would likely rise as
reports from coastal villages affected by a small tidal wave caused by the quake
begin to come in.

FDA Warns Company on Cancer Drug

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government regulators are telling Celgene Corp. to stop
promoting the infamous drug thalidomide as a cancer fighter, a use that hasn't
been approved. In a warning letter dated April 21, the Food and Drug
Administration gave the pharmaceutical company until Friday to cease its
promotions. Thalidomide was given to pregnant women in Europe in the 1960s to
treat morning sickness. It was banned worldwide after causing 12,000 babies to
be born with serious birth defects, including flipper-like arms. The drug became
available in the United States for the first time in 1998 when the FDA approved
it as a leprosy treatment.

pileup will mark the tightest alignment of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
and the moon since 1962. On May 17, the still-sunblocked planets will cluster
even closer, though the moon will have moved away by then. Star gazers must wait

<HEADLINE> Judge Ruling on Tripp Case  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp, facing trial this summer
on criminal wiretapping charges, could see her legal troubles
eased, or even erased by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Howard County Circuit Judge Diane Leasure said she expects to
rule by this afternoon whether to exclude or limit evidence in the
case -- including testimony from the prosecution's star witness,
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky -- or dismiss the charges
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   She could also allow the July trial to proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury indicted Tripp on July 30 on two counts of breaking
the state's wiretapping law.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege Tripp illegally recorded a conversation with
Lewinsky on Dec. 22, 1997, and disclosed the contents to Newsweek
magazine a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, recorded from the living room of Tripp's Columbia
home, triggered Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation
into Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland law prohibits intercepting telephone conversations
without both parties' consent. Prosecutors believe Tripp's secret
recording of her own conversations with Lewinsky constituted
interception.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Tripp could face 10 years in prison and a $20,000
fine. She is the only major figure in the Clinton sex scandal to
face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp received a federal grant of immunity from prosecution, but
that didn't stop Maryland authorities from bringing a case against
her. Maryland prosecutors were forced, however, to gather their own
evidence, independent of anything Tripp provided to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued the judge should dismiss the case
because it was tainted by evidence from the Starr investigation.
They say Lewinsky's testimony was partially derived from Tripp's
immunized testimony, and that prosecutors made no attempt to shield
the Maryland grand jurors from news of the Starr Report.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified last December that she independently recalled
the date of the crucial telephone conversation Tripp is charged
with illegally taping. But Lewinsky told prosecutors in writing in
August 1998 that the information came from Tripp's immunized
statements to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp attorneys contend Lewinsky changed her testimony to help
prosecutors and to seek revenge against Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony is considered crucial because she
established that Tripp made the tapes without her consent.

<HEADLINE> Reports: 17 Dead in Indonesia Quake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from a powerful
earthquake that struck in central Indonesia increased to 17 Friday
as remote areas began reporting casualties, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 11:21 a.m. Thursday, damaging
hundreds of homes and buildings along a wide stretch of eastern
Sulawesi and the offshore islands of Peleng and Banggai.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. La Sande, an officer at the military station in Luwuk, a
town on the eastern coast of central Sulawesi, said the death toll
has reached 17 by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected to rise because coastal villages struck by a
small tsunami tidal wave that followed the earthquake had not yet
reported due to communications problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sande said paramedics with medicines and other supplies were on
the way to remote islands.
</P>
<P>
   Sevatius Suyitno, chief of the Geophysics Agency in Luwuk said
80 percent of the buildings on Banggai were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Banggai area -- located about 1,100 miles
northeast of Jakarta -- was hit by a 6.0-magnitude earthquake.
Dozens of buildings were damaged or destroyed but no lives were
lost.
</P>
<P>
   A quake with a magnitude of 6.0 can cause severe damage if
centered in a heavily populated area.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation, is prone to
the seismic upheaval because of its location on the so-called
Pacific ''Ring of Fire'' -- a line of volcanically active areas
stretching from the western coast of the Americas across to Japan,
Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Speculation centers on Connecticut bishop to succeed O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As Roman Catholic officials began the
complicated process of choosing a new cardinal for the New York
Archdiocese, educated guesses focused on a 68-year-old Connecticut
bishop with ties to Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., now leads a
flock less than a sixth the size of that headed by Cardinal John
O'Connor. But a day after O'Connor's death, Egan's experience at
the Vatican and as a church official in New York appeared to make
him a likely candidate Thursday for the job at St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Another man who also is considered a candidate, Archbishop
Theodore McCarrick of Newark, N.J. -- and who has just returned from
Rome -- said the decision on a successor has already been made. But
he wouldn't say who the choice was.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know who the final candidate will be .... We'll all be
delighted with the choice,'' said McCarrick as he arrived in Newark
after his three-day Rome visit during which he spoke with the pope.
</P>
<P>
   McCarrick said he would not be the one named New York's
cardinal, which is the nation's most influential Catholic post. He
had high praise for Egan, calling him a strong administrator who
had done good things in Bridgeport, where he has been bishop since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's name has also been mentioned as a likely successor by
priests at Masses around the city. Bishop Patrick Ahern told
parishioners at the Church of St. Thomas More in Manhattan on
Thursday that he was certain Egan would be named to replace the
O'Connor, who died Wednesday at 80 of brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had no official knowledge, Ahern said, ''It's the
constant rumor and I have no difficulty in accepting it because
it's a very appropriate appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll do a good job,'' said Ahern, a former aide to O'Connor
who knows Egan. ''He's a strong man, a smart man. He's very able.
He's from the Chicago area, so he's already a big-city fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Archdiocese spokesman Joe Zwilling refused to comment
on reports that Egan had already been chosen, as did the spokesman
for the Bridgeport diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said Bishop Robert Brucato had been appointed by Rome
to be the day-to-day administrator of the diocese until a successor
is named. Brucato has been serving as a vicar general, or top
assistant to the cardinal, since August.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we acknowledge that speculation is rampant, however,
we are not in a position to say anything on the matter,'' said
Bridgeport diocese spokesman Tom Drohan. But he added, ''You can be
sure we are proud of the record of accomplishment that Bishop Egan
has written in the diocese.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who was born in Oak Park, Ill., just outside Chicago, is
head of a diocese with 367,000 Roman Catholics in 88 parishes. He
is credited with regionalizing the Catholic school system and
establishing the diocese's Inner City Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He served in Rome for 18 years and was an auxiliary bishop in
New York, chosen by O'Connor to oversee the archdiocese's education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   His name is one of about a dozen mentioned as possible
successors. Among the others were several with strong New York
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Henry Mansell, 62, a bishop in Buffalo since 1995, was
born in the Bronx and educated in local Catholic schools. He also
was an auxiliary bishop in New York and a former top aide to
O'Connor. Mansell, however, told reporters he would like to stay in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, 60, was also born in the Bronx and is
the product of parochial schools. Like O'Connor, who was a military
chaplain, O'Brien has a military background. He was a priest at the
Military Academy at West Point before joining the Army in 1970 and
has been archbishop for the Catholic Archdiocese for the U.S.
Military since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   While speculations grew, one expert in Catholic hierarchy said
he couldn't understand why any of those mentioned would want the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who wants to be head of the Archdiocese of New York
should have his head examined,'' said Thomas Reese, editor of the
Jesuit magazine America. ''It's a very difficult job. You're in the
public limelight all the time, everyone is always telling you how
to do the job. You work grueling hours, sometimes 70 hours a week.
There's an incredible number of constituents to please, to say
nothing of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese said he also heard Egan was a top candidate but said he
has heard so many names mentioned over the past nine months that he
no longer takes any of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''All it means is that Bishop Egan has joined the rumor of the
week club,'' he said. ''The fact is, this is a highly secretive
process and those who know don't talk and those who don't know
spread rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for the pope to name a successor. Many
believe there will be no announcement until after O'Connor's
funeral Monday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins with recommendations in the United States,
then goes to a committee in the Vatican which makes
recommendations. The pope can follow the recommendation or reject
the candidate and call forth another.

<HEADLINE> Americans Take Over Cinco De Mayo  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- In Mexican history, today's Cinco de Mayo
holiday commemorates an 1862 victory by a small army of Mexican
patriots and peasants over stronger French forces.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from sober battle re-enactments and political
pronouncements, Cinco de Mayo is hardly a holiday in Mexico,
leaving many immigrants scratching their heads over the growing
popularity of the day across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Mexicans first come to the United States and somebody
mentions that they're all excited about some Cinco de Mayo
festival, they say 'What?','' said Carlos E. Garcia, president of a
consumer marketing firm in Burbank. ''It would be like Canadians
making a big deal out of the Boston tea party.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinco de Mayo is not Mexican Independence Day -- a common
misconception among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Cinco de Mayo has evolved into a major event in
Hispanic-heavy communities in large part for two reasons: a push by
Chicano activists who wanted a Mexican cultural event celebrated in
schools, and marketers who saw an opportunity to capitalize on
Mexico's reputation for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a non-event made into a big deal by marketing,'' said
Garcia, who operates Garcia Research Associates, which targets U.S.
Hispanic consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The selling of the holiday will help double margarita sales at
an El Torito Mexican restaurant in San Diego, where General Manager
Jacob Rivera is organizing a tortilla toss -- a chance to win free
meals by lobbing a corn tortilla into a sombrero.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who can't recall celebrating Cinco de Mayo during his
childhood in Tijuana, is good-natured about the party. He sees it
as a chance to tell his mostly non-Mexican patrons a bit about
history -- even if it's only to explain that Mexican Independence
Day really falls on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   With its fun-spirited reputation, Cinco de Mayo has become a
sort of Latin St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The two days are marketed in much the same way by Ralphs Grocery
Co., which operates 450 supermarkets across California. Sales of
corned beef and cabbage one month, then chips, salsa and margarita
mix in another, said company spokesman Terry O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   It's a day popular across ethnic lines, he said, ''like St.
Patrick's Day, on that day, everybody is Irish: On Cinco de Mayo,
everybody is Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinco de Mayo also is the biggest day of the year for avocados.
Americans will eat 17 million pounds of the green fruit -- or 34
million avocados, mostly in the form of guacamole, according to the
California Avocado Commission. Super Bowl Sunday comes in second to
May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Sales also will jump for Jose Cuervo, the world's top-selling
tequila, said Steve Goldstein of UDV North America, the brand's
importers and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has promotions planned across the country, including
a ''Tijuana Taxi'' to bars and restaurants in the Los Angeles area,
a T-shirt giveaway in New York and the dropping of a ''margarita
bar'' billed as the ''Sink-O de Mayo'' into waters off Miami's
South Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While some Latinos feel Mexican culture warrants a holiday that
promotes history more than hangovers, many applaud the day for
being merry.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Gisela Butler, a Chicano history professor at San Diego
State University, said she used to ask students to list five things
they knew about Mexico. Common responses were tacos, graffiti,
crime or drugs -- ''anything that was negative. This is what they
associated with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinco de Mayo may promote superficial concepts of Mexico, she
said, ''but at least it's something positive.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Warn on Blood Pressure  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many doctors are failing to adequately treat
patients with high blood pressure because they still believe the
top number in a person's blood pressure reading is less important
than the lower figure, the National Institutes of Health says.
</P>
<P>
   In an advisory to physicians Thursday, the federal health
officials said a high systolic reading is a major underemphasized
threat, particularly for older people, even if their diastolic
pressure, the bottom number, is normal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, many physicians have not yet ... become
aggressive in treating such patients,'' said Dr. Daniel Levy,
director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's massive
Framingham Heart Study and co-author of the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50 million Americans have high blood pressure,
often called the ''silent killer'' because it may not cause
symptoms until the patient has suffered serious damage. It raises
the risk of heart attacks, strokes, congestive heart failure,
kidney damage, blindness and dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Blood pressure is measured as two values. Systolic, the first or
top number, is the pressure inside arteries when the heart beats.
Diastolic, the last number, is the pressure between beats when the
heart relaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ideal blood pressure is 120 over 80, or lower.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure is above 140 over 90.
</P>
<P>
   But even if your bottom number is normal or low, you need to get
your systolic pressure below 140, said Dr. Daniel W. Jones of the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-fourth of hypertension sufferers have their condition
adequately controlled. Inadequate control of systolic pressure is
the biggest problem, says the NIH advisory, which updates previous
federal hypertension guidelines and marks the start of an
Internet-run education campaign for doctors and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The address: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Millions don't know they have high blood pressure. Others don't
properly take their daily medication.
</P>
<P>
   But another reason: For decades, doctors thought diastolic
pressure was the only important measurement, and that it was normal
for systolic pressure to rise as people aged, said Jones,
hypertension chief at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists know that's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Younger people may have hypertension where just the bottom
number, the diastolic pressure, is too high -- and that is a disease
that needs treating.
</P>
<P>
   But usually both numbers rise or -- most common after age 60 --
just the systolic pressure is high while the diastolic is normal or
even falls, says Thursday's advisory by the NIH heart institute.
</P>
<P>
   So if your pressure is, say, 170 over 70, that's called
''isolated systolic hypertension'' and it needs treatment, Levy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent study, patients properly treated for isolated
systolic hypertension cut their risk of heart failure by more than
50 percent and the risk of stroke and heart attacks by a third.
''That's a pretty dramatic lowering of risk,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: Say your pressure is 160 over 100, and a first
attempt at medication drops it to 148 over 86. Sometimes doctors
figure the bottom number is low enough to stop treatment, but ''you
need to press on until you get the systolic to less than 140,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people need even more stringent blood pressure control. The
NIH advisory recommends that diabetics, who already are at risk for
heart disease, keep blood pressure below 130 over 85.
</P>
<P>
   Hypertension treatment is the same regardless of whether the
problem is systolic or diastolic or both. Diet and exercise may be
enough for some people. Others may need one or more medications.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Let Women Serve in Submarines  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is coming under increasing pressure
to end its 100-year ban on women serving aboard submarines, a
prohibition that critics say unfairly limits the career choices of
female sailors.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon civilian advisory panel has recommended that the Navy
put women officers aboard Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines --
the largest subs in the service -- and redesign the Virginia-class
attack submarines now in development so that women can serve aboard
those smaller, state-of-the-art subs.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine service, which this year marked its centennial, is
one of the last areas of the military to exclude women.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy argues there is too little room on submarines to
accommodate women's privacy needs, although it has permitted women
to serve aboard most combat ships -- including aircraft carriers --
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The only other areas off limits to women are front-line combat
positions in the Army, such as tank and artillery crews.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services voted on
Sunday to recommend that the Navy begin by assigning women officers
to the Ohio-class subs. It did not recommend including female
enlisted sailors.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the Navy should redesign its smaller
Virginia-class attack submarines to accommodate coed crews, the
panel said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The submarine service is an elite, prestigious force that
requires the brightest and best-qualified work force,'' the panel
wrote in its recommendation to Navy Secretary Richard Danzig and
Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval operations. ''Navy women are
highly capable and competitive and would volunteer for submarine
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel members, who are appointed by the secretary of defense
to provide advice on issues related to women's role in the
military, made their recommendations after a two-year study and
consultation with the Navy on its objections to ending the
traditional ban on women serving aboard submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the Navy needs to open this up,'' Vickie McCall,
chairman of the advisory panel, said in a telephone interview.
''There are women who would really like to be on a submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said Thursday that he welcomed the panel's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The logical next step is to encourage the submarine community
to -- as dispassionately as possible -- evaluate both parts of that
and talk about it,'' Danzig said in a brief interview. Many defense
officials believe it is unlikely the Navy will take any action on
this politically sensitive issue before next year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Danzig caused a stir in the Navy by telling the Naval
Submarine League that it was time they come to grips with the need
to include women in their midst and to broaden opportunities for
minority sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the submarine force remains a white male bastion, it will
wind up getting less and less support when it requires resources,
when it has troubles -- be they accidents or personnel issues or
other kinds of things,'' Danzig said then. ''It will find itself
more and more starved in its recruiting and more and more undercut
in terms of the support it achieves for its missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has opposed including women on submarine crews, mainly
on grounds that it would be impractical to meet both men's and
women's privacy needs. Johnson's spokesman, Capt. Jim Kudla, said
Thursday that Johnson had not changed his view. ''We currently have
no plan to change our policy,'' Kudla said.
</P>
<P>
   In its report to Danzig and Johnson, the advisory panel
acknowledged the Navy's concern about privacy and the cost of
retrofitting submarines to accommodate female crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, the Navy's historical experience and commitment to
the utilization of women on other (vessels) provides a model for
change,'' the panel said. ''Drawing on these experiences will
better enable the Navy to overcome obstacles it perceives as
prohibiting integration of women into the submarine service.''

<HEADLINE> Neighbors unaware of plan to put landfill next door  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- William Dunn has operated his country
restaurant for more than three decades. The last thing he wants
next store is a 550-acre dump.
</P>
<P>
   But that prospect is exactly what he's suddenly facing. Mayor
Joe Griffo has formed a committee of city officials to review an
offer by a trash hauler to ship New York City garbage upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbrier Management Corp. of Albany wants to open a landfill
on the rural outskirts of the city and is offering annual payments
of $5 million over 30 years. For an area that's been struggling
economically since Griffiss Air Force Base was officially
deactivated five years ago, that's a tempting offer.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the 56-year-old Dunn, whose business lies right on
the southwest edge of the proposed landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point in time, I'm completely opposed to it,'' he
said. ''If they bring a landfill here, I want to see a complete
reduction in taxes. That landfill will completely demolish the
value of property.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he also was worried about the effects a landfill would
have on his outside business, which includes weddings, clambakes
and barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's going to want to be outside?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The city commission will look at potential effects a landfill
might have on health and safety, the environment, the overall
community image and the local economy, Griffo said. Residents'
reactions also will be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need facts -- not emotions -- right now,'' Griffo said. ''Our
door is open to discuss possible scenarios with any group. You
don't learn anything if you don't discuss and explore options.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed landfill would take trash now deposited at New York
City's Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, which is scheduled to
close in January 2002, according to the Greenbrier document. On
average, about 150 workers would be employed fulltime at the site,
the document states. All garbage would be transported by rail in
sealed, leak-proof containers.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbrier and its engineers are pursuing solid waste permits
from appropriate state agencies, including the Department of
Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Griffo, who said he was approached with the offer several weeks
ago, said Greebrier officials are hoping the city will make a
decision in the next couple months.
</P>
<P>
   ''My initial reaction is it's a proposal that needs to be
evaluated properly,'' the mayor said. ''That's what we're
attempting to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one-year-old Herbert Ischia, who lives a stone's throw
away from the proposed site of the landfill and owns about 85 acres
of land, doesn't know what to think. Greenbrier officials asked him
several months ago if he'd be willing to sell, but since Ischia and
his family have farmed the land for decades he's in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of my legacy,'' he said. ''If there's anything that
isn't right, I certainly won't sign my name. My name will not go on
anything that's shady.''

<HEADLINE> Court again sides with adult business vs. New York City  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A topless club in Manhattan is not an
''adult establishment'' within the meaning of New York City's
ordinance which seeks to zone sex-oriented businesses out of
residential and popular tourist areas of the city, a court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals unanimously ruled Thursday that the VIP
Club is does not fall under the zoning law, which the adult
businesses as those with a ''substantial portion'' of their floor
space devoted to sex-oriented materials.
</P>
<P>
   The definition is crucial to whether the VIP Club can stay at
its current location at West 20th Street. The city argued that
''any'' sexual-related activities at the VIP Club or other topless
clubs or X-rated theaters subjects them to the zoning ordinance,
the Court of Appeals noted.
</P>
<P>
   The law aims to consign businesses peddling sexually explicit
materials to industrially zoned areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The VIP Club argued that the same definition should apply to it
as has been used to describe what an adult bookstore is in the city
-- if 40 percent or more of its floor space is devoted to
sex-oriented merchandise. The VIP Club said it only offers topless
dancing on a mezzanine visible by less than 36 percent of its floor
space and it otherwise defines itself as an ''upscale cabaret with
topless entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   In its unsigned, unanimous ruling Thursday, the Court of Appeals
-- the state's highest court -- said the VIP Club was right. To rule
in the city's favor would cause the ''substantial portion''
component of the city's zoning ordinance to be ignored where any
adult-oriented entertainment was offered in eating and drinking
establishments, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling affirmed two lower court rulings about the
''substantial portion'' question.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the VIP Club's owners, Dezer Properties, Inc.,
called the decision ''another victory for First Amendment,
freedom-of-expression rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This will put an end to the city's heavy handed efforts to
close the VIP,'' Simon Rothkrug said. ''It is really a victory for
all topless clubs and adult theaters in the city of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, New York City's criminal justice coordinator,
said the ruling ''frustrates the obvious intent of the law by
making it possible for some businesses to evade the law's clear
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue vigorous enforcement and we will consider
legislative changes to insure that our residences, schools and
places of worship remain far from the shadows cast by strip clubs
and other adult businesses,'' Fishner said.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Court of Appeals sided with an adult
bookstore specializing in gay materials, Les Hommes, in another
challenge to the meaning of the 1995 sex shop zoning ordinance. In
that decision, the court upheld the 40 percent rule and rejected
city arguments that some adult bookstores were offering non-adult
materials in a ''sham'' compliance with the zoning ordinance.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton resumes attacks on Giuliani; mayor postpones new TVads  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has resumed her
attacks on Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani, ending a self-imposed
moratorium that began last week when the New York City mayor
announced he had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani on Thursday postponed a new round of
television commercials in deference to the death of Cardinal John
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a time for all New Yorkers to reflect on John
Cardinal O'Connor and what he meant to us all. We are therefore
delaying the start of our latest media buy,'' said Bruce
Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a campaign stop in Plattsburgh, praised O'Connor as
a ''champion of the rights of working people,'' and said she
planned to attend his funeral Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced last week that he is suffering from treatable
prostate cancer and has said he is not certain if he will be able
to continue in the Senate race. On Thursday in New York City, Gov.
George Pataki told reporters that he has ruled out running for
Senate whether or not Giuliani stays in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love my job as governor,'' Pataki said. Polls had the
governor as the top choice among Republicans to replace Giuliani if
the mayor dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   While Teitelbaum said O'Connor's death was the reason for the ad
delay, speculation swept through New York's political community
Thursday that it was an indication Giuliani had decided to exit the
race. Teitelbaum said no such decision had been made. Giuliani
campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin said the ads would begin running
today.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton attacked Giuliani for saying he would vote
to keep Jesse Helms as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee and for his call for congressional hearings on the Elian
Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also leveled her harshest criticism to date over
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's call for an across-the-board tax cut, a
plan the New York City mayor has said he could support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed the mayor would continue to politicize
this little boy's future and this case, which is properly in the
courts,'' the first lady told reporters outside Clinton Community
College when asked about the mayor's call for congressional
hearings on the Elian Gonzalez case. ''I do not believe further
hearings in the Congress are called for.''
</P>
<P>
   She said such hearings would simply be used ''to score political
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss countered,
''Mrs. Clinton has taken so many divergent and contradictory
positions on the fate of this boy, we're sure that come next week
she'll be calling for hearings also.''
</P>
<P>
   At a televised college forum from Rochester, the New York City
mayor also said Wednesday that if he were in the Senate he would
vote to keep the conservative Helms as chairman of the powerful
Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the big differences between me and the mayor is that I
would not vote to make Jesse Helms the chairman,'' Clinton said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a lot of problems with the chairman pertaining to
votes on issues that have been lying dormant in his committee for
many years,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Glover Weiss said, ''Just as the mayor believes
that wide diversity in communities is a strength, he believes that
diversity in political parties is healthy too.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the college, Clinton was greeted with silence as she told
a largely Republican audience of about 150 that she would not
support Bush's across-the-board tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are many Republicans in this audience and I look
forward to working with Republicans and Democrats ... but I want
you to know I cannot support Governor Bush's large,
across-the-board tax cut,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Many on hand were local business leaders. The morning event was
sponsored jointly by the college and the local chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she felt the Bush tax cut ''would severely drain
resources form New York.'' The first lady said she favored smaller,
targeted tax cuts and paying down the national debt.

<HEADLINE> Some Attica survivors will reject money  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Some relatives of guards killed in the 1971
Attica prison riot plan to refuse their share of a $550,000
compensation payment from New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The payment plan was crafted by state leaders this year after
Attica inmates won approval of a $12 million settlement from New
York -- with about $4 million of that going to legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The payment of $50,000 to each of the 11 families of slain
prison workers was meant to provide a degree of balance. A number
of families said they were not told immediately following the riot
that by signing death benefit checks, they were forfeiting their
right to sue state officials.
</P>
<P>
   A group of surviving relatives has complained the payment to
guards' relatives is too small and fails to address larger issues
surrounding the tragedy. As state lawmakers prepared Thursday to
vote on the budget that would authorize the payment, two surviving
relatives said they were among a group that would refuse the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too little too late,'' said Ann Valone, whose husband
Carl was taken hostage and killed at Attica. ''That's not
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Valone and other survivors believe the state needs to do more to
address the tragedy that claimed the lives of 32 inmates and 11
prison employees, most of whom died during the violent retaking of
Attica by state troopers on Sept. 13, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   A group of survivors calling themselves Forgotten Victims of
Attica want New York state to open sealed records related to the
case; apologize for the state's retaking of the prison; provide
counseling for survivors and injured guards; support a yearly
ceremony outside the prison and to also provide money for the
surviving guards taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money is not the issue with me or with our entire
family,'' said Valone's daughter, Maryann Valone.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cunningham, whose father Edward was a prison guard shot to
death in the retaking, also said his family would refuse the money.
He said 10 families voted at a survivors' meeting in April not to
accept the payment. Members of two of those families reached for
comment Thursday said they were not sure if they would take the
money.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Dale Volker, a Buffalo-area Republican who
spearheaded the compensation plan, has said $550,000 is the most
money Assembly Democrats would agree to pay. Volker aide Joe
Maltese did not rule out the Legislature taking up the families'
other requests later.
</P>
<P>
   A group of families is planning to lobby at the state Capitol
later this month.

<HEADLINE> Pretrial records in Diallo case to be unsealed  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Lawyers' arguments concerning initial
witness interviews on Amadou Diallo's shooting by New York City
police, as well as motions on police personnel files, will be
unsealed, a midlevel appeals court decided.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member Appellate Division of state Supreme Court panel
also said on Thursday that Justice Joseph C. Teresi could have made
the records public after risks of excessive pretrial publicity had
passed, though the appellate court agreed with Teresi's decision to
seal the records just before ''a crucial time'' -- prior to jury
selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that after a long and unwarranted delay the
motion papers are being released to the public,'' David Schulz, an
attorney for The Associated Press, said.
</P>
<P>
   The AP, along with seven other news organizations had petitioned
for release of the records stemming from a closed pretrial session
Teresi held in December.
</P>
<P>
   The court dismissed the petition the newsgroups brought against
the judge, saying the records will be made public along with trial
documents that Teresi unsealed after the officers were acquitted of
murder and other charges in February.
</P>
<P>
   Appellate Division Justice Thomas Mercure, writing for the
judicial panel, said ''it cannot be doubted'' that release of the
documents sought by reporters ''would have generated considerable
media attention on irrelevant and prejudicial information at a
crucial time,'' as a jury was just about to be picked in Albany
County.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of such information at that time on prejudicing the
Albany County jury pool, which is much smaller than the Bronx Jury
pool, ''would be at its greatest,'' Mercure said.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations had wanted to see documents that included
the white officers' personnel records and previous complaints
lodged against them as well as tapes and transcripts of interviews
with witnesses to the February 1999 shooting of Diallo, an African
immigrant, in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi, Albany County Supreme Court judge, took over the case
after it was moved when courts determined pretrial publicity in the
Bronx had made it impossible to select an unbiased jury.
</P>
<P>
   It had already been reported that three of the four officers
were involved in other shootings -- all of which were deemed
justified. Because of large-scale public protests that racism
motivated shooting the unarmed Diallo, there was great interest in
information about the officers' records.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi's pretrial hearing in December had not been announced to
the public and when a New York Daily News reporter learned it was
underway and asked to be admitted, the journalist was denied.
</P>
<P>
   While the transcripts and personnel records are no longer in the
court's possession, the records of attorneys' motions were sent to
the Albany County courthouse after Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court blamed the delay of the release of records
on the media itself for not proposing to unseal the documents after
jury selection was completed. Schulz said Thursday that the news
organizations had, in fact, sought an alternative arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The AP, Daily News, Newsday, the New York Post, The New York
Times, the Albany Times Union, the New York Law Journal and Clear
Channel Communications, Inc., challenged Teresi's actions in the
Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments in a separate petition by the same organizations,
seeking access to evidence including police reports and grand jury
transcripts which were admitted during the jury trial, are
scheduled for Friday in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the attorney representing one of the police officers
was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Coogan Is Confident, Brantly Is Not  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mark Coogan and Keith Brantly were teammates
on the 1996 U.S. Olympic marathon team. This year, there's a good
chance they'll be separated.
</P>
<P>
   The exuberant Coogan comes into Sunday's Olympic marathon trials
as one of the favorites to make the three-man team. Although he has
not run a marathon in two years, he won his last two races at
shorter distances, and, as usual, is bubbling with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The more introspective Brantly has been beset with nagging
injuries. So despite having won the U.S. Marathon Championship in
1998 on Sunday's course, he is approaching the race with great
trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm running well enough to finish in the top three,''
said Coogan, the runner-up at the 1996 trials at Charlotte, N.C.,
in 2 hours, 13 minutes, 5 seconds -- 17 seconds ahead of Brantly.
</P>
<P>
   Coogan's confidence received a boost March 24 when he won an
8-kilometer race in Chicago, beating Todd Williams, another
favorite Sunday, and three Kenyans. He followed that with a victory
in a 15K race at Washington, D.C., last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The times weren't great -- 22:59 for 8K and 44:40 for 15K -- but
they were just what I wanted,'' Coogan said.
</P>
<P>
   One disadvantage for Coogan is that he is unfamiliar with the
tough, hilly course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never even been to Pittsburgh,'' he said before arriving
for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Brantly, on the other hand, ran his best marathon on the course.
He won the U.S. championship two years ago at 2:12:31 and earned a
$100,000 bonus for the fastest time ever by an American over the
testing course.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he might not even finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like I did in '98 for Pittsburgh or in '96 for
the trials,'' he said. ''I've had a long-standing hamstring injury
and a lot of back problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''My lumbar impinges on one of my nerves, and that causes the
hamstring to tie up. If I increase my mileage and intensity, it
irritates my nerves. Running over the years has caused a disk to
come down and the nerve to move over. It's gotten progressively
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Brantly calls his course record ''soft,'' because no one pushed
him the final 10 miles, and he ''will be surprised if someone
doesn't go under 2:11 Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Brantly is not likely to be the one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little worried about my back and my hamstring,'' he
said. ''I would like to be fit and ready to go, but my back is very
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be tough for me to run under five-minute pace.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was tough for Brantly, Coogan and 1996 trials winner Bob
Kempainen -- who now is practicing medicine -- at the Atlanta Games.
None ever was a factor and all finished far back. Coogan was 28th,
Kempainen 31st and Brantly 41st behind gold medalist Josia Thugwane
of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Coogan says the ''heat and the excitement got to me.'' Brantly
says he overtrained and went into the games ''a little overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The humidity was oppressive and it was about 80 degrees,''
Coogan said. ''I got too hydrated. I couldn't lift my feet up the
last five miles. After the race, I had three IVs (intravenous
treatments) under the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the marathon, which is traditionally held on the final
day of the games, Coogan got caught up in too much of the Olympic
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just can't watch the Dream Team and all those other
sports,'' he said. ''I wish the marathon was on the first day of
the games instead of the last. Then I could enjoy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Brantly apparently left his best race in training.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably trained too much,'' he said. ''I ran better in
workouts than at the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't pay attention to the pacing. When the pace started to
go at 13 miles, I didn't go. I was done at 20. It took everything I
had to hang on. I lost about 10 places in the last two kilometers.
I didn't maximize my fitness level.''
</P>
<P>
   If Coogan doesn't make the team, he has a backup plan; he will
compete for a berth on the 10,000-meter team at the track trials at
Sacramento, Calif., in July. One thing's for certain: if he makes
the team in the marathon or 10,000, he won't be joined by his wife,
Gwyn, as he was in 1996 when she competed in the 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gwyn dropped out of the women's marathon trials in February with
a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   For Coogan and Brantly, this year probably will be their final
shot at the Olympics. Brantly will be 38 on May 23; Coogan is 34.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Shooting for Derby Win No. 5  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- When you've won four Kentucky Derbys like
D. Wayne Lukas has, you have every reason to beam with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no one better at touting his own thoroughbreds than
Lukas. After all, the Hall of Fame trainer has won three of the
last five Derbys, and is back for his 20th consecutive Run for the
Roses with three horses, giving him a record 38 starters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be going over with a pretty good little arsenal,'' Lukas
said Thursday. ''We're not exactly 30-1. If you're a gloom and doom
guy, you better get another profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas singled out Blue Grass Stakes winner High Yield as his
best chance to win Saturday's 1\-mile Derby. High Yield, with four
wins, four seconds and three thirds in 12 career starts, is among
the most consistent 3-year-olds in the 19-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ''High Yield is doing the best of all the horses,'' Lukas said
of yet another one of his horses by Storm Cat. ''He's had only one
less than sterling performance (sixth in the Kentucky Jockey Club
at Churchill Downs), but I wouldn't hold that against him.''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield, with Pat Day aboard, is part of a four-horse entry
with Lukas' Commendable and the Todd-Pletcher-trained Trippi and
Impeachment. The entry is 5-1, third in the morning line behind 9-5
favorite Fusaichi Pegasus and 4-1 choice The Deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange Rate, Lukas' other horse, is 30-1.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is convinced High Yield will win. Asked about Day being
aboard, Lukas said: ''He is absolutely the premier rider in
Kentucky and he's held his own in every other arena. But this is
his arena. He won the Derby with a Pennsylvania colt named Lil E.
Tee and he's going to ride another one on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the fact none of his Storm Cat offsprings have
won the Derby: ''We'll put an end to that Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the post position: Exchange Rate and High Yield
will start from the auxiliary gate. High Yield leaves from the No.
17 spot, Exchange Rate from No. 16, and Commendable from No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not worried, we've won from outside before,'' Lukas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas won with Charismatic in 1999 and Thunder Gulch in 1995
from the No. 16 post; Grindstone in 1996 from the No. 15 post; and
Winning Colors in 1988 from the No. 11 post. The auxiliary gate
holds the horses in posts 15-19.
</P>
<P>
   Post positions were shifted Thursday when Globalize was
scratched after being injured when kicked in the lower left hind
leg by his accompanying pony. Globalize, a 50-1 shot, was in the
No. 1 post, meaning the other 19 horses move in a gate.
</P>
<P>
   Anees, the 2-year-old champion and winner of the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile, now leaves from the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a large field, Lukas maintains getting too caught up
in strategy isn't always good.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a matter of letting them go out and seeing how it all
unfolds,'' he said. ''Hollywood scripts don't always work out. As
I've said, we may not cover the spread, we just win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if a horse is to have a chance at winning the Derby,
''you better be able to be in position to do something in the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lukas-Day combo has won its share of Triple Crown races, but
not the Derby. Day has won the Preakness three times for Lukas, and
the Belmont Stakes once. He rode Preakness winners Tank's Prospect
in 1985; Tabasco Cat in '94 and Timber Country in '95; Tabasco Cat
won the '94 Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, like just about everyone else, is impressed with Fusaichi
Pegasus, bought for $4 million by Japanese entrepreneur Fusao
Sekiguchi. Lukas, it turns out, was the underbidder when the Mr.
Prospector colt was sold at the Keeneland July yearling sales.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if we would have beat the guy,'' Lukas, who was
bidding for a group consisting of Satish Sanan, Michael Tabor and
Susan Magnier, said. ''Heck, I might have been able to buy a whole
stable for $4 million. In hindsight, I'd like to have the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas' final bid was $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus lost his only start as a 2-year-old, finishing
second to David Copperfield in a 6{-furlong race at Hollywood Park.
He's won four in a row since, including a 4\-length victory in the
Wood Memorial. He's also beaten Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy
in the San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fusaichi Pegasus, trainer Neil Drysdale also
saddles War Chant, the 6-1 fourth choice.
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher, in his first Derby, will send out four horses -- Graeme
Hall, Impeachment, More Than Ready and Trippi.
</P>
<P>
   If all 19 starters go, the Derby will have a record $1,188,200
purse, with the winner taking home $888,200. Second place is worth
$170,000, third $85,000; and fourth $45,000.

<HEADLINE> Stankowski Leads Compaq Classic  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The first day of the Compaq Classic was a
breeze for Paul Stankowski.
</P>
<P>
   Stankowski was one of the few players at the tournament to cope
with gusty winds that blew in the afternoon. Stankowski had seven
birdies on his way to a 1-stroke lead over seven golfers with a
6-under-par 66 in Thursday's first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the wind,'' Stankowski said. ''I've won in Hawaii twice
in the blowing wind. I enjoy the wind. It makes you think a little
bit more. It keeps you from getting complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   Stankowski had seven birdies in gusts that reached 20 mph. Steve
Hart and Glen Day were the only ones of the group tied for second
that played in the afternoon. The others, including defending
champion Carlos Franco, played in more manageable morning
conditions, with winds about 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But Stankowski bogeyed his final hole on the 7,116-yard English
Turn Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little disappointed by my finish, but all in all, I'm
very pleased,'' Stankowski said. ''I'm driving the ball well. I
think I've got things kind of clicking right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The others at 67 were Scott McCarron, Ernie Els, Bob Burns and
K.J. Choi.
</P>
<P>
   Els, Choi and Day were the only players with bogey-free rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Masters champion Vijay Singh was in a group of eight at 68,
while 17 players were at 69. Jack Nicklaus led a group of 14 at 70.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, on the strength of his ''happy putter,'' offset two
bogeys with seven birdies and needed only 28 putts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel the same as last year,'' Franco said. ''I played very
well last week. I had a chance to win and came here more strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's PGA rookie of the year, Franco has finished in the
top 10 in four of his 10 events this year. He opened last year's
Compaq Classic with a 66, a score he matched in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, who won the New Orleans tournament in 1996 after
switching to a new driver, played with a new set of irons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a lot of good feelings stepping on the first tee,''
McCarron said. ''I got off to a good start, birdied the first hole,
and I put a new set of irons in my bag this week for the first time
since 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron combined an eagle on No. 6, a par-5, with four birdies
and a bogey to match his best opening-round score this year.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal forged special bond with paralyzed cop  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At the darkest hour of his life, Officer Steven
McDonald opened his eyes in a Manhattan hospital. He could move
little else; a gunman's bullet had left him paralyzed below the
chin.
</P>
<P>
   He was surrounded that evening in July 1986 by his pregnant
wife, some family members, and one unfamiliar face: Cardinal John
O'Connor, who had sped down to Bellevue Hospital from his midtown
residence.
</P>
<P>
   In those hours after a teen thief nicknamed ''Buddha'' pumped a
bullet through McDonald's spinal cord, a bond was forged between
the cardinal and the 29-year-old cop.
</P>
<P>
   It never broke until O'Connor's Wednesday night death.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was Christ-like,'' McDonald remembered Thursday, one day
after the cardinal's death. ''He became a spiritual guide to
navigate the very difficult areas of life that I experience all too
often.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was in Denver's Craig Hospital as part of his
continuing treatment when news of O'Connor's death arrived. He
recalled how quickly the dynamics of their relationship changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My introduction to John O'Connor was as the archbishop, less
than 24 hours after I was shot,'' said McDonald. ''Within a few
weeks, he became a member of our family, and we became his good
friends, and it stayed that way for 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, after McDonald's wife Patti Ann delivered
their son Conor, the cardinal baptized the boy at St. Patrick's
Cathedral. It was March 1, 1987 -- the policeman's 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal later gave Conor his First Communion in St.
Patrick's. Two years ago, Conor McDonald was an altar server for
midnight Mass on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Patrick's Day, when Steven McDonald would don his police
uniform and head up Fifth Avenue in his motorized wheelchair, the
cardinal would walk down the cathedral steps to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was loyal and loving beyond normal understanding,''
McDonald recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It was July 7, 1986, when the two Irish-Americans first
improbably met.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, a third-generation police officer in his second year
on the job, was working plainclothes patrol in Central Park when a
15-year-old bicycle thief fired three shots into his head. McDonald
was instantly paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Then-mayor Edward I. Koch remembered the heart-wrenching scene
when he arrived at Bellevue: the horribly injured officer, his
three-month pregnant wife, the shellshocked relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was crying uncontrollably, like a baby,'' recalled Koch, who
put in a call to O'Connor. ''He said, 'I'll be right there.' He
came down and comforted that family, went to the bedside with
Steven.
</P>
<P>
   ''They kept that relationship to this very day.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's close ties to McDonald were no surprise to police
officers familiar with the cardinal's modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   ''When someone was hurt or killed in the line of duty, in a very
quiet but very deliberate way, he was always there to offer counsel
and help to the families,'' recalled Police Commissioner Howard
Safir.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald family certainly qualified. During one of his early
meetings with Steven, O'Connor delivered a message that the
quadriplegic cop soon made his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''You remind me so much of Christ right now,'' O'Connor told the
wounded cop one day. ''If you united yourself and your helplessness
with Christ on the cross, you are the most powerful man in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The words stayed with McDonald, who became a messenger of
forgiveness and met with the pope and Nelson Mandela. The death of
O'Connor won't erase those words.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always, and will be, a presence in the life of my
family and me,'' McDonald said.

<HEADLINE> Ivy Rivalry Big in Presidential Bid  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- It's been 88 years since a Yalie and a
Harvard man squared off for the ultimate Ivy League bragging right
-- president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both lost.
</P>
<P>
   That embarrassing outcome is unlikely this year as the schools
dust off their pennants for the contest between Yale grad George W.
Bush and Harvard alum Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the prestigious universities has always been
intense. Sometimes silly, too. Witness this Harvard newspaper
headline about a football game in 1968: ''Harvard Beats Yale
29-29.''
</P>
<P>
   On receiving an honorary degree from Yale, President Kennedy (a
Harvard graduate) remarked he had the best of both worlds: a
Harvard education and a Yale diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The scorecard at these elite schools is kept in many ways: Who
has the most distinguished faculty, the most Nobel Prizes, the most
accomplished graduates?
</P>
<P>
   Into this mix go Vice President Gore and Texas Gov. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is on the alumni mailing list for both universities, having
also graduated from Harvard Business School. But Yale claims the
pedigree since Bush got his undergraduate degree there in 1968. His
father and grandfather also were Yale men.
</P>
<P>
   Gore graduated from Harvard in 1969 with a degree in government.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the two schools faced off in a presidential
election was 1912, when Harvard grad Theodore Roosevelt and Yale
alum William Howard Taft were both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   They were beaten by Princeton's Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential contenders' undergraduate lives were
similar in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   Both were bench warmers on college teams: Gore played
basketball, Bush played baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They came from political families but steered away from the
radical politics of the day when they got to the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   They both earned middling grades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both got gentlemen's C's, which I found to be very reassuring
-- that's what I got, too,'' said Victor Ashe, mayor of Knoxville,
Tenn., who graduated from Yale a year before Bush and ran against
Gore for the Senate in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Ashe, who was the political editor of the Yale Daily News,
counts the Bushes as old family friends -- their families had homes
on the same Florida island.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not active in campus politics, or in the anti-Vietnam
War activism of the day, Ashe recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was active on campus, but more in sports and his
fraternity,'' he said. Ashe and Bush were members of Skull and
Bones, one of the ''secret societies'' for Yale seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not belong to such groups at Harvard -- called ''final
clubs'' there -- and his family did not have a Harvard legacy going
back generations.
</P>
<P>
   A roommate, Mike Kapetan of Ann Arbor, Mich., said Gore -- often
portrayed as wooden and wonkish -- was a smart, original thinker.
</P>
<P>
   ''The person I read about in the newspaper simply does not
exist,'' Kapetan said. ''He's a real human being to me -- a lively
personality and a stimulating conversationalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was more involved in politics, including student government
as a freshman, but he shied away from the anti-Vietnam protests
that captivated Harvard the year he graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of his college buddies, Gore enlisted in the war
after graduation. Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledges he smoked marijuana in college. Bush won't go
into that, though he has said he has not used illegal drugs in the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On both campuses, political support is driven more by ideology
than school spirit, students say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bragging rights help, said Marc Stad, president of the
Harvard College Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The group has used the Gore-Harvard connection in e-mails and
posters to sign up students to help the vice president's campaign
on campus: ''Support your fellow Harvardian in his pursuit for the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yale College Republicans -- greatly outnumbered by Democrats
on campus -- also have used their candidate's background to win
election support. ''George W. Bush '68'' and ''Yale is Bush
Territory'' are favorite slogans, said Patrick Bumatay, a leader of
the Texas governor's campaign at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush's going to Yale provides a little more motivation to go
out and campaign for him,'' Bumatay said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pushes for Hispanic Voters  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Resuming his push for California Hispanics,
George W. Bush was marking today's Mexican holiday of Cinco de Mayo
amid fresh evidence that the crucial voter bloc is leaning heavily
toward Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to appear at a U.S.-Mexico Foundation breakfast,
followed by a meeting with Hispanic leaders in San Diego County,
which shares a border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the de facto GOP presidential nominee departed from
his schedule to campaign in heavily Hispanic Santa Ana, which has
become an emblem of rising Hispanic political power.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor walked the streets of a bustling Hispanic
neighborhood, chatted with residents in Spanish, wolfed down tacos
and called himself ''Jorge.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush, who is Methodist, attended Roman
Catholic Mass in Orange County. Most Hispanics are Catholic, but
Bush said politics played no role in his appearance there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made direct appeals to Hispanics a staple of his
campaign swings to California, where 16 percent of the electorate
is Hispanic, compared to 10 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released this week suggested his challenge remains
formidable.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Hispanic voters has increased by 1 million in the
past decade, and that trend has overwhelmingly benefited Democrats,
according to the Field Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics remain alienated from the GOP, which led fights
during the 1990s against illegal immigration, affirmative action
and bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, nearly half of all Hispanics currently
on the voter rolls have registered since 1994, when California
voters passed Proposition 187 outlawing most state services to
illegal immigrants. Then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson led the
campaign for the ballot measure, which later was scuttled by
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   That measure inspired many Hispanics to register and vote, the
pollsters said, and today Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans
among registered Hispanics in California. Sixty percent of
Hispanics in recent Field Institute surveys said they are
Democrats, 22 percent said they are Republicans and 18 percent said
they are not affiliated with either party.
</P>
<P>
   California Hispanic voters also preferred Democrat Al Gore over
Bush by about 3-to-1 in a March exit poll by Voter News Service for
The Associated Press and the television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news conference how he would repair the political
damage inflicted by Wilson, Bush said, ''I've got a record to run
on as governor of Texas. I've told our state we weren't going to
bash immigrants and I think people here have heard that message,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   There was good news, too, in Field Poll for Bush, who has been
trying to reposition himself in the political center in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About half of California Hispanics, 47 percent, say they are
political moderates, while 31 percent are conservative and 22
percent are liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Cinco de Mayo is a Mexican holiday marking the May 5, 1862,
victory by a small army of Mexican patriots and peasants over
stronger French forces.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Residents Describe Blast  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH, Associated press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- The hail of burning wreckage and
body parts that plummeted six miles from the sky onto Lockerbie,
Scotland, 11 years ago deeply scarred the residents of the Scottish
town.
</P>
<P>
   The horror of that evening of Dec. 21, 1988, and the traumatic
aftereffects were vividly recalled Thursday at the trial of two
Libyans accused of the mass murder of 270 people -- 259 on the
bombed Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 townspeople on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding the first week of the trial today, the Scottish court
was to hear investigators explain how they sifted through the tens
of thousands of pieces of debris that were blown across Scotland on
that windy night.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans accused of the bombing, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, could face life imprisonment
if three Scottish judges find them guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has accused Palestinian groups unrelated to the
defendants, hoping to create enough doubt to win a verdict of ''not
proven,'' which would be tantamount to an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Lockerbie residents told of the hellish scene that still haunts
them: gardens littered with corpses, burning houses and cars, and
the thunderous roar of the jetliner as it plunged from 31,000 feet
onto their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like an atomic bomb,'' said 37-year-old Ian Wood,
''like mushrooms flaring up, you could feel the heat all around
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he still suffers anxiety attacks and other health
problems stemming from the disaster which flattened two houses
across the street from his own.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 relatives of American victims listened from behind a
bulletproof glass partition. Some said it was the first time they
had emerged from their own pain to consider the tragedy of others.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen members of the Libyans' families also watched the
hearings at the former U.S. Air Force base 40 miles east of
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw my father in court for the first time I felt very
upset, but I'm certain he'll be acquitted with the will of God,''
said Ghada al-Megrahi.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the trial, defense council Bill Taylor
cross examined a prosecution witness, suggesting to police officer
Geoffrey Carpenter that the evidence at Lockerbie could have been
tampered with before investigators arrived 90 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter admitted it would have been impossible to secure such
a large scene.
</P>
<P>
   Libya was under international sanctions for seven years until it
surrendered the accused, in a compromise that called for the trial
to be held without a jury on the neutral territory of the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Teacher Standards Plan  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLT, Mich. (AP) -- After spending a day in high school, Vice
President Al Gore was presenting his plan for teacher
certification, testing and, where there's failure, firing, to an
audience traditionally resistant to such mandates but heartily
behind his presidential campaign -- the teachers unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who spent an abbreviated night at the home of a Holt High
School computer teacher and her family, was immersing himself today
in the school's routine ''to learn more, in depth'' about what
education reforms are needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, he addresses the Michigan Education Association
convention. ''Let me begin with a simple pledge,'' the Democratic
presidential candidate said in prepared remarks provided to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will ensure that there
is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single
classroom, everywhere in this nation by the end of the next four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   At each stop on this two-day campaign swing through the crucial
Midwest battleground, Gore sounded fixated on ''the intensity'' of
his support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two things will decide the election, how you stand on the
issues and the amount of intensity you bring to the campaign,'' he
told a discourteous crowd of Democrats who talked among themselves
throughout his remarks at a $1-million fund-raiser in Chicago
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   To Hispanic community leaders on Chicago's west side, Gore said,
''I'm counting on you to more than match the intensity of the other
side.'' For good measure, he added a plug for today's Mexican
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grandson was born on the Fourth of July,'' he said. ''If I
have another grandchild, I hope he's born on Cinco de Mayo.''
</P>
<P>
   After his Chicago stops, Gore arrived well past midnight at the
suburban Lansing home of Margo and Jay Strong, both teachers, and
their two young children. Included in briefing materials meant to
give Gore a head start on his late-night attempt to become
acquainted with the family was the fact that they like camping,
riding bikes, and Michigan State basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on union support to mobilize voters in the fall, Gore,
in his new education proposals today, trod more gingerly on the
question of firing bad teachers than on testing teacher competence
against national standards.
</P>
<P>
   He would establish an $8 billion, 10-year fund for previously
proposed, across-the-board salary increases of $5,000 for qualified
teachers but would make the fund available only to school districts
who, ''in the context of due process protections ... quickly remove
those teachers who really should be removed from the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal does not specify how such teachers should be
identified, but requires ''quick, intensive efforts to help them
improve'' before they are fired and higher standards for tenure,
including proven student performance.
</P>
<P>
   A separate $8 billion, 10-year fund would provide signing
bonuses, scholarships and college aid aimed at recruiting 1 million
new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also would establish new prerequisites for the Title 1
money aimed at poor children and given to states:
</P>
<P>
   --By 2004, states must make sure every teacher is fully
certified, with middle and high school teachers additionally
required to demonstrate expertise in the subject they teach. The
Gore campaign said one in four secondary school teachers now lack a
minor in their main teaching field and too many teachers are
installed under ''emergency'' certificates, which means they do not
meet state standards for certification.
</P>
<P>
   --New teachers must pass ''rigorous assessments, including tests
of their subject matter and teaching proficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   --Elementary school teachers must be tested to ensure they know
how to teach reading.
</P>
<P>
   National standards for these assessments would be developed
through an unspecified ''independent, non-governmental effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore last week proposed denying a slice of Title 1 funds to
schools whose student performance falls short.

<HEADLINE> Improved US-Iran Ties Face Hurdles  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's quest
for improved relations with Iran is being complicated by
congressional moves to make Iran pay for alleged involvement in
terrorist activities against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation under consideration would make it easier for
terrorist victims to collect multimillion-dollar judgments by
seizing assets from the nations that sponsored the activity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say Americans who claim to have been targets of
Iran have tracked more than $20 billion in Iranian funds earmarked
by the pre-1979 American-backed government in Iran for weapons
purchases in the United States. The weapons were paid for but never
delivered because of Iran's stridently anti-American policies
dating from the 1979 revolution. The funds are sitting in U.S.
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been approved by the Senate Judiciary
Committee and has bipartisan support in both the House and Senate
despite strong administration opposition. Extensive consultations
to work out a compromise with lawmakers have made no progress,
sources on both sides say.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, asking not to be identified, said
three alternate proposals offered to Capitol Hill have been met
with silence.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, R-N.J., a chief backer of the proposal,
says the administration's concerns are understandable. But, he
added: ''We can't shrink from our responsibility to deter terrorism
against American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address on Iran in March, Albright promised a stepped up
effort to settle Iran's claims against the United States and vice
versa. The proposal was part of a broader administration effort to
resume official dealings with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   To push the claims issue, Albright named David Andrews, a San
Francisco lawyer and former State Department legal adviser, as her
point man at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, the only channel in which the two countries maintain
official contact.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews flew to The Hague last week for talks with Dr. Goudarz
Eftekhar-Jahromi, a longtime legal adviser to Iranian presidents.
Andrews declined comment on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview beforehand, Andrews said resolving the weapons
sales claims has been excruciatingly slow because millions of
pieces of equipment are involved. The transactions spawned enough
documents to fill entire warehouses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of the claims has been settled because so much effort has
been required,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright wants the issue resolved in hopes of reinforcing
the ascendancy of moderate forces in Iran, reflected in
parliamentary elections this past February. In the same vein, she
also announced in her March speech an easing of curbs on certain
Iranian imports.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation being considered would enable U.S. terrorism
victims to collect on court-ordered judgments by allowing them
access to blocked assets of the offending nation. Additionally, it
would authorize the sale of that country's U.S. properties,
excluding the embassy. The proceeds would go to terrorism victims.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews says approval of the legislation could lead to
retaliatory confiscation of American assets and properties overseas
and would make settlement of the Iranian claims issue ''extremely
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's resistance to the proposal has angered
Terry Anderson, a former chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He holds Iran responsible for the nearly seven
years he spent as a hostage in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says the administration has done nothing to help him
collect a $341 million judgment against Iran ordered in March by a
U.S. district judge in Washington. His anger is shared by Stephen
Flatow, of West Orange, N.J., who maintains that his daughter,
killed in Israel in 1995, was another of Iran's victims. He was
awarded a $247 million judgment against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who backs the legislation, says,
''It is time to send a strong message to terrorists and their state
sponsors that they cannot get away with murder.''

<HEADLINE> Marine Has Sung for 7 Presidents  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don Quixote wore a suit of rusty armor, but
he'll don the scarlet-and-blue dress uniform of the U.S. Marines
when Master Gunnery Sgt. Michael Ryan does his farewell performance
after 30 years entertaining seven presidents and more than 2,000
public concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan likes ''Man of La Mancha'' and plans to do more than sing
the special arrangement made for him from its tunes, even if the
formal Marine wear of a 190-pound Marine, complete with white
epaulettes, isn't quite appropriate for the skinny knight of the
1500s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll talk and act some, and the audience will have a little
suspension of disbelief,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A six footer, he has the 45-inch chest measurement as well as
the musical background that fit the baritone for the heroic roles
in Richard Wagner's operas. He can range from opera to the
satirical ditties that have made him a 30-year regular at the
Gridiron Club, the annual dinner of a senior Washington news group.
There, he uses costume and make-up to impersonate political
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done so many presidential candidates I can't remember
them all off the top of my head,'' he said. ''There was Hubert
Humphrey and year before last it was Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't recall, he said, whom he was impersonating when he
had his most memorable Gridiron experience -- ''being kissed on one
cheek by Beverly Sills and by Elizabeth Taylor on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is only the second vocalist the Marine Band has had in the
two centuries since Thomas Jefferson, a violinist, made it ''the
president's own.'' It can form any kind of musical ensemble now,
from full symphony orchestra to harp-and-flute duo -- by way of
oom-pah band and jazz combo.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to find the vocal experiment successful. Ryan's
successor Kevin Bennear, another baritone, came on the job earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has made his whole career with the military, he and
the other 142 members of the band do no military service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Marine Corps is a low-budget organization,'' he explained.
''They're not going to spend money to train someone to use the
bayonet if their job is going to be to play the violin.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes to recall performing ''America the Beautiful'' at
President Reagan's first inaugural, just as the American hostages
were being released in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also sang at a Clinton inaugural.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Jessye Norman and I are the only ones to have done two
presidential inaugurations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential musical tastes differ.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the surprise party the band set up for the Ford
family's last night in the White House, when he sang the haunting
folk song ''Shenandoah.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Then there was dancing -- it was a kind of family affair that
we were all part of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters, who came in next, preferred classical music.
</P>
<P>
   At 57, Ryan has sung for every president since Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoyed the Reagans and the Bushes most -- if only because
they always called me by name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks of himself basically as an opera singer and wouldn't
mind doing some opera in retirement, as well as more popular
entertainment and some additional teaching. Being a baritone
doesn't limit him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The principles of singing aren't confined to one voice or
another,'' he said. ''They apply to all voices, men and women
both.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Looks To Resume Vieques Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as it prepares to resume bombing the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques for target practice, the Navy is
searching the seas for alternative sites to train sailors and
Marines of the Atlantic fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The search for alternatives reflects the reality that even
though the Navy is now in a position to exercise on Vieques for the
first time in a year, it still faces considerable opposition from
islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Robert Natter, the Navy's director of operations, told
a Pentagon news conference on Thursday that as recently as a week
ago he reviewed the Navy's options in the event that the 9,300
people on Vieques vote to expel the Navy. A referendum is to be
held as early as August or as late as February 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will tell you that we have seen nothing that comes close to
providing the training opportunities that are at Vieques, either in
parts or in full, at one location,'' Natter said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-star admiral said exercises being conducted now by the
George Washington carrier battle group elsewhere in the Caribbean
and off the East Coast of the United States are ''deficient'' in
naval gunfire training. He said it was possible that such training
could be done on Vieques if the range is readied quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   The George Washington battle group is scheduled to begin a
six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents removed more than 200 protesters from the naval
bombing range on the eastern tip of Vieques on Thursday, and
Marines moved in quickly to seal the perimeter as Coast Guard
vessels patrolled the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the yearlong standoff with protesters, the Navy has
asserted that the island is critical to the complex, combined arms
training that a carrier battle group must undertake to be ready for
combat. Residents complain the bombing is an unjustified disruption
of their small island.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Kevin Green, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Southern
Command, said in a telephone interview Thursday that once training
resumes, the Navy will scale back its bombing to a maximum of 90
days per year from the previous 180 days, and that only
non-explosive bombs will be dropped. Those limitations were spelled
out in an agreement reached in January between President Clinton
and Gov. Pedro Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the removal of the protesters was an important step
toward resolving the Vieques dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Navy will now concentrate on improving our long-term
relationship with Puerto Rico and Vieques,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, meanwhile, said the Navy will
stick by its pledge to respect the outcome of a referendum by the
people of Vieques on whether the Navy should abandon the training
range entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the private Business Executives for National
Security at a Pentagon luncheon, Danzig said his main concern was
that those who are calling on the Navy to quit Vieques immediately
will prevail over those -- including the Puerto Rican government --
who favor waiting for the outcome of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has not trained on Vieques since April 1999, when
errant bombs dropped by a Marine Corps F-18 fighter jet killed a
civilian security guard. Puerto Rican protesters immediately
occupied the range, on the eastern tip of the island, and the Navy
was forced to cancel several major training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Navy will need at least several days to
repair fence lines on Vieques, make sure no trespassers remain,
check on the status of bombing targets such as plywood placards and
old tanks and certify that the range is safe to use.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said exercises would resume sometime in the next six
weeks. Natter said it would be ''within weeks,'' and Green said it
would be ''in the near term.'' Other Navy officials said it could
be as early as two weeks from now.

<HEADLINE> Flyers, Penguins Tied After 4 OTs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh
Penguins were tied 1-1 after four overtimes Thursday night in the
third longest game in NHL history and the longest in 64 years.
</P>
<P>
   The only longer games were in the 1930s. Detroit beat the
Montreal Maroons 1-0 in an overtime that lasted 116 minutes, 30
seconds on March 24, 1936, and Toronto beat Boston 1-0 in an
overtime that lasted 104 minutes, 36 seconds on April 3, 1933.
</P>
<P>
   It became the longest game in Penguins history with 44 seconds
left in the fourth overtime. The previous longest was the Penguins'
3-2 victory over Washington on April 24, 1996, a game ended by Petr
Nedved's goal with 45 seconds left in the fourth overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Kovalev scored the Penguins' goal at 2:22 of the first
period before one of the NHL's most proficient offensive teams
slipped into an unaccustomed defensive mode in front of goaltender
Ron Tugnutt, who stopped 66 of the Flyers' first 67 shots. It was
the most shots ever against the Penguins and the most saves ever by
a Penguins goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, in danger of falling behind 3-1 in the best-of-seven
series, tied it on something of a fluke goal in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Previously 0-for-16 on the power play in the series, John
LeClair redirected Eric Desjardins' shot from the right point --
apparently, with his helmet -- past Tugnutt for his fifth goal of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens in long playoff games, each team took turns
dominating the offensive play in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers got nearly all of the good chances in the first
overtime, with Daymond Langkow missing off the crossbar with 30
seconds gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins subsequently had nearly all of the better chances
in the second overtime, with Kovalev missing off the right post at
1:40 -- exactly the same shot he missed in the Flyers' 4-3 overtime
victory in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The third overtime featured a rarity -- three power plays, two by
Pittsburgh, but neither team could score. The Flyers had six shots
during their power play and 13 in the third overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Jaromir Jagr, the offensive star of the first three games of the
series with five goals, was clearly off his game. He missed the
Penguins' pregame skate, complaining he did not feel well, and was
so fatigued at times he could barely stand on his skates.
</P>
<P>
   The longest previous Flyers overtime playoff game was a
two-overtime victory over St. Louis on April 16, 1968.

<HEADLINE> Legislators begin adopting budget  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislative leaders say they expect to
complete adoption of the 2000-01 state budget today -- 35 days after
the current fiscal year began.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly, which convened at 9 p.m. Thursday, approved
all of the 13 bills constituting the $77.5 billion spending plan at
2:10 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, the first of the two chambers to begin budget
adoption, adjourned Thursday evening after passing six budget
measures and planned to reconvene this morning to approve the
remaining bills.
</P>
<P>
   The state spending plan is for the fiscal year that began April
1, and though more than a month late, lawmakers were considering
the new budget as being almost on time. Last year, the budget
wasn't finished until Aug. 4, only hours before it would have
become the latest budget in state history.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 16th straight year New York's budget is late.
</P>
<P>
   Just before adjourning early this morning, Assembly Speaker
Sheldon drew laughter when he told his chamber, ''I think we can
begin the wind-down of this legislative session so that many of you
can see the sunshine this summer, perhaps with your constituents
rather than with each other in this chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers were initially expected to pass 11 bills
pertaining to the budget, but the state Assembly added two
supplemental bills due to technicalities, aides said. The two new
bills would also have to be adopted by the Senate for the process
to be complete.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget total was closer to Gov. George Pataki and the
Republican-led Senate's spending plans. The governor had proposed a
budget of $76.8 billion and the Senate approved spending $500
million more. Democrats who dominate the Assembly had passed a
resolution for a $78.2 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the budget represents nearly a 5 percent increase in
general fund spending -- money supported by taxpayers -- and just
under 6 percent in all funds from last year's spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first measures approved by both houses was to place a
record $3.8 billion transportation bond act before voters this
November. The bill sailed through the Senate without debate but was
met with some dissenting comments before passing in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are enacting some kind of a smoke and mirrors
budget. We should come to our fiscal senses ... so that the
majority of these projects could be paid in cash,'' said
Assemblyman William Parment, a Chautauqua County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Republican Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno
and Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver enjoyed cones of
''Budget Nut Crunch'' ice cream -- made up of vanilla, caramel swirl
and crunchy peanut brittle -- in front of photographers at the
Capitol. The snack was symbolic of the leaders' habit in earlier
years of working out disputes at an ice cream parlor near the state
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The last major hurdle for final passage of the budget appeared
to have been cleared Tuesday when the state leaders reached a deal
on a debt-reform plan that called for establishing a cap on new
debt and on debt service payments. Lawmakers agreed to statutorily
set the cap on new debt at 4 percent of personal income and the cap
on debt service at 5 percent of all state government funds, both
retroactive to April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced Thursday that the debt reform plan will also
reduce from 40 years to 30 years the maximum length of time the
state can borrow money for. In addition, the state would also
institute a ban on using debt as a ''fiscal gimmick'' -- like the
state's Cuomo-era move of ''selling'' Attica prison to itself so it
could borrow against the value of the prison -- and restrict the use
of debt for capital purposes only.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should save the taxpayers of this state tens of millions
of dollars,'' Bruno said before the debt reform package breezed
through his chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Another last-minute kink worked out Thursday involved the
withdrawal of a new interpretation of taxes on electricity by the
Pataki administration that big non-manufacturing users of power
like supermarkets complained could cost them $45 million this year.
The measure will save those companies $150 million a year when
fully implemented in four years, legislators said.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget would include $1.5 billion in tax-cut initiatives
over five years, with the pricetag for the first year at less than
$100 million. Under the deal, the state's gross receipts tax on
energy would be eliminated for large manufacturers and reduced for
small manufacturers and residential ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the budget would be a record $1.2 billion
increase in public school aid to an estimated $13.6 billion, the
highest level in state history. In higher education, $680 million
would be spent on an expanded Tuition Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state's prescription drug program for senior
citizens, ''EPIC,'' would be expanded from 115,000 to about 215,000
enrollees within three years. The starting date of the expansion
was set for Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with budget adoption would be the implementation of a
five-year $17.1 billion bridge- and road-building program and a
$17.1 billion New York City-area mass transit improvement program.
</P>
<P>
   Following budget adoption, lawmakers would resume receiving
their paychecks, which had been withheld since their first payday
in the new fiscal year on April 12. Under legislation approved at
the end of 1998, lawmakers' pay is suspended for as long as the
budget is late.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators get all their pay back, without interest, when
budget adoption is completed.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Expand Africa Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major trade bill moving through Congress
would elevate 48 nations of sub-Saharan Africa to full trading
partners and expand market access for Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the House Thursday by 309-110 and is expected to
win Senate approval next week. President Clinton said the vote was
a ''key milestone'' for a measure that would ''help developing
nations to lift their people out of poverty and create a more
secure world.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong House vote for free trade comes some two weeks before
the critical vote on whether to put U.S. trade relations with China
on a permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   The Africa bill, a House-Senate compromise months in the making,
was pushed hard by lawmakers who stressed that the United States
for too long has ignored the economic potential of the 700 million
people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 48 African countries have been begging for this type of
encouragement for investment, so they can get out of poverty,
increase their citizens' disposable income, and become true
partners with the United States,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York, top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have not been on our trade screen in the past,'' said
Ways and Means trade subcommittee head Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill.,
who has worked five years on the bill. He said it was a ''unique
opportunity to help the countries that are struggling''
economically.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, African nations that meet certain labor
and human rights standards would be free from duty and quotas when
selling Americans apparel made from U.S. yarn and fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel made in Africa from regional fabric would get up to a
1.5 percent share of the American market, up from 1.1 percent now,
with that share rising to 3.5 percent over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said that could
increase U.S. imports of African apparel made with African fabric
from the current $250 million -- a ''drop in the bucket'' -- to $923
million in 2000 and $4.2 billion in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest African countries, those with per capita gross
domestic products below $1,500, would for four years face no duties
or quotas for apparel made in Africa from third country fabric.
Bill sponsors said all but six African nations would qualify for
that category.
</P>
<P>
   The original House bill passed a year ago dealt only with
Africa. The Senate version added the Caribbean states, fulfilling a
commitment to give them parity with the benefits Mexico enjoys
under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said it had been a half-dozen years since there had
been such strong bipartisan support for a trade bill, and the vote
would ''provide some sense of positive momentum'' for what is
expected to be a much closer vote on China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the opposition were lawmakers from textile states who
argued that it would result in American jobs being lost and that
provisions to stop the shipping of articles from third countries
through Africa were not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''It imperils the livelihoods of thousands of U.S. textile
workers, it creates the opportunity for massive customs fraud,
turning sub-Saharan Africa into a transshipment superhighway,''
said Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., was angered by
the decision of House-Senate negotiators to drop her provision that
would have facilitated the sale of AIDS drugs to Africa. Feinstein
wrote Clinton a letter saying she needed to know the
administration's policy on AIDS drugs for Africa before she decides
how she will deal with the trade bill when it reaches the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 434.

<HEADLINE> Panel Votes To Lift Cuba Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm groups that want to sell food to Cuba
have initiated a new battle in Congress over weakening the
four-decades-old U.S. economic embargo on the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   A House Appropriations Committee subcommittee approved
legislation Thursday that would permit exports of food and medicine
to Cuba so long as they are not subsidized by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which was attached to an annual appropriations bill
for the Agriculture Department, also would prohibit the president
from including food and medicine in future embargoes of other
countries without congressional approval. The measure was approved
on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who oppose the embargo said they hope to attach the
Cuba measure to the Senate's version of the USDA spending bill. The
Senate overwhelmingly approved a similar Cuba measure last year,
but it was later killed after Cuban-American critics of Cuban
President Fidel Castro prevailed on House Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is critically important to our farmers. We ought to have
this debate,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   A leading defender of the embargo, GOP Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart
of Florida, circulated a letter to House colleagues Thursday
asserting that Castro ''is oppressing the Cuban people more than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart said in an interview that he is counting on the GOP
leadership to maintain its support for the embargo. ''It's not over
until the fat lady sings. She hasn't even begun to warm up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the legislation's chances could be complicated by the
furor in Florida over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy that the
Clinton administration is seeking to return to his father in Cuba
over the objections of his Florida relatives. Republicans have been
critical of the administration's handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The administration last year lifted sanctions on exports of food
and medicine to three other countries listed as terrorist states --
Iran, Libya and Sudan -- but was barred by federal law from
including Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Cuban embargo say Cuba can't afford to buy
U.S. food unless it's subsidized by the Agriculture Department, but
farm groups insist that Cuba may save enough in shipping costs by
buying American food to make up for the lack of federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba currently buys about 700,000 metric tons of wheat a year,
mostly from Europe and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said it was unfair to block sales of
food to Cuba when Congress is considering permanent normal trade
relations with China, which also has been criticized for its human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot be for one and not the other,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Governor Reaching Out  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER WILLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- When Gov. George Ryan hit the road this
week, he was looking to reach out to the people of Illinois after
weeks of scandal. At the first stop of the goodwill tour, a
protester smacked Ryan in the face with a cream pie.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of year for the first-term Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's former employees admit to taking bribes and a close
friend is charged with covering up the scheme. A new system for
delivering child-support checks fails, delaying checks to tens of
thousands of parents and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Popular at the state Capitol, he pushes through a $12 billion
program to rebuild schools and roads but everyone focuses on the
taxes required to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got incompetence, illegality and higher taxes. What could
be worse?'' said Chris Mooney, a political science professor at the
University of Illinois at Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   The result is rock-bottom approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   One poll found 65 percent of voters rejected Ryan's claim that
he did not know the extent of bribery within the secretary of
state's office, which he ran for eight years before being elected
governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old governor has a growing national profile. Last
fall, Ryan spent five days in Cuba in the first trip by a U.S.
governor to the communist nation since the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   He has also won praise for halting executions in Illinois over
concerns that innocent people were being sent to death row. Yet the
issue received only polite applause at Ryan's forums this week; his
work has been seen by some as an attempt to divert attention from
his woes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think he's guilty,'' said Steve Stevenson, a retired
barber and Democrat who showed up at Ryan's first town hall-style
meeting. ''I think he's down here just to smooth feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of Ryan's troubles is a federal investigation of
state workers granting driver's licenses in exchange for bribes.
Investigators say hundreds of people paid bribes to pass written
exams and road tests -- including Ricardo Guzman, the driver of a
truck involved in a 1994 wreck in Wisconsin that killed six
children.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also say at least $170,000 in bribe money was
passed along to Ryan's campaign fund. Ryan says he didn't know the
money was being donated to his campaign and certainly did not
encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has not been accused of wrongdoing. But 31 people have been
indicted and, so far, 25 have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent to be charged is Dean Bauer, Ryan's longtime
friend and inspector general in the secretary of state's office.
Instead of investigating corruption, Bauer covered it up and
obstructed justice to protect Ryan, prosecutors allege.
</P>
<P>
   Forum audiences have not asked Ryan about the scandal, but they
have created other headaches.
</P>
<P>
   A college student at the first meeting hit Ryan with a pie to
protest his handling of problems on a university governor board. At
the second meeting, protesters unfurled a banner calling for his
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan shrugged off the incidents -- the pie ''didn't taste too
bad,'' he joked -- but they dominated news stories that he had hoped
would describe a governor in touch with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brenda Calvert gave Ryan credit for showing up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he showed a lot of guts, taking any and every
question,'' said Calvert, a teacher who attended the first forum.
''I didn't necessarily believe all the answers he gave, but it
showed guts.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wraps Up Education Tour  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- President Clinton wrapped up a two-day
education tour with a plug for Vice President Al Gore, who is
unveiling a campaign proposal on improving teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   During a round-table discussion here Thursday, Clinton was asked
whether Gore, were he to be elected president in November, planned
to continue many of the policies he has advocated, from charter
schools to smaller class sizes and school uniforms. Gore was to
deliver an address on teacher quality today in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been working very hard on it,'' Clinton said of Gore's
speech. He said the vice president wanted to see a share of the
federal surplus go toward teacher hiring and training.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came and talked to me about this,'' Clinton said. ''It was
entirely his idea, not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the earlier question, Clinton said Gore was in a position
to offer far more, in terms of vision on education, than he can.
''He can look four years beyond what I can argue for,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long round table at Eastgate Elementary School capped a
day in which Clinton defended the idea of charter schools and
declared that providing a first-class public education was ''a
national security issue for America,'' as more immigrant children
fill the nation's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   He praised local government and community leaders for coming
together to focus on improving schools in Columbus, where reforms
are just getting under way. ''Their strategy ... of investing more
and demanding more is working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the round table, Clinton spoke by phone for 10 minutes
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, then returned to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During his tour, which in addition to Columbus included stops in
Kentucky, Iowa and Minnesota, Clinton directed the Education
Department to develop national guidelines for participation by
businesses and religious organizations in charter schools. He also
announced $16 million in new money and the continuation of $121
million in previously awarded grants for charter schools
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Senate Republicans used their majority power to
advance a GOP measure that would give states more discretion in
their use of federal education funds. At the same time, they
rejected a Democratic alternative to target funds for more teachers
and smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advocates national standards and charter schools, which
are public schools created by parents and teachers and run with
exemptions from many state laws and regulations.

<HEADLINE> Government requests gag order in Pirro case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The two sides in the Albert Pirro tax
fraud trial are accusing each other of trying to influence the jury
pool, and the prosecution is requesting a gag order to end it all.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors asked Judge Barrington Parker on Thursday to
ban all parties, attorneys and other representatives from making
any comments to reporters until the trial is over. It's scheduled
to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed that Pirro, husband of Westchester County District
Attorney Jeanine Pirro, was trying to influence the jury pool with
complaints about political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro and his lawyers claim that prosecutors are the ones trying
to influence jurors -- by bringing the name of his wife, Westchester
County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, into the case. Albert Pirro
said at a news conference last week that when prosecutors called
his wife's 1993 car loan a sham designed to cover his tax fraud,
they were ''trying to create ... artificial issues to inflame and
influence the jury.'' His lawyers repeated the claim in papers
filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, a successful real-estate lawyer, Republican lobbyist and
fund-raiser, blamed the case on ''the Clinton administration's
investigative tactics into campaigns that are being run by
Republicans'' and said his wife would have been a GOP candidate for
higher office had she not been sideswiped by investigations of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Westchester know what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in their letter to Parker, prosecutors Elliott Jacobson and
Cathy Seibel defended the mention of Mrs. Pirro, who is not accused
of any wrongdoing. They said the government has to mention family
members to prove that items Albert Pirro claimed as business
deductions were actually for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   And they said Albert Pirro's comments were part of ''an obvious
effort to influence the jury pool by trumpeting at press
conferences and in press interviews positions his attorney has said
he will not raise at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirro's lead defense lawyer, Gustave Newman, said in court last
week that he would not argue that Pirro was a victim of ''selective
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Pirro lawyer, Robert Giuffra, said Thursday he had no
reaction to the request for a gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro and his brother Anthony, who was his accountant,
allegedly claimed about $1 million in business deductions for what
were actually Albert's personal expenses. Albert Pirro says he has
paid all the back taxes and blames his brother for improper tax
returns. His brother blames him for providing little or no guidance
on which expenses were proper business deductions.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word from the judge on when he might rule on the
gag order.

<HEADLINE> More Rocket Attacks in Israel  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Rockets fell on northern Israel
Friday for a second day, and army radio reported casualties.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Lebanese Shiite Muslim guerrillas had unleashed
their fiercest rocket attack in nearly a year on northern Israel,
killing an Israeli soldier, wounding 26 other people and raising
fears of more attacks once Israel withdraws its troops from
southern Lebanon this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The radio report on the latest attack said rockets fell in the
border town of Shlomi, in Israel's northern Galilee region. It gave
no details about casualties. Israel radio said fires broke out.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiryat Shemona, the biggest border town, residents were
ordered back into shelters.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday evening's attack, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
hinted that Israel's response would be harsh and sustained,
indicating that residents along the border might have to spend a
long time in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah claimed responsibility for Thursday's rocketing, in
response to ''continuing aggression on villages'' in south Lebanon
by Israel and its allies. Two Lebanese women were killed in
shelling earlier Thursday in south Lebanon, which Israel said was
carried out by its allied militia, the South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was in a meeting with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross, who is in
Israel to try to move along negotiations with the Palestinians,
when they were interrupted with word of the attack Thursday
evening. In Washington, the State Department expressed concern and
said it regretted loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 wounded in Thursday's attack, only five were admitted
to a hospital. Some had cuts from shrapnel and flying glass, while
most complained of shock.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy mayor Yitzhak Kakon called for a stern Israeli response,
''not dribs and drabs.'' He said life in his city has become
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rocket attack was the most serious since June 24,
when two civilians were killed. In February, residents were ordered
into shelters for two nights amid tensions along the border.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 2, Penguins 1, 5 OT  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Keith Primeau, the man who could never seem to
score in the playoffs, ended the third longest game in NHL history
early Friday morning by scoring at 12:01 of the fifth overtime to
give the exhausted Philadelphia Flyers a memorable 2-1 victory over
the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau, who had only seven previous goals in 78 career playoff
games, carried the puck along the right wing boards, put a move on
defenseman Darius Kasparaitis and powered a wrist shot past Ron
Tugnutt, who had stopped 70 of the Flyers' first 71 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended at 2:35 a.m. EDT, exactly seven hours after it
started, with more than one-third of the 17,148 fans still in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers won both games in Pittsburgh to even at 2-2 an
Eastern Conference semifinal series in which the home team has yet
to win. Game 4 is Sunday afternoon in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The only longer games were in the 1930s. Detroit beat the
Montreal Maroons 1-0 in an overtime that lasted 116 minutes, 30
seconds on March 24, 1936, and Toronto beat Boston 1-0 in an
overtime that lasted 104 minutes, 36 seconds on April 3, 1933.
</P>
<P>
   It became the longest game in Penguins history with 44 seconds
left in the fourth overtime. The previous longest was the Penguins'
3-2 victory over Washington on April 24, 1996, a game ended by Petr
Nedved's goal with 45 seconds left in the fourth overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Kovalev, one of the Penguins' most dangerous but
enigmatic players, did in Game 4 what he nearly did Tuesday -- give
the Penguins the early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev, the last player off the ice during the Penguins'
morning skate, powered a slap shot from the high slot past Brian
Boucher's glove 2:22 into the game. Boucher, a rookie, did not
allow another goal, stopping 57 of 58 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev caught the puck off Robert Lang's stick with his hand
and adeptly directed it to his stick for his first goal in the
Penguins' nine playoff games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins were 4-0 in the playoffs when scoring first, but
they couldn't sustain their early offensive momentum and, caught up
in an unaccustomed defensive game, finally lost the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, scoreless on their first 16 power plays of the
series, finally scored on their 17th. Daymond Langkow won a faceoff
in the Penguins' end that went to Eric Desjardins, whose slap shot
from the point was redirected into the net by John LeClair just as
he was losing his balance in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair's stick was pointed in the air when he shot, and the
goal was reviewed to determine if the stick was above the crossbar
when he redirected it. However, the replay judges said the video
was inconclusive, and did not overrule it. The puck apparently hit
defenseman Bob Boughner's stick before deflecting off LeClair's
helmet and past Tugnutt.

<HEADLINE> Air Bag Safety Rule Changes Sought  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children and small women will be better
protected from inflating air bags, Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater says of an overhaul of the federal government's air bag
standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Under new rules to be announced today, automakers would be
required to perform tests using an entire ''family'' of auto
dummies, including 1-, 3- and 6-year-old children and a small
woman, as well as an average size man.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulations attempt to recreate real-world conditions by
specifying that child dummies be placed in child seats on the
passenger seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and
lying positions.
</P>
<P>
	   ''This rulemaking continues our extensive series of actions
designed to preserve the benefits of air bags and decrease the
potential hazard for children and small adults,'' Slater said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The rule allows for a 25 mph crash test, which the auto industry
promoted as a standard that will protect smaller passengers who can
be seriously injured or killed when the bag inflates at low speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, air bags have killed 158 children and small adults,
most who were not wearing seat belts and traveling at slower speeds
when they crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to the deaths, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration reduced its 30 mph testing standard, allowing
automakers to use a 25 mph test that results in air bags that
deploy with less force. Federal data shows that air bag deaths have
declined sharply for vehicles made since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Some consumer groups wanted a return to the 30 mph standard that
would result in more powerful air bags, which they say could be
combined with advanced technology to stop them from inflating at
lower crash speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   ''The people who have been killed by air bags in low-speed
crashes were killed by cut-rate air bags that manufacturers
installed years ago to save money,'' safety group Public Citizen
said in a statement criticizing the rule. ''Technology has existed
for years to ensure that air bags do not injure smaller-statured
people in low-speed crashes, but few manufacturers used it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Auto officials dispute that it is a matter of cost, saying that
customers demand safer products.
</P>
<P>
	   From Sept. 1, 2003, to Aug. 31, 2006, increasing percentages of
motor vehicles will be required to meet requirements for reducing
air bag risks, either by automatically turning off the air bag in
the presence of young children or deploying the air bag in a manner
much less likely to cause serious or fatal injury, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a second stage phase-in from Sept. 1, 2007, to Aug. 31,
2010, the maximum test speed for unbelted average-size dummies will
increase from 30 mph to 35 mph in tests for increasing percentages
of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   The department's interim final rule could change after a period
of public comment and reaction to the slower speed test.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Music copyright issue was not a close call  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer demand for a business idea is not a
license to ignore copyright laws, a judge concluded as he explained
why he gave the nation's major record companies a victory over
Internet-based music service MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jed S. Rakoff in a 10-page opinion filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan told why he issued a one-page order
last Friday in favor of the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected several legal arguments by MP3.com, including a
claim that the company does not violate copyrights but instead
provides a useful service to consumers who otherwise would be
served by ''pirates'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stripped to its essence, defendant's 'consumer protection'
argument amounts to nothing more than a bald claim that defendants
should be able to misappropriate plaintiffs' property simply
because there is a consumer demand for it,'' Rakoff wrote. ''This
hardly appeals to the conscience of equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff said it ''is clear'' that MP3.com has infringed the
copyrights of Sony Music Entertainment Inc., Warner Bros. Records
Inc., Arista Records Inc., Atlantic Recordings Corp., Capitol
Records Inc. and others.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial ruling Friday caused the value of MP3.com's
stock to fall by more than 30 percent, the stock has since
recovered as the company suggested it would eventually reach a
settlement with the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Richards, president of the San Diego-based company, said
there were no surprises in the written decision, which will be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The marketplace is moving beyond the speed that the courts can
digest it today,'' he said. ''It's time to get all this stuff out
of the courts and into the boardroom and continue what has been
very good negotiations to arrive at a business resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the number of dollars to be paid to the record companies
did not dominate negotiations as much as how to ''blend this old
world and new world together'' to benefit artists, record
companies, MP3.com and the consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very upbeat about what's going to happen with MP3.com
and the labels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, MP3.com's chief executive officer, has said
the judge was criticizing a new product that accounts for only 4
percent of the company's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com's Instant Listening Service and Beam-it program
ultimately are aimed at allowing customers to access their music at
anytime on any device connected to the Internet, whether it be a
hand-held computer or a telephone, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote that MP3.com infringed on the copyrights when it
purchased tens of thousands of popular CDs and then copied the
recordings onto its computer servers so it could replay them for
its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected the company's argument that it did not
violate copyright law because it required subscribers to prove they
already own the CD version of the recordings by briefly inserting
them into their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff said this practice was not the functional equivalent of
storing its subscribers CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In actuality, defendant is re-playing for the subscribers
converted versions of the recordings it copied, without
authorization, from plaintiffs' copyrighted CDs,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He said MP3.com was simply repackaging the recordings to
transmit them through a new medium, invading the right of the
record companies to license their copyright sound recordings to
others for reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was not persuaded by MP3.com's argument that the
record companies will benefit from having their music played over a
new medium.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution and the Copyright Act give companies with
copyrights the right ''to curb the development of such a derivative
market by refusing to license a copyrighted work or by doing so
only on terms the copyright owner finds acceptable,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Layoffs follow breakdown in talks with police union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Twenty-five of the city's 346 police
officers lost their jobs today after a breakdown in budget
negotiations between the mayor and the city's police union.
</P>
<P>
   The city is facing a large shortfall stemming from the
bankruptcy of a private company that had been used to help collect
taxes. In the first two years of the contract, the company had
guaranteed an estimated $7 million lost when the city collected
only 93 percent of its taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Without the company's guarantee, the city will not recoup any
uncollected taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for what could be a several million dollar hole in
the budget Mayor Philip Giordano issued pink slips to 170 municipal
employees last month, including the 25 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have estimated the police layoffs will save the
city $21,368 a week, or more than $1.11 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The city and police union had been negotiating several
concessions to avoid those job cuts, which went into effect today.
The talks broke down Thursday morning, about 20 minutes before the
union leadership had planned to present a concessions package to
union members for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had been talking, trying to work out a deal, and the city
wanted many more concessions than we were willing to give at this
time,'' said Detective Paul Ariola, president of the Waterbury
Police Union Local 1237. ''The concessions were cutting into the
contract, and that's what the concern was.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano blamed the breakdown in negotiations on the union. He
said they had agreed to consider concessions only if they were tied
to another five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said he had promised the union that he would not lay
off any officers if they agreed to work overtime and holidays for
straight pay through the end of the fiscal year and increase the
number of squads in the department. Changing the number of squads
from three to seven would mean fewer officers would be off duty on
any given day, reducing overtime costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The change in the number of squads would not effect the amount
of officers on patrol but would simply reduce the overtime by
$10,000 a week,'' Giordano said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officers said Thursday that the layoffs in the
department have morale at an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people we've worked with for two years that
everybody has developed relationships with, and now we're not going
to see them anymore,'' said Officer Wendy Perrone, a bike officer
who has been on the job about 11 years. ''They're like our family,
and they're very good officers.''

17 Reported Dead in Indonesian Quake
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from a powerful earthquake that
struck in central Indonesia increased to 17 Friday as remote areas began
reporting casualties, the military said. The 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 11:21
a.m. Thursday, damaging hundreds of homes and buildings along a wide stretch of
eastern Sulawesi and the offshore islands of Peleng and Banggai. An officer at
the military station in Luwuk, a town on the eastern coast of central Sulawesi,

FDA Warns Company on Cancer Drug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government regulators are telling Celgene Corp. to stop
promoting the infamous drug thalidomide as a cancer fighter, a use that hasn't
been approved. In a warning letter dated April 21, the Food and Drug
Administration gave the pharmaceutical company until Friday to cease its
promotions. Thalidomide was given to pregnant women in Europe in the 1960s to
treat morning sickness. It was banned worldwide after causing 12,000 babies to
be born with serious birth defects, including flipper-like arms. The drug became
available in the United States for the first time in 1998 when the FDA approved
it as a leprosy treatment.

<HEADLINE> Recreational Use of Ritalin Feared  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Its street names include ''Vitamin R'' and
''R-Ball,'' and federal drug enforcers list it among the 
ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities fear Ritalin is becoming increasingly popular as a
recreational drug among teens and pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an area of concern,'' said Rogene Waite, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ''It has the
potential for abuse, so we would be looking at that and we'll
continue to monitor it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some psychiatrists point out that there are no definitive
studies on the extent of any abuse and that Ritalin is milder than
other stimulants. Even so, the DEA lists Ritalin, also known as
methylphenidate or MPH, as one the agency's ''drugs of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A significant amount of data from school surveys, emergency
room reports, poison control centers, adolescent drug treatment and
law enforcement encounters all indicate a growing problem with the
abuse of MPH among school children,'' Gretchen Feussner, a DEA
pharmacologist, wrote in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Lake Zurich Middle School North had heard
about Ritalin abuse in the community for almost three years,
Principal Philip Zarob said. But they did not know of abuse within
the school until a teacher spotted two students passing something
in a restroom last month.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 15 students have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The case is not uncommon, according to the DEA. The agency cited
a 1997 Indiana University survey of 44,232 students that included a
question about the non-medical use of Ritalin. Nearly 7 percent of
high school students surveyed reported using Ritalin recreationally
at least once in the previous year, and 2.5 percent reported using
it monthly or more often.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA also counted nearly 2,000 cases of methylphenidate theft
from January 1990 to May 1995 -- ranking the drug among the top 10
controlled pharmaceuticals most frequently reported stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, emergency room admissions studied by the federal
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found
that in 1995 and 1996, patients ages 10 to 14 were just as likely
to mention methylphenidate as cocaine in a drug-related emergency
room episode. Nearly 75 percent said they had been using the drug
for psychic effects or recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., the maker of Ritalin, said in a
statement that millions of ADHD patients have been treated safely
using the drug.

<HEADLINE> SF Chronicle Cuts Prices  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Price wars are coming to San Francisco Bay
area newspaper racks, while a federal judge considers whether The
Hearst Corp. would damage competition by buying the San Francisco
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a circulation decline and an expanded presence in the
city by the San Jose Mercury News, the Chronicle announced Thursday
that it will cut its newsstand price from 50 cents to 25 cents next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News said last month that it would lower its San
Francisco price from 35 to 25 cents, enlarge its San Francisco
staff and publish a daily section devoted to the city. Another area
newspaper, The Contra Costa Times, will match the Chronicle's new
price reduction, said publisher George Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's price cut is designed ''to make us more
competitive with other newspapers,'' said Patricia Hoyt, marketing
manager for the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which publishes
both the Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported a 2.2 percent drop in circulation for a
six-month period ending in September.
</P>
<P>
   The cost cut was announced as testimony continued in U.S.
District Court in the trial of an antitrust lawsuit challenging
Hearst's proposed $660 million purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by Clint Reilly, a real estate investor
and former mayoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He contends Hearst and the Chronicle destroyed the prospect of
head-to-head competition by San Francisco-based papers by
pre-empting other potential Chronicle buyers and paying a local
publisher to take over the Examiner in an inadequately subsidized
deal designed to ensure the paper's failure.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has complicated Hearst's plans to merge the staffs of
the Chronicle and Examiner by August, when Ted Fang was to take
over publication of the Examiner with a staff that has yet to be
hired.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, an investment banker who supervised the
Chronicle Publishing Co.'s efforts to sell the newspaper and its
other properties last year testified that there were three other
bidders for the Chronicle: Knight Ridder Corp., publisher of the
Mercury News and the Contra Costa Times; Gannett Corp., whose
newspapers include the Marin Independent Journal; and Times-Mirror
Corp., publisher of the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett and Times-Mirror both offered around $500 million and
Knight Ridder offered around $450 million, said Jill Greenthal, a
partner in Boston-based banking firm. She said Hearst first offered
$565 million, the Chronicle board asked for $700 million and they
settled on $660 million
</P>
<P>
   Any buyer except Hearst would be subject to the restrictions of
the joint operating agreement, which has been in effect since 1965.
The arrangement allows the Chronicle and Examiner to maintain
separate editorial staffs but combine business operations and
divide profits.

<HEADLINE> Co. Warns of Cancer Drug Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pharmaceutical maker Genentech Inc. has
warned doctors that the breast cancer drug Herceptin is linked to
15 deaths and 47 other adverse reactions in patients.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to doctors sent Thursday, the company said the
adverse effects included allergic shock and extreme respiratory
distress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent the letter to oncologists to heighten their awareness
and educate them about infrequent adverse events that can occur in
certain patients,'' Genentech spokesman Neil Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 23,000 patients have been treated with Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Severe reactions to Herceptin had not occurred in clinical
trials before the drug gained Food and Drug Administration approval
in 1998, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes reactions can't be foreseen in trials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times you might see some safety issues once the drug
gets put into a larger patient population,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he didn't know when the company first heard of the
deaths and reactions, but analysis had confirmed the link to
Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   In nine of the 15 deaths, symptoms arose within 24 hours of the
time Herceptin was administered, according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech is working with the FDA to have the drug's label
amended to reflect the new risks, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is used to treat breast cancer patients that have too
many copies of the HER2 gene. A healthy version of this gene
produces a protein that signals cells to grow and multiply
normally. But in women with too much HER2, the breast cells
reproduce out of control and spread throughout the body. Herceptin,
an antibody, blocks excess HER2, shrinking and eliminating tumors.

<HEADLINE> Court again sides with adult business vs. New York City  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A topless club in Manhattan is not an
''adult establishment'' within the meaning of New York City's
ordinance which seeks to zone sex-oriented businesses out of
residential and popular tourist areas of the city, a court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals unanimously ruled Thursday that the VIP
Club does not fall under the zoning law, which defines adult
businesses as those with a ''substantial portion'' of their floor
space devoted to sex-oriented materials or activities.
</P>
<P>
   The definition is crucial to whether the VIP Club can stay at
its current location at West 20th Street. The city argued that
''any'' sexual-related activities at the VIP Club or other topless
clubs or X-rated theaters subjects them to the zoning ordinance,
the Court of Appeals noted.
</P>
<P>
   The law aims to consign businesses peddling sexually explicit
materials to industrially zoned areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The VIP Club argued that the same definition should apply to it
as has been used to describe what an adult bookstore is in the city
-- if 40 percent or more of its floor space is devoted to
sex-oriented merchandise. The VIP Club said it only offers topless
dancing on a mezzanine visible by less than 36 percent of its floor
space and it otherwise defines itself as an ''upscale cabaret with
topless entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   In its unsigned, unanimous ruling Thursday, the Court of Appeals
-- the state's highest court -- said the VIP Club was right. To rule
in the city's favor would cause the ''substantial portion''
component of the city's zoning ordinance to be ignored where any
adult-oriented entertainment was offered in eating and drinking
establishments, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling affirmed two lower court rulings about the
''substantial portion'' question.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the VIP Club's owners, Dezer Properties, Inc.,
called the decision ''another victory for First Amendment,
freedom-of-expression rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This will put an end to the city's heavy handed efforts to
close the VIP,'' Simon Rothkrug said. ''It is really a victory for
all topless clubs and adult theaters in the city of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fishner, New York City's criminal justice coordinator,
said the ruling ''frustrates the obvious intent of the law by
making it possible for some businesses to evade the law's clear
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue vigorous enforcement and we will consider
legislative changes to insure that our residences, schools and
places of worship remain far from the shadows cast by strip clubs
and other adult businesses,'' Fishner said.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Court of Appeals sided with an adult
bookstore specializing in gay materials, Les Hommes, in another
challenge to the meaning of the 1995 sex shop zoning ordinance. In
that decision, the court upheld the 40 percent rule and rejected
city arguments that some adult bookstores were offering non-adult
materials in a ''sham'' compliance with the zoning ordinance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, with the key index in Taipei surging by more than 3
percent on bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Markets were closed in Japan, South Korea and Thailand for
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan share prices soared after after many institutional
investors returned to the market amid the belief that stocks have
been oversold in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about a loan scandal involving the Chung Shing Bank have
also eased after Taiwan's Finance Minister Paul Chiu on Thursday
called on banks to help cash-strapped companies. Chung Shing is
under investigation for allegedly making improper loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Taipei exchange's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 273.15
points, 3.2 percent, to 8,698.53.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian shares also closed higher on foreign buying of
selective stocks. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip
stocks, closed at 925.45, up 18.78 points, or 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the trend was the Hong Kong Exchange, where the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index slipped 45.43 points, or 0.3 percent, to
close at 15,268.64. On Thursday, the index had slumped 263.40
points, or 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said trading was thin in Hong Kong as investors were
awaiting for the release later Friday of U.S. economic figures,
which could determine whether there would a hefty rise in U.S.
interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Any increase in U.S. interest rates is usually followed by a
similar rise in Hong Kong because the Hong Kong dollar is linked to
the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   MANILA: Philippine stocks slipped as clashes in the southern
Philippines between government troops and Muslim rebels continued
to undermine investor confidence. The 30-company Philippine Stock
Exchange Index fell 1.44 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,551.90, a
new low since the index closed at 1,523.98 on Oct. 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 26.20 points, or 1.3 percent,
to 2,047.51.
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed higher on broad gains
with banks leading the market in the wake of recent strong
earnings. The All Ordinaries Index rose 49.7 points, or 1.6
percent, to 3,075.6.

<HEADLINE> Europe Bank Chief Reassures on Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- In an unusual statement directed to
''European citizens'' instead of financial markets, the head of the
European Central Bank said Friday that consumers shouldn't worry
about the euro's recent decline and promised the bank will
''continue to do all it can'' to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand their concerns, since a persistently lower euro
exchange rate might ultimately lead to higher prices in the shops.
It may also undermine the perception of the euro as a stable
currency,'' Wim Duisenberg said in statement. ''Therefore, we at
the ECB monitor the euro exchange rate very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to counter risks to price stability the ECB has over
the past six months taken measures and increased interest rates
four times already. It will continue to do all it can to maintain
price stability in the euro area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement comes a day after the euro plunged to an all-time
low of 88.45 cents against the dollar on Thursday, along with
declines against the pound, yen and Swiss franc. The currency for
the 11 euro nations has seen a steady decline since peaking at
$1.18 just days after its introduction on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB had earlier said that the exchange rate was of little
concern and didn't affect its main goal of controlling inflation.
But as the euro's slide has continued, bank leaders in recent
months have started saying that it could become a risk to price
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg reassured Europeans that prices were still stable
within the euro area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed, over the last decades there have been few periods in
which prices have been stable for so long. This internal stability
of the euro means that people can be confident that their savings
and pensions will keep their value over time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''European citizens can be assured that the future of the euro
is that of a strong currency, based on price stability and the
strength of the European economy.''

   Jobless Rate Falls to 3.9 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surging economy pushed the nation's
unemployment rate down to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in
April as 340,000 workers found jobs. The jobless rates for blacks
and Hispanics plunged to record monthly lows. The
bigger-than-expected drop in the jobless rate followed a 4.1
percent rate in March, the Labor Department said today. Many
analysts were expecting April's unemployment rate to fall to 4
percent. April's rate was the lowest since January 1970, when it
also stood at 3.9 percent. The 340,00 jobs added to business
payrolls in April was stronger than the 315,000 jobs many analysts
expected.

   ''ILOVEYOU'' Copycats Feared

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer systems around the world were infected
yesterday as a virus, proclaiming ''ILOVEYOU'' in the subject line
of an e-mail, overwhelmed networks and burrowed into computer hard
drives, destroying files containing precious photos and video.
Antivirus experts said the initial outbreak seemed to be slowing,
but warned that copycat versions were already making the rounds. By
some estimates, the original ''love bug'' infected tens of millions
of computers worldwide, not only spreading by e-mail like last
year's Melissa virus, but through instant messaging systems that
let people chat on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Air France Cancels Paris Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French national carrier Air France canceled half
its flights out of the Paris region's Charles de Gaulle and Orly
airports on Friday as stewards and air hostesses went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of flights in between other French cities, and
between European cities and French points except Paris, were
running normally, Air France said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was expected to continue through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Six trade unions called the strike to protest management
proposals concerning the number of vacation days to be awarded to
employees under a law to shorten the working week.
</P>
<P>
   France's left-of-center government has passed a controversial
law cutting the working week from 39 hours to 35. The law is a
centerpiece of its drive to create jobs, but many business leaders
are fiercely opposed to the measure. They say it is expensive and
smacks of government interference in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Trade unions in different sectors have also opposed elements of
the implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with more than 20 staffers were required to implement
the policy on as of this past Feb. 1, but businesses with fewer
than 20 employees have until January 2002.

<HEADLINE> PRECEDE Philadelphia  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Almost a year after Ralph Natale began
cooperating with prosecutors, the former mob boss was prepared to
plead guilty to a life of crime that included murder, extortion,
gambling and drug distribution, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael R. Stiles filed a criminal information
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia that implicated
Natale, 66, in two 1970s murders and the slayings of five others in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal information is used to bring charges when a defendant
has waived the right to a grand jury indictment and agreed to plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A plea hearing scheduled for 8:30 a.m. today in U.S. Distirict
Court in Camden was delayed and expected to begin at about 10:30
a.m. Federal prosecutors would not comment on the case Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents accused Natale of orchestrating a racketeering
conspiracy that included murder, extortion, illegal gambling, drug
trafficking, stolen cars, loan sharking and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Natale's attorney, Marc Neff, did not return phone calls seeking
comment Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The filing came as no surprise since Natale has been cooperating
with investigators about mob activities in Philadelphia and
southern New Jersey since last summer when he was arrested on drug
charges. He is believed to be the highest ranking mobster ever to
cooperate with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Natale's help led to the indictment of reputed mob boss Joseph
''Skinny Joey'' Merlino and 10 others in March on charges of
murder, attempted murder, racketeering, extortion, and illegal
gambling. Natale, who ran the mob between 1994 and 1998, allegedly
appointed Merlino boss in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A recent 19-count indictment of Camden Mayor Milton Milan also
alleged Natale and mob associates ''made direct payments of money
and other benefits'' to Milan, including cash bribes, vacations,
automobiles and home improvement work.
</P>
<P>
   The information filed Thursday linked Natale and other
unidentified members of La Cosa Nostra with the murders of William
Veasey, Anthony Turra and others along with the 1993 attempted
murder of John Stanfa, who headed a rival faction, and Joseph
Ciancaglini Jr., Stanfa's underboss.
</P>
<P>
   Turra, whose son allegedly headed a drug gang, was shot to death
in 1998 as he left his South Philadelphia home for the federal
courthouse in Philadelphia, where he was on trial for plotting to
kill Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   Veasey was gunned down in 1995 in front of his South
Philadelphia home on the morning his brother John was scheduled to
begin testifying in a federal mob racketeering case.
</P>
<P>
   The information said Natale also participated in the 1973 murder
of Philadelphia union leader Joey McGreal. Natale had long been
suspected of being a part of a mob hit squad that killed McGreal
because he was trying to get involved in organized crime's control
of the local bartenders' union.
</P>
<P>
   After 24 years in the organization, Natale took over the mob in
1994 following his release from prison on racketeering and drug
charges. He was arrested by federal marshals in June 1998 and
charged with parole violations.
</P>
<P>
   While still in prison, Natale was indicted in June 1999 with
conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamines in
Philadelphia and New Jersey in a scheme that dated to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A taped conversation once recorded Natale as boasting: ''There's
only one boss in Philadelphia ... that's Ralph Natale and that's
where the (expletive) it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   The expected plea shows how far the Philadelphia mob has
declined since the glory days in the 1960s and 1970s, when ''Docile
Don'' Angelo Bruno ruled with a firm hand and kept the violence
largely out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Philadelphia mob has been in the sick bed for a long
time,'' Temple University professor Nikos Passas, an expert in
organized crime, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bruno was gunned down in a car in front of his home in
1980, violence and racketeering prosecutions have decimated his
successors. Authorities say 24 mob members have been imprisoned and
at least 15 were killed over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a federal jury convicted boss Nicodemo ''Little Nicky''
Scarfo and 16 associates on racketeering charges. Stanfa took over
in 1990 and ruled over tumultuous years of fighting between his
organization and a faction headed by Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors won racketeering convictions for Stanfa and
seven others in 1995. Natale then took over, appointing Merlino as
underboss.

<HEADLINE> Feds Announce New Air Bag Rules  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children and smaller adults will be better
protected from inflating air bags under an overhaul of the federal
government's standards for the safety equipment, Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said today.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new rule that takes effect with the 2004 model year,
automakers will be required to perform tests using an entire
''family'' of auto dummies, including 1-, 3- and 6-year-old
children and a small woman, as well as an average-size man.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations attempt to recreate real-world conditions by
specifying that child dummies be placed in child seats on the
passenger seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and
lying positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This rulemaking continues our extensive series of actions
designed to preserve the benefits of air bags and decrease the
potential hazard for children and small adults,'' Slater said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The rule also calls for a 25 mph crash test, which the auto
industry promotes as a standard that will protect smaller
passengers. Since 1990, air bags have killed 158 children and small
adults, most unbelted and involved in low-speed crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the deaths, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration reduced its 30 mph testing standard, issuing a
temporary rule allowing automakers to use a 25 mph test that
results in air bags that deploy with less force. Federal data shows
air bag deaths have declined sharply for vehicles made since then.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups wanted a return to the 30 mph standard that
would result in more powerful air bags, which they say could be
combined with advanced technology to stop them from inflating at
lower crash speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who have been killed by air bags in low-speed
crashes were killed by cut-rate air bags that manufacturers
installed years ago to save money,'' safety group Public Citizen
said in a statement criticizing the rule. ''Technology has existed
for years to ensure that air bags do not injure smaller-statured
people in low-speed crashes, but few manufacturers used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto officials dispute that it is a matter of cost, saying
customers demand safer products.
</P>
<P>
   During a phase-in period between Sept. 1, 2003, and Aug. 31,
2006, vehicles will be required to meet requirements for reducing
air bag risks, either by automatically turning off the air bag in
the presence of young children or deploying the air bag in a manner
much less likely to cause serious or fatal injury, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During a second phase-in from Sept. 1, 2007, to Aug. 31, 2010,
the maximum test speed for belted average-size dummies will
increase from 30 mph to 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials say the rule could change after a
period of public comment and reaction to the slower-speed test.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 11; Nasdaq Up 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose in early trading today, as investors
shrugged off a stronger-than-expected employment report that gave
the Federal Reserve more reason to boost interest rates later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 11.17 at 10,423.66.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 3.29 at 1,412.67, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 21.51 at 3,741.75.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in the stock market came despite the release of a
surprisingly strong jobs data.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment
rate fell in April to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent, above the
4 percent level that analysts' had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, in
April rose 0.4 percent to $13.64, twice as fast as many analysts
were predicting.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger-than-expected number raised some fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
   But investors seem to brush off concerns about higher interest
rates, and continued to buy stocks. Analysts said Wall Street has
already started factoring in May's expected rate hike, so today's
news didn't have a stinging impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already seem a lot of damage in this market. We had a
vicious shakeout about a month ago,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Now, they can throw bad news at
us and we won't react as badly.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Wachtel added, that continued signs of robust economic
growth through May could start raising concerns of how the Fed will
act at their meeting in June. The question is whether they will
boost rates again and how aggressive their stance will be.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, as investors poured
money into the sector believing they might better handle a spate of
higher interest rates. Applied Materials gained 3 7/64 to 100 55/64
and JDS Uniphase rose 1} to 93\.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was the most active Nasdaq stock, rising 2 to 65
5/8 on news that the data networking provider had acquired
Arrowpoint Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric led the Dow higher, gaining 3 9/16 to 157 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 109.32 million
shares, down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.50 at 505.41.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for a national
holiday. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.07
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.46 percent, and France's
CAC-40 was down 0.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate resumes debate on budget bills  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Senate resumed passing bills
embodying the 2000-01 state budget this morning, with legislative
leaders expecting the process to be completed within a few hours.
It is the 35th day since the start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly completed passing the 13 bills constituting
the $77.5 billion spending plan at 2:10 a.m. this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate adjourned Thursday evening after passing six
budget measures and reconvened this morning to approve the
remaining bills.
</P>
<P>
   The state spending plan is for the fiscal year that began April
1, and though more than a month late, lawmakers were considering
the new budget as being almost on time. Last year, the budget
wasn't finished until Aug. 4, only hours before it would have
become the latest budget in state history.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 16th straight year New York's budget is late.
</P>
<P>
   Just before adjourning this morning, Assembly Speaker Sheldon
drew laughter when he told his chamber, ''I think we can begin the
wind-down of this legislative session so that many of you can see
the sunshine this summer, perhaps with your constituents rather
than with each other in this chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers were initially expected to pass 11 bills
pertaining to the budget, but the state Assembly added two
supplemental bills due to technicalities, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget total was closer to Gov. George Pataki and the
Republican-led Senate's spending plans. The governor had proposed a
budget of $76.8 billion and the Senate approved spending $500
million more. Democrats who dominate the Assembly had passed a
resolution for a $78.2 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the budget represents nearly a 5 percent increase in
general fund spending -- money supported by taxpayers -- and just
under 6 percent in all funds from last year's spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first measures approved by both houses was to place a
record $3.8 billion transportation bond act before voters this
November. The bill sailed through the Senate without debate but was
met with some dissenting comments before passing in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are enacting some kind of a smoke and mirrors
budget. We should come to our fiscal senses ... so that the
majority of these projects could be paid in cash,'' said
Assemblyman William Parment, a Chautauqua County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Republican Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno
and Silver enjoyed cones of ''Budget Nut Crunch'' ice cream -- made
up of vanilla, caramel swirl and crunchy peanut brittle -- in front
of photographers at the Capitol. The snack was symbolic of the
leaders' habit in earlier years of working out disputes at an ice
cream parlor near the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The last major hurdle for final passage of the budget appeared
to have been cleared Tuesday when the state leaders reached a deal
on a debt-reform plan that called for establishing a cap on new
debt and on debt service payments. Lawmakers agreed to statutorily
set the cap on new debt at 4 percent of personal income and the cap
on debt service at 5 percent of all state government funds, both
retroactive to April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced Thursday that the debt reform plan will also
reduce from 40 years to 30 years the maximum length of time the
state can borrow money for. In addition, the state would also
institute a ban on using debt as a ''fiscal gimmick'' -- like the
state's Cuomo-era move of ''selling'' Attica prison to itself so it
could borrow against the value of the prison -- and restrict the use
of debt for capital purposes only.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should save the taxpayers of this state tens of millions
of dollars,'' Bruno said before the debt reform package breezed
through his chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Another last-minute kink worked out Thursday involved the
withdrawal of a new interpretation of taxes on electricity by the
Pataki administration that big non-manufacturing users of power
like supermarkets complained could cost them $45 million this year.
The measure will save those companies $150 million a year when
fully implemented in four years, legislators said.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget would include $1.5 billion in tax-cut initiatives
over five years, with the pricetag for the first year at less than
$100 million. Under the deal, the state's gross receipts tax on
energy would be eliminated for large manufacturers and reduced for
small manufacturers and residential ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the budget would be a record $1.2 billion
increase in public school aid to an estimated $13.6 billion, the
highest level in state history. In higher education, $680 million
would be spent on an expanded Tuition Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state's prescription drug program for senior
citizens, ''EPIC,'' would be expanded from 115,000 to about 215,000
enrollees within three years. The starting date of the expansion
was set for Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with budget adoption would be the implementation of a
five-year $17.1 billion bridge- and road-building program and a
$17.1 billion New York City-area mass transit improvement program.
</P>
<P>
   Following budget adoption, lawmakers would resume receiving
their paychecks, which had been withheld since their first payday
in the new fiscal year on April 12.

<HEADLINE> Queen Latifah Wins Game Show Tourney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Singer Queen Latifah, musician Lance Bass and
actor Ray Romano were big winners on the final installment of ABC's
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' celebrity week but didn't pocket
a cent.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Latifah strolled away with $250,000, and Bass and Romano
each won $125,000. Latifah's winnings go to The Lancelot Owens
Scholarship Foundation, a charity promoting youth education that's
named after her brother. Bass of the pop group 'N Sync is giving
his winnings to Challenge for the Children, a children's charity,
and Romano's loot goes to the D.A.R.E. anti-drug and violence
program.
</P>
<P>
   ABC isn't complaining about handing over the $500,000. The
network is taking home perhaps the biggest prize of all --
record-breaking numbers of people watching during a sweeps period
to see how celebrities performed.
</P>
<P>
   The first celebrity edition of ''Millionaire'' on Monday drew
35.8 million viewers, the most ever to watch the game show. And
indications are that Tuesday's edition did even better. For the
first time, ''Millionaire'' had more viewers than all of the
competing shows on CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and the WB combined, said
Marc Berman, an analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
   The week's previous winners included Rosie O'Donnell and Drew
Carey, who each walked away with $500,000 for their favorite
charities.
</P>
<P>
   A second celebrity week is planned for November.

<HEADLINE> Top court ruling clears way for murder trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's highest court has upheld an
appeals court ruling in a decision that allows prosecutors to
proceed with the murder case against an alleged Rochester gang
leader accused of commanding a hit squad that mistakenly killed a
Syracuse woman.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision issued Thursday, the Court of Appeals unanimously
ruled the word ''command'' has a commonly accepted meaning that
survives constitutional review under the state's 1995 death penalty
law.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Onondaga County Judge Joseph Fahey had dismissed
a first-degree murder charge against John Lee Couser, ruling the
pertinent section of the death penalty law was unconstitutionally
vague for not properly defining what was meant by ''command.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state Supreme Court Appellate Division in
Rochester overturned Fahey's ruling and agreed with prosecutors
that the common meaning of the word ''command'' was legally
sufficient. The Court of Appeals also came down on the side of
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified Couser, 35, as the leader of a Rochester
street gang known as the G-Boyz. While in jail in Rochester in
February 1997, Couser allegedly commanded other gang members to
lead a hit squad to Syracuse to kill James Hackett to keep him from
testifying against Couser in a drug-related robbery and attempted
murder case in Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   When the hit squad could not find James Hackett, they instead
killed his 62-year-old grandmother, Virginia Hackett, and seriously
wounded her two teen-age grandsons. Both survived gun wounds to the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Couser was indicted in 1997 on charges of first-degree murder
under two sections of the capital punishment law: that he commanded
the death squad to come to Syracuse to kill James Hackett and that
he should be held responsible for murdering Virginia Hackett during
a burglary at her home.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Assistant District Attorney Stephen Dougherty said the
decision means Couser can stand trial ''at long last.'' Prosecutors
said they would seek life in prison without parole for Couser.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been on hold pending appeals. Those appeals also
have held up the sentences of the three men who admitted shooting
Hackett in plea deals with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin Mitchell, 30, was sentenced to 7{ to 15 years after
pleading guilty to first-degree burglary. James Stanback, 31, and
Quentin Jenkins, 32, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and
were sentenced to 25 years to life.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Senate completed legislative
adoption of a $77.5 billion budget this morning on the 35th day of
the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Senate spent about 40 minutes completing the last
of the 13 bills embodying the spending plan. The last measure was

   New E-Mail Virus Disguised as Joke
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fresh from fending off the insistent advances of
an e-mail virus disguised as a love letter, computer users were
facing new variations of the destructive bug, one concealed as a
joke, another as a confirmation notice for a Mother's Day gift
order. Computer systems around the world were infected yesterday as
the virus, proclaiming ''ILOVEYOU'' in the subject line of an
e-mail, overwhelmed networks and burrowed into computer hard
drives, destroying files containing precious photos and video.
Today's victims included the United Nations headquarters in New
York. At least five variations of the bug were spreading today,
according to computer security company F-Secure Corp. in San Jose,
Calif. One version comes with an attachment labeled ''Very Funny,
while another arrives as confirmation that the recipient's credit
card has been charged $326.92 for a Mother's Day ''diamond
special,'' urging the reader to click on an attachment to print the
invoice. Opening either attachment releases the bug.

   Jobless Rate Falls to 3.9 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surging economy pushed the nation's
unemployment rate down to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in
April as 340,000 workers found jobs. The jobless rates for blacks
and Hispanics plunged to record monthly lows. The
bigger-than-expected drop in the jobless rate followed a 4.1
percent rate in March, the Labor Department said today. Also,
average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, in
April rose 0.4 percent to $13.64, twice as fast as many analysts
were predicting. The stronger-than-expected number raised some
fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much

</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- American automakers trail their foreign
counterparts in the annual J.D. Power and Associates' survey of new
car and truck quality. Owners of Honda's Acura luxury brand
reported the fewest problems -- 0.95 for each vehicle, according to
an executive summary of the report obtained yesterday by The
Associated Press. Toyota's Lexus luxury brand was second, with 1.07
problems, followed by Nissan's Infiniti brand, BMW, Toyota, Porsche
and Honda. The highest ranking American brand was General Motors
Corp.'s Buick, with 1.35 problems per vehicle. At the bottom of the
list was Korean automaker Kia, with 2.56 problems per vehicle,
followed by Suzuki, Daewoo and Hyundai. J.D. Power surveyed 47,909
new car and truck buyers after three months of ownership.

   CARMEL, Ind. (AP) -- Conseco Inc. took steps to shore up its

   Europe Bank Chief Reassures on Euro
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- In an unusual statement directed to
''European citizens'' instead of financial markets, the head of the
European Central Bank said today that consumers shouldn't worry
about the euro's recent decline and promised the bank will
''continue to do all it can'' to control inflation. ''I understand
their concerns, since a persistently lower euro exchange rate might
ultimately lead to higher prices in the shops. It may also
undermine the perception of the euro as a stable currency,'' Wim
Duisenberg said. ''Therefore, we at the ECB monitor the euro
exchange rate very closely.''

Hong Kong Exchange, where the blue-chip Hang Seng Index slipped

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher today, as investors
shrugged off a stronger-than-expected employment report that gave
the Federal Reserve more reason to boost interest rates later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 136.82 at 10,549.31.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 21.50 at 1,430.88, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 81.31 at 3,801.55.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in the stock market came despite the release of a
surprisingly strong jobs data.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment
rate fell in April to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent, above the
4 percent level that analysts' had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, in
April rose 0.4 percent to $13.64, twice as fast as many analysts
were predicting.
</P>
<P>
   While the tight labor market is good news for workers, it puts
pressure on employers to boost wages as they scramble to build
their staffs. That in turn boosts costs, which then can spur
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stronger-than-expected report gave the Federal Reserve
more reason to raise interest rates by as much as a half percentage
point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, seemed to brush off concerns about higher
interest rates, and continued to buy stocks. Analysts said Wall
Street has already started factoring in May's expected rate hike,
so today's news didn't have a stinging impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already seem a lot of damage in this market. We had a
vicious shakeout about a month ago,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Now, they can throw bad news at
us and we won't react as badly.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Wachtel added, continued signs of robust economic growth
through May could increase concerns about how the Fed will act at
their meeting in June. The question is whether it will boost rates
again and how aggressive it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, as investors poured
money into the sector believing they might better handle a spate of
higher interest rates. Applied Materials gained 3 11/16 to 101 7/16
and JDS Uniphase rose 2 33/64 to 94 1/64.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was the most active Nasdaq stock, rising 3 9/16 to
67 3/16 on news that the computer networking provider had acquired
Arrowpoint Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric led the Dow higher, gaining 5{ to 159{. GE's
shares will split 3-for-1 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 273.92 million
shares, up from 282.85 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 7.80 at 509.71.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Fall on Wet Outlook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices spiraled lower today in
early dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade amid new forecasts for
rains in the bone-dry Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said parts of the Midwest would receive showers
late this weekend, with more anticipated over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That sent grains and soybeans about 1 percent lower in early
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans and corn saw the heaviest selling, with investors
nervous about whether a soggy few days could partially ease the
drought impact that has pushed prices higher in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat's decline was attributed in part to a correction after
Thursday's rally, as well as to pressure from corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery fell 2{ cents to $2.74 a bushel; July
corn fell 1} cent to $2.48{ a bushel; July oats fell 1\ cent to
$1.26 a bushel; July soybeans fell 4\ cents to $5.68 a bushel.

   Beef futures advanced while pork futures retreated in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

   June live cattle rose .02 cent to 69.07 cents a pound; August

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British Airways PLC has completed the sale of its
86 percent stake in the parent company of French regional airline
Air Liberte.
</P>
<P>
   BA said Friday it sold its stake in Participations Aeronautique,
a holding company that controls Air Liberte, to Taitbout Antibes, a
European financial institution, for $3.34 billion. Taitbout Antibes
is controlled by Groupe Alpha and Marine-Wendel SA.
</P>
<P>
   Air Liberte has annual revenues of $528 million and employs
2,500 people. Air France had also bid for the regional airline,
which would have expanded its services in France and to French
overseas territories.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said the sale will result in a one-time charge
of $90 million.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Offers Cutoff Rebates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner is offering rebates and premium
channels to the 3.5 million customers it cut off from ABC this week
during a contract dispute with ABC's parent, Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable of New York City will give its subscribers a
two-day rebate and a free month of a premium channel. Similar
benefits will be offered in all affected areas, including Houston,
Los Angeles, and in North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the offer will be on this month's bills.
</P>
<P>
   The company's New York division apologized to customers for
dropping ABC's signal. ''Although we can't erase the frustration
this week's events might have caused you, we wish to demonstrate
our appreciation and reiterate our commitment to you,'' a full-page
ad in The New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner dropped ABC's signal Monday in a battle over
compensation for Disney's cable networks. The signal was restored
the next day after the two companies reached a truce and set a July
15 deadline to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission accused the cable company
Wednesday of violating regulations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, ABC offered a $198 rebate to a limited number of
Time Warner cable customers in New York City, Houston and Los
Angeles who want to switch to satellite television.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Reaches Long Beach Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Boeing Co. and the union representing
5,300 factory workers who build C-17 and 717 jets have reached a
tentative labor agreement on a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   United Aerospace Workers Local 148, representing the Long Beach
workers, has scheduled a ratification vote for 1 p.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached an agreement which provides improvements in
wages, pensions, health care, health and safety, and other
important areas,'' UAW vice president Ron Gettelfinger, director of
the UAW aerospace department, said Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed contract would be retroactive to May 1, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach workers assemble both the C-17, a military
transport jet, and the 717-200, a 106-seat passenger jet.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the company declined further comment Thursday,
prompting complaints from plant workers who said they wanted more
details of the proposed agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody except the bargaining committee has seen anything,''
said Howard Debord of Anaheim, an electronics technician on the
C-17. ''They are asking us to buy something that you can't see --
it's a pig in a poke.''
</P>
<P>
   Some complained that the union statement made no mention of job
security language in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, if there isn't any job security
language, it's an automatic no vote,'' said Pat Bower, another
worker on the C-17 program. ''What is the money if you don't have a
job?''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, workers in Long Beach did not want a seniority
split between the C-17, military and 717 commercial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs have hit the union hard over the past nine months. On
Monday, another 69 UAW employees received 60-day layoff notices.
Nearly 3,000 jobs have been cut since the last contract negotiation
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers lost their jobs because Boeing has discontinued the
MD-80, MD-90 and MD-11 passenger jet programs, and others have been
replaced as Boeing moved more work to subcontractors and other
plants.

<HEADLINE> BMW: Phoenix Rover Offer Not Solid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- A British consortium seeking to take over
BMW's struggling Rover car business has yet to provide assurances
that it can provide sufficient financial backing, BMW said Friday.
Talks are continuing, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't yet been able to provide a letter of comfort,''
BMW spokesman Juerg Dinner said.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Phoenix, a consortium led by Rover's former chief
executive John Towers, and BMW have reached a critical point and
are continuing, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
   Towers met Friday with British Trade Secretary Stephen Byers in
London. However, he did not make a formal request for government
funds, a spokesman for the British Department of Trade and Industry
said.
</P>
<P>
   BMW is struggling to unload its unprofitable Rover unit after a
previous agreement to turn over the troubled subsidiary to a
venture capital firm collapsed late last month. The German
automaker warned last week that it would shut down Rover's car
operations if it doesn't find a suitable candidate by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   As discussions about its future unfolded, Rover reported
unexpectedly strong sales of its cars in Britain last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rover sales more than doubled in April to take 13.5 percent
share of the British new car market, up from 5.7 percent a year
ago. The Rover 25 model was Britain's best-selling car in April --
the first time in more than five years that Rover has enjoyed that
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Rover attributed the improvement to its introduction last month
of strong sales incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could not have come at a better time for Rover,'' said
Sir Ken Jackson, head of Britain's Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union. ''It shows there is still a future for the
company.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets New Japanese Leader  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton greeted new Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori today with praise for Japan's rebounding
economy and an overture to the people of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Mori, who became prime minister a month ago after
Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke, strolled across the White House
Rose Garden to the Oval Office for their first official meeting.
Mori smiled but did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders met for an hour and 15 minutes, discussing
Japan's economy, Mori's recent meeting with Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Clinton's effort to secure normal trade
relations with China, according to a White House official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Mori brought with him a baseball that Clinton
signed and sent to him in 1993, when Mori was trade minister.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed hope that Japan would continue to rebuild
rapidly, relying on the ''inherent strengths'' of a highly skilled,
educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's getting better,'' Clinton said. ''I believe that
they will return to big growth, I hope sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Mori also discussed the Group of Eight economic
summit, scheduled for July in the town of Nago on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will attend the summit, becoming the first U.S.
president to visit Okinawa since America relinquished the island's
postwar administration to Japan in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military bases on Okinawa are a source of friction for
residents, who have been angry at the American presence there since
two Marines and a sailor raped a local schoolgirl in 1995. A small
island about 1,000 miles from Tokyo, Okinawa houses about
two-thirds of the more than 50,000 U.S. military personnel
stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would consult with Mori today on the best way to
reach out to the people of Okinawa when he visits this summer.

<HEADLINE> It's a dumbbell, it's a dog bone, it's an asteroid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Astronomers say they have found one of the
most uniquely shaped objects in outer space -- an asteroid in the
shape of a dog bone.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid, named 216 Kleopatra, measures 135 miles long and
about 58 miles wide -- roughly the size of the state of New Jersey --
and is located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
Although Kleopatra was first discovered in 1880, its shape had been
unknown until now.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists used Cornell University's massive Arecibo Observatory
telescope in Puerto Rico, which is the world's most powerful radar
system. It obtained radar images that show the oblong asteroid with
two large bulges at either end of a narrow arm. They form a shape
that looks like a dog bone or distorted dumbbell.
</P>
<P>
   ''With its dog bone shape, Kleopatra has the most unusual shape
we've seen in the solar system,'' said Steven Ostro of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ''The object's existence is a perplexing
mystery that tells us how far we have to go to understand more
about asteroid shapes and collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers speculate that the asteroid's striking shape is the
result of a violent cosmic collision. Their findings appeared in
Friday's issue of the journal, ''Science.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The shape may have been produced by the collision of two
objects that had previously been thoroughly fractured and ground
into piles of loosely consolidated rubble,'' said R. Scott Hudson
of Washington State University, one of Ostro's team of astronomers
who observed the asteroid. ''Or, Kleopatra may once have been two
separate lobes in orbit around each other with empty space between
them, with subsequent impacts filling in the area between the lobes
with debris.''
</P>
<P>
   Its strong reflection of radar signals and its coloring indicate
Kleopatra is mostly metal, possibly nickel-iron alloy, said Donald
Campbell, associate director at Arecibo.
</P>
<P>
   The images were obtained when Kleopatra was about 106 million
miles from Earth and are the first radar images of a main belt
asteroid. Astronomers used the 1,000-foot telescope to bounce radar
signals off the asteroid. With sophisticated computer analysis
equipment, they decoded the echoes, transformed them into images
and assembled a computer model of the asteroid's shape.

<HEADLINE> Feds Missing Another Laptop Computer  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department has discovered another
laptop computer is missing. This one was signed out to a senior
official, Morton H. Halperin, the assistant secretary of state for
policy planning.
</P>
<P>
   A department official said the computer was found to be missing
during an inventory ordered after the unexplained disappearance in
February of a laptop computer containing highly classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   The second missing portable computer was not used for classified
information, a department official told The Associated Press today.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Permanent Committee on Intelligence
told The Associated Press, meanwhile, that ''there is not
sufficient awareness, or sufficient attention, to security'' at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an arrogance -- we know better, we don't have to do
anything about it,'' said Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright testified at a closed
committee hearing Thursday. Goss said he did not include her in his
description.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, ''it is far to characterize the secretary of
state as being in complete agreement'' that insufficient attention
was paid to classified material.
</P>
<P>
   Goss did not provide details of her testimony; rules of the
committee prohibit that. He said, though, that ''she used the word
'appalled.' The fact that she was willing to fix things and go
forward is very good news.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Albright, furious about recent security lapses,
delivered a strong plea to department employees for greater
vigilance to protect secret material.
</P>
<P>
   New security measures are likely to be adopted, including
tightened restrictions on where visitors with building passes may
go.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has told principal supervisory personnel to stress the
importance of security to their staffs. In addition, annual
refresher security briefings will be intensified, with mandatory
attendance for all appropriate department employees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the first missing laptop contained large
quantities of documents about arms proliferation issues and highly
sensitive information about sources and methods of U.S.
intelligence collection.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a bugging device was found in a conference room.

<HEADLINE> Thais Backs Asia Monetary Fund  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK McDOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand is trying to build support
among Asian countries for a regional monetary fund that would work
alongside global institutions like the IMF to head off future
financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for an Asian monetary fund, which ran into U.S.
opposition during the regional economic crisis in 1997, has been
revived for the three-day annual meeting of the Asian Development
Bank opening Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, the first domino to fall in the crisis, has been
sending signals that it would like the Manila-based bank to expand
its mission of reducing poverty to become lender of last resort
during financial upheavals.
</P>
<P>
   The change could reduce the power of the Washington-based
International Monetary Fund and the influence many smaller nations
believe the U.S. government holds over it.
</P>
<P>
   Supachai Panitchpakdi, the deputy prime minister who takes over
the helm of the World Trade Organization in 2002, said at a
pre-meeting seminar Friday that he personally thought a bigger role
for regional institutions like the ADB was ''inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned against any arrangement that would preclude
''the real solution to the crisis, which is the reform of our
financial and real sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Supachai declined to confirm expectations that the 10-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations would propose that China,
Japan and South Korea join a currency swap program, a move that is
widely seen as the first step toward a monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN's economic ministers in March agreed to get such a plan
off the ground. ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The swap plan would enable central banks to draw on each others'
foreign exchange reserves to repel speculative currency attacks,
one of the triggers Thailand believes pushed its overheated economy
into collapse in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine National Treasurer Leonor Briones has said she
personally supports such a facility.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries have been critical of the delays and misdirected
programs imposed by the IMF in grappling with the Asian crisis. The
IMF itself has admitted many mistakes were made.
</P>
<P>
   Supachai and Pisit Leeahtam, Thailand's deputy finance minister,
stressed that any regional arrangement should complement the IMF
and other multilateral institutions, not replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Pisit told reporters such a fund would attract backers from
richer countries in the region if it had the clear backing of
Japan, the dominant force in the Asian Development Bank and biggest
investor in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Japan really wants to be big brother, I think the others
would like to follow as well,'' Pisit said.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN has been bringing the Northeast Asian powers -- Japan,
China and South Korea -- into its forums to make Asia a stronger
bloc on the world stage against the North American Free Trade Area
and European Union.
</P>
<P>
   While Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has reportedly
said the multilateral-swap system could be a major defense against
currency attacks, there is no certainty he will propose it during
his visit here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Tokyo monetary official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that while Japan would be willing to consider
ASEAN's proposal for a currency pact, Tokyo has nothing concrete in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement would be highly complex to set up and
require a web of bilateral currency agreements, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Telefonica Calls Off KPN Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain's Telefonica has called off merger
talks with Dutch telecom company KPN that would have created
Europe's third largest wireless company and a major provider of
Internet access to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Telefonica and KPN have reached a joint agreement to end their
merger talks because circumstances aren't ideal for a successful
operation,'' Telefonica said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   News reports had indicated that the two companies were not
willing to proceed with the talks if the discussions weren't
supported unanimously by the boards of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica's two biggest shareholders, Banco Bilboa Vizcaya
Argentaria SA and La Caixa, reportedly were concerned at the size
of the Dutch government's 44 percent stake in KPN. Both are on
Telefonica's board.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Spanish Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato said he
considered the Dutch government's 44 percent stake in KPN to be
''excessive.'' He also asked the Dutch government to ''abandon its
position as the company's main shareholder irrevocably and
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica and KPN, one of Europe's principal data and wireless
services, were studying a joint holding company with 60 percent
going to Telefonica shareholders and the rest to KPN shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica, the largest telecommunications presence in Spain and
Latin America, was privatized in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 134; Nasdaq Up 75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues led the stock market higher
today despite an employment report that raised expectations of a
big increase in interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 134.65 at 10,547.14.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 20.23 at 1,429.61, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 75.48 at 3,795.72.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in the stock market came despite the release of a
surprisingly strong jobs report.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate fell in
April to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent. Most analysts had
expected a 4.0 reading.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, in
April rose 0.4 percent to $13.64, twice as fast as many analysts
were predicting.
</P>
<P>
   While the tight labor market is good news for workers, it puts
pressure on employers to boost wages. That in turn raises costs,
which then can spur inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stronger-than-expected report gave the Federal Reserve
more reason to raise interest rates by as much as a half percentage
point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, seemed to brush off concerns about higher
interest rates, and continued to buy stocks. Analysts said Wall
Street has already started factoring in May's expected rate hike,
so today's news didn't have a stinging impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already seen a lot of damage in this market. We had a
vicious shakeout about a month ago,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Now, they can throw bad news at
us and we won't react as badly.''
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts said, continued signs of robust economic growth
through May could increase concerns about how the Fed will act at
their meeting in June. The question is whether it will boost rates
again and how aggressive it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some consensus in the stock market that the Fed will
raise interest rates a half-point in May and the market is prepared
for that,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. ''After that, we will have to work our way through the
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, as investors poured
money into the sector believing they might better handle a spate of
higher interest rates. Applied Materials gained 3 1/4 to 101 and
JDS Uniphase rose 2 1/2 to 94.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was the most active Nasdaq stock, rising 3 7/8 to
67 1/2 on news that the computer networking provider had acquired
Arrowpoint Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the strongest Dow component, rising 5 5/16
to 137 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 4 to 158 in advance of a 3-for-1 stock
split due to take effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 551.53 million
shares, down from 588.52 million shares on Thursday. Volume has
been low all week, with some traders opting to head to the
sidelines while the market digested the latest slate of economic
news.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 7.23 at 509.14.

<HEADLINE> Burglar gets 50 years in slaying of woman whose 3-year-old watched  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGETON, N.J. (AP) -- A burglar was sentenced to 50 years in
prison Friday for killing a pregnant woman as her 3-year-old
daughter watched.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler, who was unhurt in the attack, stayed with her
mother's body for 17 hours afterward.
</P>
<P>
   David Mosley, 25, will have to serve at least 42{ years for the
May 31, 1999, death of Laquanda Fedd.
</P>
<P>
   Fedd, 22, a single mother who was four months pregnant, was
pushed down a flight of stairs and then stabbed when she surprised
Mosley during a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Braizonna Williams, tried to fight off Mosley and
witnessed the killing, police said. She stayed in the house with
the body -- in bed, holding bedsheets over her head -- until the next
day, when Fedd's mother came looking for Fedd.
</P>
<P>
   ''She stayed in that house with her mother for 17 hours,
crossing over her mother's body to go the bathroom and crossing
back over it to go back to bed,'' said Fedd's aunt, Kathy
Williamson, 44.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was not present in court for Mosley's sentencing.
Fedd's relatives wept quietly as they sat in the gallery, clutching
photographs of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Lillie Baker, 42, the victim's mother, clutched a sonogram image
of Fedd's unborn baby as she addressed Mosley, barking at him
''Look at me!'' when he hung his head.
</P>
<P>
   Braizonna remains scarred by what she saw -- afraid to go to the
bathroom by herself and frequently warning Baker to lock the
windows and doors, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All she can talk about is the 'bad man,' '' Baker said. ''Why
did the bad man hurt my mommy?' She says, 'My mommy's an angel now.
The bad man can't hurt her now,''' said Baker, who has custody of
the child.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson said her niece tells people: ''When you're laying on
your back, you're dead. When you're laying on your side, you're
sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who has more than 20 arrests for burglary, drug offenses
and disorderly persons charges, said he was looking for drugs and
money belonging to Fedd's boyfriend, Basil Williams, when he broke
into her neatly kept three-story home on Giles Street.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknown to him, Fedd had split up with Williams, the girl's
father; he was in jail the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking no one was home, Mosley entered the house carrying no
weapon but was surprised to find Fedd. She told him he would go to
jail for the break-in, he said when he entered his plea in March.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said he was afraid Williams would kill him if he found
out about the break-in. During a struggle, she fell down stairs,
and he then grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed her, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a particularly grisly, violent act,'' said Superior
Court Judge G. Thomas Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   Baker found the body the next day after being called by Fedd's
employer, who said she had not reported for work. Mosley wasn't
charged in the death of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry for what happened to your loved one,'' he said,
turning to face Baker in court Friday. ''If I could take it back, I
would. I know it's a horrible thing I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker didn't want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go away! Turn around!'' she said, interrupting him.

laptop computer to be missing. One was signed out to a senior

<HEADLINE> China Defends Falun Gong Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- China defended its rights record Friday, telling a
U.N. human rights panel it banned the Falun Gong spiritual movement
''according to law'' and rejecting allegations that Chinese
prisoners are tortured.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions from the U.N. Committee Against Torture,
Chinese officials also defended ''re-education through labor,''
saying the practice ''has redeemed many people and prevented them
from sliding further down the road to crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. panel is reviewing China's periodic report on its
compliance with a 1984 convention against torture. The panel is to
issue its conclusions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups in China have said beatings, forced labor,
bad food and poor medical care are common in Chinese prisons. While
top Chinese officials have expressed opposition to the use of
torture, such policies are often not enforced at the local level,
the groups say.
</P>
<P>
   The government has allowed the media to report some torture
cases, though officials withhold information about cases involving
political prisoners and people linked to the Falun Gong movement.
</P>
<P>
   China banned Falun Gong last July, rounding up its leaders and
warning adherents to renounce the movement or risk punishment. It
says the group is politically motivated and caused the deaths of
hundreds of people who avoided medical care due to their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a responsible government, the Chinese government cannot and
should not sit idly and tolerate the cult Falun Gong endangering
society and bringing harm to our people,'' Chinese Ambassador Qiao
Zonghuai said.
</P>
<P>
   China ''banned it according to law,'' Qiao said. ''As for the
handful of Falun Gong plotters, organizers and core members who
engaged in illegal activities ... the judicial organs in China have
cracked down on them according to law.''
</P>
<P>
   He also denied that prisoners were tortured in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese delegation insisted all prisoners in China enjoy
equal treatment, adding ''the allegation that the Chinese
government applies torture in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities
is scandalous.''

<HEADLINE> New Turkey President Is Pro-Reform  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's next president is a top judge who
believes in the rigid enforcement of rules and laws, a point he
dramatized last year when he walked out of a banquet for President
Clinton after being bumped down on the protocol list.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Necdet Sezer, 58, has boycotted state dinners since the
October incident but will be expected to sit at the head of the
table when he succeeds President Suleyman Demirel on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a personality that isn't shy of making a point in line
with his principles,'' wrote Sedat Ergin, a columnist for Hurriyet
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer, chief justice of Turkey's highest court, was elected
Friday to an office that, although largely ceremonial, he says is
too powerful and infringes on democratic rights. Sezer particularly
objects to the president's right to veto legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In his only public appearance since being nominated two weeks
ago, Sezer said that ''the powers given to the president exceed the
boundaries of parliamentary democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The tall, slightly balding Sezer made headlines last year for
speeches in which he called for a revision of Turkey's
constitution, drawn up under the scrutiny of the generals during
the 1980-1983 military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer says the constitution restricts basic rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Such views have made him a hope for reforms in Turkey, which
would help Turkey's bid for European Union membership. The EU
insists that Turkey carry out sweeping reforms before it can be
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's visit, Sezer was angered when he was pushed
down on the protocol list at the banquet table in favor of Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had
requested to sit next to Cem.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer is the first judge to be elected president in Turkey,
where six out of the nine previous heads of state have been
generals.
</P>
<P>
   Born September 13, 1941, in the central city of Afyon, Sezer was
the son of a school teacher and went to the same high school as his
predecessor, Demirel. His hard work earned him a place at the
country's top law school, Ankara University Law Faculty, where he
graduated in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as judge in several provinces, he became an
appeals court judge in 1983 and five years later was picked by
President Kenan Evren, the leader of the 1980 military coup, to be
a judge in the Constitutional Court. He has headed the court since
1998.
</P>
<P>
   His schoolteacher wife, Semra, retired early to help nurse Sezer
back to health after heart surgery earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've led a modest life,'' Semra Sezer told Sabah newspaper
after his nomination. ''I would like it to carry on that way.''
</P>
<P>
   They have three children.

   New E-Mail Virus Disguised as Joke
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At least five variations of the ''ILOVEYOU''
e-mail computer virus that caused havoc around the world yesterday
were reported circulating today. Computer security company F-Secure
Corp. in San Jose, Calif. said one version comes with an attachment
labeled ''Very Funny, while another arrives as confirmation that
the recipient's credit card has been charged $326.92 for a Mother's
Day ''diamond special,'' urging the reader to click on an
attachment to print the invoice. Opening either attachment releases
the bug. The original virus overwhelmed networks and burrowed into
computer hard drives, destroying files containing precious photos
and video. It seemed to be diminishing today, but added the United
Nations headquarters in New York to its victims. Authorities in the
Philippines were investigating leads on the source of the virus
attacks based on information from an Internet service provider
there.

   Jobless Rate Falls to 3.9 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surging economy pushed the nation's
unemployment rate down to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in
April, and workers' average hourly earnings, a key guage of
inflation pressures, rose 0.4 percent. The stronger than expected
showing announced by the Labor Department led some to expectations
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by as much as a
half-point later this month to curb inflation. The jobless report
also showed Hispanic and Black unemployment at record monthly lows.

Aviation Administration recorded 322 incidents in 1999, just three
fewer than the year before. With 10 incidents, called incursions,
Los Angeles International had the highest total. But it ranked 21st
in the country in incidents per 100,000 operations, with a rate of
1.285. An operation is either a takeoff or landing. An incursion is
an incident involving a collision hazard at an airport, but not

financial crises. The campaign for an Asian monetary fund, which
ran into U.S. opposition during the regional economic crisis in
1997, has been revived for the three-day annual meeting of the
Asian Development Bank this weekend. Thailand has been indicating
that it would like the Manila-based bank to become lender of last
resort during financial upheavals. The change could reduce the
power of the Washington-based International Monetary Fund and the
influence many smaller nations believe the U.S. government holds
over it.

<HEADLINE> Better if Stroke Victims Go Home  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Stroke victims appear to make a faster recovery if
they are sent home earlier from the hospital, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke patients undergoing at-home therapy mastered simple tasks
such as walking up stairs, doing housework or working in the garden
more quickly than those who had longer hospital stays, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about being at home and being reintegrated back into
society, which we've shown actually improves the physical
well-being of these survivors,'' said Nancy E. Mayo, an
epidemiologist at McGill University in Montreal who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were published in the latest issue of Stroke, a
journal of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo and her team followed 58 patients who were chosen at random
to go home early and 56 others, then tested both groups three
months later to see how their rehabilitation was going.
</P>
<P>
   The average hospital stay for the patients who were discharged
early was 10 days -- six days shorter than the patients who
underwent conventional rehabilitation in the hospital or at an
outpatient clinic.
</P>
<P>
   At the three-month mark, the stroke patients who went home early
were already back to doing chores around the house and even walking
several blocks for therapy. They also did better at resuming their
roles as a parent or spouse and kept in closer touch with friends
and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The patients who underwent therapy at home all had a caregiver
in the house and were visited by physical therapists and other
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who received the traditional post-stroke care at
hospitals or outpatient clinics were about five points behind the
home-rehabilitation group when ranked on a physical well-being
scale of one to 50.
</P>
<P>
   The findings support other research that seem to point toward
early hospital discharge once the patient is medically stable as
the best way to get people back to a normal life, Mayo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rehabilitation should get people back to playing golf, back to
work and driving the car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The study clearly points the way toward changing post-stroke
care toward more home rehabilitation, said University of Kansas
Medical Center epidemiologist Pamela Duncan, director of research
at the hospital's center on aging.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just means that if you can get the support at home, it
really improves the quality of life for these patients,'' Duncan
said.

<HEADLINE> London Has a New Mayor  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- London has a new mayor, and Prime Minister Tony
Blair has some problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Livingstone, who was kicked out of Blair's Labor Party but
gained public sympathy from the prime minister's active hostility,
easily won the first citywide mayoral race when votes were tallied
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His victory marked one of a string of defeats for Labor in local
government around England and Wales, demonstrating that Blair's
honeymoon with the voters is over. In elections for more than 3,300
seats on 152 local councils -- polls seen as a referendum on Blair's
3-year-old government -- the Conservatives gained 593 seats, while
Labor lost 568.
</P>
<P>
   Blair argued that voters had not yet seen the fruits of
''long-term changes that have to be made'' in areas such as
fighting crime and improving medical care. ''I'm the very first to
admit, although we have achieved a lot there is still a lot to
do,'' he told reporters in Hillsborough, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Midterm is often a testing time for government, and British
voters have developed a habit of punishing the party in power. They
did it repeatedly to the Conservatives during their long run in
government from 1979 to 1997, and this week's reverses hardly
spelled doom for Blair. He remains the favorite to win the next
election, though not on the massive scale of Labor's 1997 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Livingstone solidly defeated Conservative Steve
Norris. Labor nominee Frank Dobson, who won the party's nomination
in a process Livingstone claimed was rigged against him, finished
third, a point ahead of the Liberal Democrats' Susan Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years
ago,'' Livingstone quipped, referring to the 1986 abolition of the
previous London-wide government, which he headed.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone, 54, said the elections were ''a real wake-up call''
for the Labor Party, which he hopes to rejoin. He was thrown out of
Labor after he entered the race as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no good giving promises of what might come in a few
years -- people want to see it happen before they go to the polls
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's post -- a job created as part of Blair's program of
building up regional government -- will oversee a $5.3 billion
budget and assume responsibility for the police, transportation,
fire and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Livingstone said they hope to cooperate, but they will
likely battle over the pressing issue of funding reconstruction of
the London Underground subway system. Blair favors a mix of public
and private investment, while Livingstone opposes any
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe that a government that has suffered this
drubbing at the polls will want a fight with millions of Londoners
who do not want their tube broken up,'' Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   The subways were a battleground in the 1980s, when ''Red Ken''
Livingstone headed the Greater London Council. Margaret Thatcher's
government opposed Livingstone's program of slashing fares because
that required government subsidies. Thatcher won the argument
decisively: She abolished the council.
</P>
<P>
   In the London balloting, voters mark a first and second choice
on their ballots, and if no candidate wins a majority of the
first-choice votes, the second-choice ballots are counted.
Livingstone won 38 percent of the first preference votes to 26.5
percent for Norris. A count of the second-preference ballots
confirmed his victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the new London Assembly, Labor and Conservative candidates
each won nine seats, along with four Liberal Democrats and three
Greens.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Israel-Syria Fight End  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
urged Israel and Syria to act to stop the fighting across Israel's
border with Lebanon. The State Department spokesman said the
conflict could undermine U.S. peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Albright conferred with Israeli Ambassador David Ivri at a
dinner of the American Jewish Committee on Thursday and telephoned
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas based in Lebanon shelled northern Israel a
second day Friday. Israeli warplanes blasted power installations in
Beirut and northern Lebanon in response.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher read a statement to
reporters Friday that said ''we deplore the attacks on both sides
involving civilians and civilian facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not blame one side or the other for the
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is to get restraint to try to stop the
escalation of violence because that can disrupt the ongoing peace
effort,'' Boucher said in response to a question.
</P>
<P>
   American mediators Dennis Ross and Aaron Miller are
participating in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians,
which are due to resume on Sunday after a break.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides put a variety of issues on the table and they had
serious exchanges on those ideas,'' Boucher said of the talks in
Eilat, an Israeli resort city on the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   He made no claim of progress toward a settlement that President
Clinton has called for by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has vowed to withdraw Israeli
troops from the security zone they control in southern Lebanon.
Syria, which plays a dominant role in Lebanon, is believed to help
get weapons to the Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher declined to say whether the State Department had
determined whether or not the guerrillas acted on their own in
shelling northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Albright telephoned the Syrian foreign minister,
however, suggested she believes Syria has influence over the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is reluctant to see Israel pull out without turning over
the Golan Heights to Syria as part of an overall Middle East
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has sent message to all the parties, Boucher said,
while Ross and U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk met with Barak in Tel
Aviv on Thursday. In Lebanon, U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield met
with Prime Minister Salim Hoss. She spoke to al-Sharaa on the
telephone and to Ivri at the dinner, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a situation that does concern us, and we really do
regret the loss of life on both sides and urge every one to
exercise maximum restraint,'' the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Troops Try Jaffna Defense  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Thousands of Sri Lankan troops
regrouped today to protect their hold on the former rebel capital,
a day after the government imposed censorship on foreign media and
gave the military wide powers to help fight Tamil Tiger insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Information Department said the military
successfully repulsed several rebel attempts to breach the defense
line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Troops supported by artillery and mortar fire effectively
repulsed all terrorist attempts compelling them to withdraw
southwards,'' Ariya Rubasinghe, director of information, said in a
statement. Rubasinghe is also the government's chief censor.
</P>
<P>
   Rubasinghe said two soldiers were killed and one wounded in the
latest fighting. He listed rebel deaths at 458 killed since the
rebel offensive to take the Elephant Pass causeway began on April
27.
</P>
<P>
   ''Troops at present are in a stronger position consequent to the
pullout from Elephant Pass and are poised to launch attacks on the
temporary defenses occupied by the terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been fighting for 17
years for an independent homeland for the country's 3.2 million
minority Tamils. They accuse the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs, a charge the government
denies. The government labels the Tamil rebels as terrorists,
accusing them of attempts to divide the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels did not post any new information on the group's
Internet site today, but the Voice of Tiger radio, monitored in
Vavuniya, said the battle continued. It did not give details.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a senior military official said the morale of the
military, seriously undermined after recent rebel successes, has
improved since the government's stand against the rebels' advance
toward their former capital, Jaffna. The official spoke on
condition that he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   The military official said the string of setbacks, in which the
Sri Lankan troops lost several key bases, had come to a stop.
Soldiers' morale was also boosted by the government's statement
that it is satisfied with the response it has gotten from requests
for help from friendly countries, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not released any details of its requests. But
on Thursday, Sri Lanka renewed diplomatic ties with Israel after a
30-year lapse. Tel Aviv welcomed the resumption of diplomatic ties
with Colombo and said a delegation of Sri Lankan officials would
travel to Israel to discuss renewed relations.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka is hoping to get weapons from Israel to replenish
armaments lost in the recent battles with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian delegation has arrived in Sri Lanka, state-run radio
said today. The report did not give a reason for the Russian
presence, but Sri Lanka has in the past bought arms and aircraft
from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka was put under war status on Thursday, when the
government invoked the Public Security Act. The law gives sweeping
powers to the military, police and administration to deal with the
Tamil rebels' threat to divide the country.
</P>
<P>
   The government can now seize aircraft, ships and any property
without giving a reason, ban publication of newspapers and leaflets
and prohibit demonstrations and strikes that may harm the country's
war effort.
</P>
<P>
   The international journalists' group Reporters Sans Frontiers
has criticized the government for censoring foreign media coverage
of military operations. The Paris-based group said it sent a letter
asking the government to lift the censorship and ensure the safety
of Sri Lankan and foreign reporters working in the country.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 147; Nasdaq Up 76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues led the stock market higher
today despite an employment report that raised expectations of a
big increase in interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 147.06 at 10,559.55.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 21.39 at 1,430.77, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 76.47 at 3,796.71.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in the stock market came despite the release of a
surprisingly strong jobs report.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate fell in
April to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent. Most analysts had
expected a 4.0 reading.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, in
April rose 0.4 percent to $13.64, twice as fast as many analysts
were predicting.
</P>
<P>
   While the tight labor market is good news for workers, it puts
pressure on employers to boost wages. That in turn raises costs,
which then can spur inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stronger-than-expected report gave the Federal Reserve
more reason to raise interest rates by as much as a half percentage
point at its May 16 meeting as it works to keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, seemed to brush off concerns about higher
interest rates, and continued to buy stocks. Analysts said Wall
Street has already started factoring in May's expected rate hike,
so today's news didn't have a stinging impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already seen a lot of damage in this market. We had a
vicious shakeout about a month ago,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Now, they can throw bad news at
us and we won't react as badly.''
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts said, continued signs of robust economic growth
through May could increase concerns about how the Fed will act at
their meeting in June. The question is whether it will boost rates
again and how aggressive it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some consensus in the stock market that the Fed will
raise interest rates a half-point in May and the market is prepared
for that,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. ''After that, we will have to work our way through the
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, as investors poured
money into the sector, believing that rapid growth will equip those
companies to best handle a spate of interest rate increases.
Applied Materials gained 3 7/16 to 101 3/16 and JDS Uniphase rose 2
1/4 to 93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was the most active Nasdaq stock, rising 3 9/64 to
66 49/64 on news that the computer networking provider had acquired
Arrowpoint Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the strongest Dow component, rising 6 7/16
to 138 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 4 1/16 to 158 1/16 in advance of a 3-for-1
stock plit due to take effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet retailers rose after Lehman Brothers initiated
coverage of the sector. Amazon.com rose 2 15/16 to 58.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 645.23 million
shares, down from 704.32 million shares on Thursday. Volume has
been low all week, with some traders opting to head to the
sidelines while the market digested the latest slate of economic
news.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, four stocks rose for every three that fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 7.92 at 509.83.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Scholar Protests US Treatment  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A prominent Jordanian Muslim scholar said
Friday he was denied entry to the United States this week and was
interrogated by U.S. immigration authorities who wanted to know if
he had links with terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I faced in New York was simply piracy,'' Ishaq Farhan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's incident has prompted Prime Minister Abdur-Ra'uf S.
Rawabdeh to demand clarification from Washington, a senior
government official said on condition of anonymity. He declined to
provide other details.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Farhan's visa had been revoked and that the U.S. Embassy in Amman
was remiss in not informing him.
</P>
<P>
   William Burns, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, has apologized to
Farhan for the oversight, Boucher said. He was unable to say why
the visa was revoked, adding that the decision is being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Farhan, a former minister of education, is the director of
Jordan's Zarqa University. He also heads the 120-member
Consultative Council of the Islamic Action Front. The Front is the
political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement, Jordan's main
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Farhan, an education graduate from the United States, is a
moderate who backs dialogue among religions and moderation in
Islamic doctrine. He has often sided with the state against
hard-line members of his own group who favor strict Islamic laws,
such as veiling women and segregating the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Farhan, who carries a diplomatic passport, said he was going to
the United States to attend an Islamic academic conference in New
York and then visit his two daughters in Columbus, Ohio. U.S.
immigration officials at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport took
his passport and told him there were instructions from the State
Department to question him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They asked me 30 silly questions like 'Are you affiliated with
terrorist organizations?' and 'Do you advocate terrorism?''' he
said. ''I answered, 'Neither I nor our religion believes in
terrorism because we are people who believe in peace.'''
</P>
<P>
   Farhan said he was banned from making calls. He said officials
of the Jordanian airline he traveled on informed Jordanian
diplomats in the United States of the interrogation. Subsequently,
he said, calls started to arrive at the airport's immigration
office, ultimately leading to his release.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the INS canceled his five-year, multiple-entry visa
and put him on the first flight back to Amman.
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, he said, the Jordanian foreign minister told him at a
meeting on Thursday that he has asked the U.S. ambassador to
Jordan, William Burns, and the Jordanian ambassador to the United
States, Marwan Mouasher, to explain the U.S. action.
</P>
<P>
   Farhan declined to say what action he will take. ''Serious moral
damage was inflicted upon me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farhan's party and other Jordanian political groups have urged
the government to condemn the INS action.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani, Clinton Buy New Ads  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani launched a new TV
commercial Friday, squelching speculation for the time being that
he has decided to give up his Senate campaign against Hillary
Rodham Clinton because of his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign aides said the ad will air statewide for about
two weeks at a cost that could top $1 million. He has had campaign
ads running off and on for months.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady launched her first statewide TV ad this week,
also for a two-week run. It is expected to cost about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the new ads directly attacks the other candidate,
though Giuliani's has thinly veiled barbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be a senator because I was born in this state,'' the
mayor says in the ad from a recent campaign stop in Saratoga
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The moment serves two purposes -- to reinforce Clinton's
''carpetbagger'' image and to demonstrate that Giuliani does make
campaign stops in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republican leaders have been grumbling that Giuliani
hasn't been spending enough time in the traditionally more
conservative region of the state that accounts for 45 percent of
the vote in statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been crisscrossing the region. On Thursday, she
visited Clinton County in far northern New York to complete a tour
of all 62 New York counties in the 10 months since she began
actively campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   A Giuliani campaign announcement Thursday that his latest ad was
being postponed in deference to Cardinal John O'Connor's death had
touched off new speculation that the mayor had decided to drop out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, denied that. The
campaign later said the ad would begin airing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has said he will decide before the end of May whether
to stay in the race after consulting with his doctors about his
cancer treatment.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Chairman Choate Quits  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party Chairman Pat Choate resigned
Friday and turned control over to his vice chairman, citing an
illness in his family.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Moan of Tuscon, Ariz., will head the party until a new
chairman is selected at its summer convention, Choate said.
</P>
<P>
   Choate, the 1996 Reform Party vice presidential nominee, said in
a telephone interview with The Associated Press that the party is
united after months of wrangling, thus his departure will not be
unsettling. Former Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan,
recruited to the party by Choate, is the leading contender for the
third-party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've got things in good shape,'' Choate said. ''I
think we're on a glide path to the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Choate announced his resignation in a letter to the party's
executive council. The letter noted ''an illness in our family that
requires the immediate attention of my wife and me.'' He said in an
interview the illness was a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   Choate's claim to the job was challenged this year by rivals
within the party, but a federal judge upheld his chairmanship. His
first order of business was to try to soothe internal strife.
</P>
<P>
   Choate, 59, is no stranger to Washington or party politics. He
was party founder Ross Perot's running mate in 1996 when the two
got 8 percent of the national vote -- enough to secure $15 million
in public funding this year for the party's convention and general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, though he was not on the ticket, he helped
Perot secure 18 percent of the vote, a significant chunk that may
well have decided the election in Bill Clinton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Choate grew up in Red Oak, Texas, picking cotton on his father's
farm. After earning a doctorate from the University of Oklahoma in
1969, he moved to Washington to work for the Commerce Department.
He now lives on his own farm in Washington, Va., with his wife,
Kay.
</P>
<P>
   He has advised his friend Buchanan on foreign policy, and he
coached Perot before a 1993 debate with Gore over the North
American Free Trade Agreement. Choate argues that open markets have
cost millions of American jobs by forcing U.S. workers to compete
with cheap overseas labor.

<HEADLINE> Report: All 21 Hostages Alive  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Two days after Muslim rebels holed up
on this island claimed that two of their foreign hostages had died,
negotiators reportedly have confirmed that all 21 of the captives,
including 10 foreign tourists, are alive.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators have resumed contacts with the Abu Sayyaf
rebels, several villagers in touch with the negotiators said
Friday. The rebels were able to break through a military cordon and
were holding their hostages at a single location outside the area,
said the villagers, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Jolo hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French
nationals, two South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and one
Filipino. They were kidnapped April 23 from Sipadan Island, a
Malaysian diving resort, and taken by boat to Jolo, a southern
Philippine island about one hour away.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts between the kidnappers and negotiators were cut earlier
this week after hundreds of government troops encircled the area
where the hostages were being held in a simple bamboo hut. A series
of clashes erupted on Tuesday and Wednesday as the rebels tried to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the rebels claimed two of the foreign hostages had
died -- one from a stray bullet and one of a heart attack.
Government officials have said those claims were unconfirmed, and
troops who seized the bamboo hut said they found no bodies or
bloodstains.
</P>
<P>
   The government-appointed negotiators, led by former Muslim rebel
leader Nur Misuari, sent several representatives to meet quietly
with the kidnappers at their new hide-out on Thursday, the people
in touch with the negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   All 21 hostages were in the same house with the rebels, they
said, contradicting earlier reports that the hostages had been
divided into five groups. They said that on the basis of Thursday's
contact, a team of negotiators arrived Friday and planned to go
into the mountains to meet the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the rebels had threatened to behead two
foreign hostages if the military did not back off. A rebel leader,
Abu Escobar, said in a radio interview broadcast Friday that the
group is discussing whether to go through with the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see. If the situation remains, the surprise may
happen,'' he told DXRZ radio.
</P>
<P>
   The government reiterated Friday that the troops would stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two separatist Muslim rebel
groups seeking an independent Islamic nation in the impoverished
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The militants on Jolo are one of two groups of Abu Sayyaf rebels
holding hostages in the region. On the nearby island of Basilan,
other rebels had 27 Filipino hostages until Wednesday, when 15 of
the captives were rescued by government troops and four others were
killed -- reportedly shot in the back of their heads by their
captors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Basilan hostages were children, though the four who
died were adults. Survivors said some of the hostages were
regularly beaten during their seven weeks in captivity, and a
priest who was among the dead had been tortured.
</P>
<P>
   The Basilan rebels are believed to be holding the remaining
hostages. Troops were searching for them Friday.

<HEADLINE> Expectations High for Iran Run-Offs  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's
pro-democracy allies were expected to make a strong showing in
Friday's parliamentary run-off, despite a crackdown by hard-liners
determined to cling to power.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters randomly interviewed Friday in several
constituencies said they were voting for the moderates -- bad news
for hard-liners trying to mitigate a humiliating defeat in the Feb.
18 first round. In that balloting, reformists won some 70 percent
of races for the 290-seat parliament, or Majlis.
</P>
<P>
   The run-offs could seal the reformist victory or open the way to
more confrontation with the hard-liners, who have shown they won't
easily give up power. In the weeks before Friday's vote, the
hard-liners have closed 16 pro-democracy newspapers in Tehran,
arrested top liberal activists and annulled some of the reformists'
earlier election victories.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 132 candidates, six of them women, were competing for 66
seats in 52 constituencies in Friday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   So many Iranians turned out to vote that the 10-hour voting
period was extended up to two hours in some large constituencies,
state-run Tehran radio said. Results will be announced starting
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been in touch with several of the constituencies, and
all report strong showing for reformist forces,'' said Ahmad Azimi,
a reformist candidate running against a hard-liner for the single
seat in Shiraz, which already has sent three reformists to the
house in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the seats will be swept by the reformists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Jafar Moqtaderi, an attorney, said he wanted to vote
for the reformists ''because they can do more positive things for
the country. The country needs (them) at this juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, secretary of the Guardian Council, a
hard-line body that oversees elections, called on voters to pick
people who did not have ''anti-revolutionary'' thoughts -- a
reference to the reformists.
</P>
<P>
   Run-offs were needed in constituencies where no candidate
received the minimum 25 percent of votes. Only the two
front-runners from the last round can contest each seat. Voting in
constituencies where results were annulled was to take place at an
as-yet unscheduled time.
</P>
<P>
   No run-offs were being held Friday in the capital, Tehran.
Reformists won 29 of the 30 seats in Tehran, but the Guardian
Council has not yet declared results in the capital final.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners control the judiciary, military and
broadcasting. But controlling the Majlis is important because it
can grant greater political and social freedoms and pass laws that
would weaken hard-liners' hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners, who have controlled the house since the 1979
Islamic revolution, have become increasingly unpopular with a
predominantly young population that has backed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists fear that if the hard-liners suffer another setback
in the run-offs, they will try to delay the May 27 opening of the
Majlis, which constitutionally must be inaugurated on time except
in a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists say that by closing newspapers and detaining more
than a half-dozen Khatami allies, the hard-liners are trying to
provoke riots that would bring troops into the streets and create a
state of national emergency. That would give the hard-liners more
time to maneuver.

<HEADLINE> Norway Union Threatens Strike  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's biggest union said Friday that it
was expanding an ongoing strike into the largest labor conflict in
the nation since before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has affected businesses ranging from movie theaters
to the construction industry and has threatened auto production
lines in Europe because of a shortage of Norwegian-made parts.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians have begun hoarding food, beer, soft drinks, tobacco
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said 102,119 people would be on strike by Tuesday,
breaking the postwar record of 102,000 strikers in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in the biggest conflict in Norwegian postwar history,''
union leader Yngve Haagensen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The 800,000-member Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, an
umbrella organization for 27 unions, began the strike Wednesday
after its rank and file rejected a management offer of pay raises
of 3.5 to 4 percent and additional paid vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the Norwegian Confederation of Business and
Industry, a business group that negotiates with the union, have had
no formal contact since the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is also considered a protest against a growing gap
between the rich and average workers in egalitarian Norway, which
has a population of 4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, is enjoying an
unprecedented economic boom, and media have reported extensively on
the lavish compensation packages offered top business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The reports ran at a time when unions were being urged to show
moderation in their demands, and touched a nerve in Norway, where
the phrase ''share the wealth'' is a sort of national motto.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say no to one-sided moderation and have had enough of a
greedy leadership culture with fat (stock) options, golden
handshakes and salaries,'' said the union's official strike
handbill.
</P>
<P>
   The strike could affect the jobs of tens of thousands of

<HEADLINE> Former Philadelphia mob boss pleads guilty to murder  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Former Philadelphia mob boss Ralph Natale
appeared fit, tan and relaxed as he smiled and joked with his
attorney Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He answered questions from the judge about his health, his
mental state and his education.
</P>
<P>
   Then he calmly pleaded guilty to a three-decade criminal career
that included seven murders, four attempted murders, extortion,
gambling and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Natale, 65, also pleaded guilty to bribing the mayor of Camden --
himself under indictment -- conspiracy to distribute
methamphetamine, and murder in aid of racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Were these acts committed to further the aims of the
Philadelphia La Cosa Nostra?'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Barry Gross
asked Natale.
</P>
<P>
   ''They certainly were,'' Natale said.
</P>
<P>
   Natale, believed to be the highest-ranking mob boss ever to
cooperate with prosecutors, has been turning over mob compatriots
to the government since his arrest last summer on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   His help led to the indictment of reputed mob boss Joseph
''Skinny Joey'' Merlino and 10 others in March on charges of
murder, attempted murder, racketeering, extortion, and illegal
gambling. Natale, who ran the mob between 1994 and 1998, allegedly
appointed Merlino boss in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to have Natale testify against Camden
Mayor Milton Milan, who was recently charged with accepting money,
vacations, automobiles and home improvement work from Natale and
mob associates.
</P>
<P>
   Natale admitted using an associate to bribe Milan in return for
favors to mob-influenced businesses and contractors. He once
referred to the mayor as ''our guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The cooperation of this major underworld figure has broken the
mob structure and led us to some very fertile areas for further
investigation and prosecution,'' U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Natale's attorney, Marc Neff, said Natale hopes to get a reduced
sentence in exchange for his cooperation. Prosecutors said they
agreed to recommend a lighter sentence to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In court, though, U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas warned
Natale that he does not have to go along with the punishment
recommended by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't like my sentence, that's not a ground to withdraw
your plea,'' Irenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plea agreement is confidential, prosecutors said
Natale would be spared the death penalty. He could face up to life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino's attorney, Edwin Jacobs Jr., on Friday called Natale's
guilty pleas ''window dressing'' meant to bolster his credibility
as the ''knowledgeable head of organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The fly in their ointment is that he's doing all this for a
probable couple years in jail ... he could admit being responsible
for the Hindenburg disaster,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pinsky, lawyer for reputed South Philadelphia mobster
George Borgesi, who was indicted with Merlino, said he attended
Natale's hearing to ''watch the government make a deal with a
serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky and Jacobs said they plan to question Natale's motivation
for cooperating with the government at their clients' trials.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents accused Natale of orchestrating a racketeering
conspiracy that included murder, extortion, illegal gambling, drug
trafficking, stolen cars, loan sharking and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Natale, who had spent 24 years in the organization, took over
following his release from prison on racketeering and drug charges
in 1994, a year before former boss John Stanfa and seven others
were convicted of racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Natale was arrested by federal marshals in 1998 and charged with
parole violations. While still in prison, Natale was indicted in
June 1999 with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute
methamphetamine in Philadelphia and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Neff said Natale decided on his own to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a complex decision he had to make. He made it for a lot
of reasons and they were his reasons. Nobody's in a position to
tell him what to do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Reaches $10 Million Goal  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has reached his goal of raising
a fresh $10 million by the end of April, and he plans to keep going
in an effort that could give him a big summer spending advantage
over Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president can spend only around $9 million more in the
months before the Democrats' national convention in August under
the limits he agreed to in exchange for millions of dollars in
taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has not been accepting federal funds, can spend as
much as he can raise.
</P>
<P>
   That could give Bush, who already has spent a record $73 million
on his presidential campaign, a huge financial edge in the months
before the two men are nominated and become eligible for more
federal money. The Republicans' convention begins July 31 in
Philadelphia, the Democrats' Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a game where money is the ultimate decisive factor, it
should have some definite impact'' for Bush's campaign, Republican
consultant Eddie Mahe said. ''They basically can continue to put in
place a full-fledged, general-election campaign, getting offices
open, getting staff in place, getting them trained and getting
ready to campaign. They will not have to devote any of their
general election dollars to getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   After the conventions, Gore and Bush each will receive $67.6
million in federal funds and cannot raise any private money for
their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has shut down his fund-raising operation, Bush plans
a fund-raiser in Washington on May 22, a week after wife Laura
headlines an event in Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign began its latest round of fund raising in
March after depleting its initial $70 million bank account fighting
off a strong Republican primary challenge from Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Scott McClellan said the campaign, which had raised
around $6.4 million in March, took in more than $3.1 million
through April 27, bringing its record-setting total to around $83.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is going to have more than enough resources to
continue talking about his bipartisan message of changing the tone
in Washington and setting the record straight about Al Gore's
exaggerations and distortions of the governor's record,'' McClellan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge they will be outspent, but insist they
have the issues on their side and enough money to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has a much stronger message, whether it's on
common-sense gun safety, real investments in education, real
investments in health care, and our approach to Social Security,''
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. ''We have enough resources to
accomplish our goals, which are to focus on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Democratic National Committee, which aired
issue ads in support of President Clinton four years ago, could
help fill the financial gap by financing a round of advertising in
support of Gore. The Democrats outraised the Republican National
Committee during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore has plenty of money to get through the convention,''
Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said. ''If there's an air war that
occurs, what you have is a situation where the party committees
take on that job. I really wouldn't worry too much about the
minimal disparity that will occur in the next couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both presidential candidates are out raising money
for their political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore raised $1.2 million for the Democratic National Commttee in
Chicago on Thursday and is scheduled to headline fund-raisers next
week in New York and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Bush-headlined event in California raised $3.25
million to be split between the state GOP and the Republican
National Committee. Bush is scheduled to do a fund-raiser in
Pennsylvania Monday in which the proceeds also will be divided
between the state and national parties.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a new effort by Bush to raise money for his party.
The push began last month when the Texas governor helped the
national committee raise a record $21.5 million at its annual
black-tie dinner.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Dems Trade Barbs Over Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House Republican accused the Census Bureau
director of joining congressional Democrats in partisan attacks
against the GOP, just as census-takers fan out across the country
to find people who didn't return a form.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Friday of the House Government Reform Committee's
census panel, the chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., said director
Kenneth Prewitt was ''attempting to politicize the census at this
crucial period in time'' by wrongly criticizing comments by several
Republicans on the intrusiveness of census long forms.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he was never critical of GOP leadership, adding
that politicians on both sides of the aisle may have failed in the
past to capitalize on opportunities to encourage participation.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, just as the Census Bureau was urging Americans to
return forms, some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the party's
presumptive presidential nominee, questioned the intrusiveness of
the 53-question long form.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have said that national public voices have undermined the
seriousness of the census at a key period,'' Prewitt said. ''We
missed that opportunity in that key week'' to capitalize on the
importance of the census, and instead officials were left to answer
criticism about intrusive questions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the subcommittee's ranking
Democrat, said the GOP is partly to blame for heightened concerns
over privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans didn't decide to support this campaign, but go
negative,'' Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by InterSurvey found the number of Americans
concerned about census intrusiveness doubled from 10 percent to 20
percent between March 3, just as forms were being mailed out, and
April 13, near the end of the Census Bureau's push to get forms
back.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said the poll also proves that concern over the long
form is not politically driven, since the figure reached 18 percent
by March 26 -- days before Lott's and Bush's comments became public.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 66 percent of the 120 million forms mailed out have been
returned. The Census Bureau is trying to track down homes that did
not mail one back in an operation ending July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said that operation, which requires sending out 440,000
part-time census-takers was going well so far, and there were few
reports of people hostile toward his workers.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani has new TV ad; candidates prepare for Liberals  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani launched a new
television advertisement Friday, an indication he has not yet
decided if he should give up his Senate campaign against Hillary
Rodham Clinton because of his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign aides said the latest ad would air statewide
for about two weeks at a cost that could top $1 million. The mayor
has had campaign ads running off and on for months.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's campaign launched its first statewide TV ad
this week, also for a two-week run. It is expected to cost about
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the new TV ads attacks the opposing candidate,
although Giuliani's has thinly veiled barbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be a senator because I was born in this state,'' the
ad shows the mayor saying during a recent campaign speech in
Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The moment serves two purposes -- to reinforce Clinton's
''carpetbagger'' image and to demonstrate that the mayor does make
campaign stops in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republican leaders have been grumbling that Giuliani
hasn't been spending enough time in the traditionally more
conservative region of the state that provides 45 percent of the
vote in statewide elections. Meanwhile, Clinton has been
crisscrossing the region. On Thursday, she visited Clinton County
in far northern New York to complete a tour of all 62 New York
counties in the 10 months since she began actively campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how many counties she goes to, there's only one real
New Yorker in this race,'' Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim
Serafin said Friday. Serafin said she was uncertain how many
counties the mayor had visited since he began campaigning last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Giuliani campaign announcement Thursday that the ad buy was
being postponed in deference to Cardinal John O'Connor's death had
touched off new speculation that the mayor had decided to drop out
of the race. The mayor's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, denied
that. The campaign later said the ad would begin airing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has said he will decide before the end of May whether
he will stay in the race after consulting with his doctors about
his cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The new Giuliani ad appeared as he and Clinton prepared for
Saturday interviews in New York City with the Liberal Party's
policy committee. The party's full state committee is expected to
make its endorsement in two weeks. The one-hour, separate morning
interviews are not open to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers hold out little hope they can win the Liberal
Party nod given that party boss Raymond Harding is one the mayor's
closest political advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need all these third-party lines,'' a defiant state
Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said Tuesday on MSNBC's
''Hardball'' program.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview with The Associated Press, Hope said
that while chances of a Clinton endorsement by the Liberal Party
were 'remote ... we assume that none of these institutions are
monolithic and you never know what's around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spokeswoman Serafin noted Friday that no Democrat has
been elected governor or senator in New York without Liberal Party
backing since the party's founding in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   But some Liberal Party members said the Giuliani forces
shouldn't count on walking off with the party's endorsement. They
said it could go to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely going to be a dogfight, but I'm really very
confident -- very, very confident,'' said Clinton supporter Joe
Laux, a Liberal Party vice chairman and a member of its policy
committee that will interview the candidates Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, President and Mrs. Clinton are to attend a
wedding in Arkansas. On Sunday, she will attend a fund-raising
event in Little Rock for her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of nose-tweaking, Giuliani went to Arkansas last July
for his own fund raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never lived here, I've never worked here, I've never gone
to school here. It's the first time I've been here,'' he told his
Little Rock audience at the time. ''I guess it would be cool to run
for the Senate.''

<HEADLINE> Rwandans, Ugandans Clash in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Ugandan and Rwandan troops clashed in
Congo on Friday, killing at least 10 civilians and wounding 100 in
fighting that drew sharp criticism from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan forces sprayed the northern city of Kisangani with
mortars and anti-aircraft fire, then attacked Rwandan positions at
the main airport at Bangoka, said Lt. Col. Akram Hossain, head of a
four-man U.N. monitoring team in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers in telephone communication with Kisangani from
eastern Congo said a building housing Doctors Without Borders, an
international humanitarian aid group, took a direct hit and was in
flames, as was the local electric company.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro, the Rwandan army spokesman, said Rwandan
units destroyed two Ugandan tanks during fighting for the airport,
but were under orders not to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the National Resistance Movement, Uganda's dominant
political force, accused Rwandan army units of starting the battle
by firing on troops withdrawing from the Simi-Simi airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandans and Rwandans are in Congo to back rival rebel
groups opposed to President Laurent Kabila and his supporters from
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. Hundreds of Rwandan and Ugandan
troops died when the two forces clashed in a four-day battle in
Kisangani last August.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement faxed to news agencies in Nairobi, the National
Resistance Movement said Rwanda had deployed reinforcements in
Kisangani in violation of the truce that ended last summer's
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsangani is a strategically important Congo River port. Its
decaying but functioning roads and airports are used to transport
troops as well as Congolese gold, diamonds and timber.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fighting threatens the fragile alliance in an
18-month war against Kabila, just as the United Nations stepped up
efforts to deploy a 5,500-strong U.N. observer force to oversee the
withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is
leading a U.N. Security Council delegation visiting Congo and other
regional capitals in an effort to secure agreement on a U.N.
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no way anyone can interpret this action as good
news,'' Holbrooke said of the fighting. ''Does it directly threaten
dialogue between the two sides? It enormously complicates it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We deplore and more than deplore this action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the Security Council issued a
toughly worded statement Friday calling for an end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Security Council condemns unreservedly the outbreak of
military hostilities in Kisangani. The council is also concerned by
reports of the killing of innocent Congolese civilians,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Hossain, speaking by telephone from Kisangani, said Rwandans
were erecting defensive positions in the city in anticipation of a
Ugandan move against the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan artillery, meanwhile, pounded the city with 120mm
caliber mortar shells from the Kapalata military camp on the
eastern side of Tshopo River, which they captured last month over
Rwandan protests, Hossain said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda requested an urgent meeting with regional heads of state
to resolve the crisis, Ndahiro said, hoping to involve the
presidents of Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Ndahiro, the Rwandan army spokesman, said Rwandan officials had
contacted Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni as well as the United
States, Tanzania and South Africa for help in ending the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to defuse things. We have no reason to fight with
Ugandans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A peace agreement was signed among the warring sides last summer
and renewed April 14 when they agreed to allow the United Nations
to deploy the U.N. observer mission in four locations across Congo,
including Kisangani.

Schumer says only locally generated nuclear waste at FitzPatrick
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) -- Federal regulators have given their
assurances that the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear plant will not
become a dump for the country's radioactive waste when the Lake
Ontario plant begins using dry-cask storage next year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said that pledge was among the most
important pieces of information that came out of a meeting Thursday
in Washington, D.C., involving top officials at the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, four Oswego County legislators Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of our nuclear sites in Oswego can become a place where
outside nuclear waste can be shipped to,'' Schumer said. ''Under
the present statutes and regulations, that cannot happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the new owner of the plant tries to change that, the county
''would have ample notice and could fight it,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue during the three-hour meeting were the New York Power
Authority's plans to store spent nuclear fuel in outdoor casks at
the FitzPatrick plant in Scriba beginning next year. The outdoor
storage is needed because the plant's indoor storage pools are
almost filled to capacity, according to the authority.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Corp. of Louisiana, which is poised to buy the plant,
has said it will follow through with the storage plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has raised health and safety concerns among local
residents, some of whom fear the site could become a dumping ground
for nuclear waste from other power plants.
</P>
<P>
   FitzPatrick has received general approval from the NRC to use
dry-cask storage, but it has not applied for approval of a specific
plan for carrying out the storage, Schumer said. When the plant's
owner does that, the county will be notified and will have a chance
to comment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   NRC officials also promised to meet in Oswego soon to give the
public an opportunity to ask questions, Schumer said. The date is
not set.

<HEADLINE> Thirty-eight indicted after drug raids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ONEONTA, N.Y. (AP) -- Local, state and federal police officers
pulled off raids in two counties Friday, charging 38 people with
selling $3.6 million worth of crack cocaine over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five of the 38 were arrested and three remained at large
after the 6 a.m. raids in Otsego and Delaware counties.
</P>
<P>
   Otsego County District Attorney Jack Gibbons said leads
developed over the past five years brought all the police agencies
together for Friday's combined effort to target cocaine sales in
the two counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably the largest number of bodies that we've
collected at any one time,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   The 38 face federal charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
Several defendants also face charges of selling cocaine and
firearms possession.
</P>
<P>
   During the raids, police recovered two pounds of crack cocaine
and an AK-47 assault-style weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the suspects were arraigned in U.S. District Court in
Binghamton. Others were scheduled to be arraigned in other
jurisdictions including New York City, Seattle and Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 165; Nasdaq Up 96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Renewed enthusiam for technology issues
propelled the stock market higher today, helping investors overlook
the latest sign that the economy is growing too fast for the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 165.37 to close at
10,577.86 and the Nasdaq composite index gained 96.51 to close at
3,816.75.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the solid rally, both the Dow and the Nasdaq finished
the week with losses. The Dow fell 156.05 points during the week
while the Nasdaq lost 43.91 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 23.25 to 1,432.63 today.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,675 up, 1,276 down and 475
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 796.33 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
909.89 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.92 to
512.83.
</P>
<P>
   Today's rally surprised analysts who expected the market to fall
in the wake of an exceptionally strong employment report, which
raised expectations of a big increase in interest rates later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate fell in
April to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent. Most analysts had
expected a 4.0 reading.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 percent in April to $13.64, twice as fast as many analysts
were predicting. Economists believe that rising wage pressures
provide the strongest impetus for the Federal Reserve to continue
raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Today's report strengthened the case for a half-percentage point
increase at the Fed's May 16 meeting. The Fed has raised rates five
times since last June, but all have been modest, quarter-point
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some consensus in the stock market that the Fed will
raise interest rates a half-point in May and the market is prepared
for that,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. But he said today's strong report raised questions about
whether the Fed will follow up with another big increase in June.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, seemed to brush off concerns about higher
interest rates and continued to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already seen a lot of damage in this market. We had a
vicious shakeout about a month ago,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Now, they can throw bad news at
us and we won't react as badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, as investors poured
money into the sector, believing that rapid growth will equip those
companies to best handle a spate of interest rate increases.
Applied Materials and JDS Uniphase rose.
</P>
<P>
   Computer networking provider Cisco Systems was the most active
Nasdaq stock, rising after it agreed to acquire Arrowpoint
Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the strongest Dow component.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose in advance of a 3-for-1 stock split due to
take effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet retailers rose after Lehman Brothers initiated
coverage of the sector. Amazon.com rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''The larger companies with established brands and critical mass
should continue to evolve into world-class commerce platforms with
highly profitable business models,'' Lehman analyst Holly Becker
told clients.
</P>
<P>
   Volume hit its lowest levels in a quiet week. Analysts said some
traders have opted to head to the sidelines while the market
digested the latest slate of economic news.

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Plan To Test Teachers  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLT, Mich. (AP) -- Al Gore advanced a campaign plan for teacher
testing and firing Friday and tested his own teaching skills,
pronouncing computer-assisted geometry ''pretty complicated'' but
movie trivia a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's daylong interaction with Holt High School students near
Lansing produced some unscripted insights into the usually scripted
Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In physics class, he gave Stephen Baker something to think about
after the 17-year-old bluntly put down scientists' theories of the
universe's formation. Baker said he was a creationist who believed
God made the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they're inconsistent,'' Gore told the boy. ''I
think you can be a person of faith and still believe in scientific
processes.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Shavonne Singleton, 16, and Mark McGarry,
18, from the school newspaper, Gore was asked what sports he played
in high school. His reply: ''Football, basketball, track and art.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his most memorable high school moment, Gore said: ''Ohh,
oooo. Taking a long jump shot at the buzzer -- the final buzzer --
ending the basketball game.'' When his interviewer didn't follow up
and ask about the outcome, the famously competitive Gore found an
excuse to add, ''I must confess that that long shot I sank went off
the backboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher quality was the issue in an afternoon address to the
Michigan Education Association, a teachers union backing Gore's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   He called for salary increases for qualified teachers, and $8
billion over 10 years in signing bonuses and other incentives to
recruit 1 million new teachers. But he also offered a proposal to
impose conditions for receiving federal aid, including teacher
testing, certification and, in cases of irreversible failure,
firing.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we absolutely must respect due process, we have to put
an end to endless delays in removing those few teachers who really
do need to be removed,'' Gore told union members equipped with
posters declaring ''NEA Supports Gore 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He also urged creation of national standards that all new
teachers would have to meet or states would lose Title 1 money
aimed at helping them educate poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore argued it will be easier to win congressional support for
more education spending ''if the American people believe that new
accountability and new reforms are definitely going to produce new
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Brennan, the five-year teaching veteran who shared her
classroom with Gore, said teachers, despite their unions'
traditional resistance to testing and firing mandates, are now more
receptive to ideas for school improvement. ''People are very open
and want to discuss these kinds of issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, said Gore's ''campaign promises ring hollow'' given
that the administration has threatened to veto a bipartisan,
$2-billion teacher quality package that passed the House last year
and would require a qualified teacher in every classroom in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Going from classroom to lunchroom to library in casual attire
and cowboy boots, Gore encountered some teen-agers in this
predominantly white school who were evidently outfitted to shock: a
girl with neon-pink spiked hair and dog collar, a boy whose T-shirt
read ''Hooters girls dig me,'' and a boy in the cafeteria who
hoisted a ''Bush for President'' poster.
</P>
<P>
   A computer-aided geometry project to design novel soccer balls
confounded Gore, who shook his head at students working with
keyboards, tape and Exacto knives, which weren't, to the students'
astonishment, confiscated by Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''That sounds pretty complicated,'' Gore marveled. ''This sounds
pretty complex.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more at home co-teaching Brennan's 10th grade American
history class, where he probed students' thoughts on segregation
and shared some personal experiences with racism from his boyhood
in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Christina Renfro, 17, pronounced him knowledgeable
but didn't give him too much credit. ''Him being the vice president
and all, he should know some stuff.'' What made him a good teacher,
the girl said, was ''he's calm and rational, which is a good thing
when you're dealing with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   On his fourth intensive ''school day'' of the spring campaign --
his second in the battleground state of Michigan -- Gore proved
himself well-versed in the slapstick, teen film genre.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dumb and Dumber,'' he reminded one student who was analyzing
the movie, included a character who stuck his tongue to a frozen
pole. National Lampoon's ''European Vacation'' wasn't his favorite,
Gore said. And he didn't like ''Vegas Vacation'' at all.
</P>
<P>
   As for the original ''Vacation'' starring Chevy Chase, Gore
quoted a favorite line: ''I don't know why they call this stuff
Hamburger Helper; it's great by itself.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge To Weigh Victims' Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Switzerland's two largest banks confirmed Friday
that they have told a federal judge they will grant access to
databases containing 2.1 million Holocaust-era accounts in a
compromise to speed payments to heirs of Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Edward Korman, who has to weigh the overall fairness of a
$1.25 billion out-of-court settlement before payments can start,
was presented with the agreement from Credit Suisse Group AG and
UBS AG on Thursday, said bank spokesmen in Switzerland, confirming
a report in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ''All parties have an interest in seeing that the settlement
receives approval as soon as possible,'' said Christoph Meier of
UBS.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ulrich Pfister of Credit Suisse said they expected a
decision from Korman soon on the bank part of the settlement.
Kormer must also rule on how the money is to be distributed, but
that is expected later, with all sides hoping that payments to
heirs can begin this year.
</P>
<P>
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, who headed an
independent panel that investigated Holocaust-era accounts,
supports the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic outline of what the two Swiss banks are talking
about is exactly what we've been talking about and proposing,''
Volcker said.
</P>
<P>
   Korman and Volcker are expected to decide on how much
information the banks should make available to match against
claims, as agreed to in the settlement reached in August 1998
between Swiss banks and Holocaust victims and their heirs, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Volcker said he held out hope that other Swiss banks would also
make their databases available.

<HEADLINE> Critics: Air Bag Rules May Be Risky  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced new air bag standards
Friday that seek to improve protection of children and small
adults. Critics contend larger adults who don't wear seat belts
could be put at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule overhauls the government's standards for air bags,
which to date are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives and
blamed for at least 158 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants
in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather
than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph standard will be phased in over three years, starting
with 2004 model year vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and
small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags
that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph test will not require the air bags to inflate as
forcefully as a 30 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, we focused on the most vulnerable and
the most at-risk of being killed by the air bags that were supposed
to benefit them,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups say the new standard will put more adults
at risk because the bags will not be designed to deploy with enough
force to protect unbelted larger adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a 30 mph standard because people are more likely to be
killed or seriously injured in higher-speed crashes, and this is
where air bags have saved the most lives,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA required a 30 mph test until 1997, when worries about air
bags injuring motorists caused the agency to approve a rule that
temporarily allowed automakers to use a 25 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than change the test, Claybrook said automakers should
install dual-power air bags that would inflate at different speeds
depending on the severity of impact and size of the occupant.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason the auto industry wants the 25 mph test,
Claybrook said, is that popular sport utility vehicles cannot meet
the 30 mph standard because of stiff designs that do not absorb
impact as well as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers
rejected that argument. If it were true, he said, the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trauma Society and the
National Transportation Safety Board would not support the 25 mph
test as the safer alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly not about saving money or about protecting any
classification of vehicle,'' Roberts said. ''This rule is going to
go so much further in enhancing vehicle safety, it's
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also will require vehicles to be tested using a family of
dummies -- an average-size man, a small woman and 1-, 3- and
6-year-old children. Previous tests involved only average-size men.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world
conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger
seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying
positions.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA estimates the new standards will increase costs by less
than $100 per vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Lebanon To Hold Fire  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- After two days of tit-for-tat attacks
that killed an Israeli soldier and two Lebanese civilians, Lebanese
guerrillas and Israel both said Friday they would hold their fire.
</P>
<P>
   The separate announcements came after Israeli warplanes left a
deep crater in the highway from Beirut to the Syrian capital of
Damascus on Friday and knocked out power stations in the Beirut
suburb of Bsaleem and in the northern port city of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of retaliatory strikes -- the worst in nearly a
a year -- began Thursday when two Lebanese women were killed in
shelling by Israel's allied militia in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah responded with its fierce rocket attack on Israel's
northern border, killing a soldier and wounding 26 other people.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continued Friday, with Israel bombing major Lebanese
cities and Shiite Muslim guerrillas sending more rockets into
northern Israel. Israel briefly responded before deciding during a
closed-door, high-level meeting not to retaliate because no one had
been killed in the Friday morning rocket attack.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan issued statements urging both sides to stop the
fighting. The statements blamed neither side.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned that Syria would not be
immune from attacks if the Lebanese guerrillas it backs continue to
rocket Israeli towns after Israel withdraws its forces from Lebanon
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa condemned the Israeli
attacks in telephone conversations with Albright and Annan, Syria's
official news agency SANA reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attacks Friday, Lebanese, raised on civil war and
regular Israeli air raids, carried on nearly as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ''Power cuts? We are used to power cuts,'' said Hermineh
Aslanian, a jewelry store owner in the capital's commercial Bourj
Hammoud district.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli strikes were harmful because they came on the eve
of the summer season during which Lebanese expatriates and foreign
tourists visit Lebanon and spend a lot of money,'' said Mustafa
Asfahani, 40, who owns a Persian carpet shop in the shopping
district of Hamra.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese have lived through a devastating 1975-90 civil war and
Israeli raids in 1999 and 1996 that destroyed power stations. As a
result, few homes or businesses lack their own source of
electricity through private generators or neighborhood services.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't affected because things are available for us and we
are used to it -- the power cuts,'' said Fadi Qadi, 29, who lives in
a building that has its own generator.
</P>
<P>
   The Damascus-Beirut highway was reopened to normal traffic after
swift repairs late Friday. Children in Beirut went to school even
as jets could be heard overhead. Traffic was stifling as usual and
most businesses opened, although many reported fewer customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are afraid that the cycle of violence might continue,''
said Darwish Samouri, owner of a women's clothing shop.
</P>
<P>
   George Mouawad, director general of the Electricity Company,
said power would be rationed once again in Beirut and other areas
because six new transformers at Bsaleem were destroyed. Mouawad
said installations in Tripoli would take up to two years to fix.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Philly Mob Boss Pleas Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Former Philadelphia mob boss Ralph Natale
calmly pleaded guilty Friday to a three-decade criminal career that
included seven murders, four attempted murders, extortion, gambling
and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Were these acts committed to further the aims of the
Philadelphia La Cosa Nostra?'' federal prosecutor Barry Gross asked
Natale.
</P>
<P>
   ''They certainly were,'' answered Natale, believed to be the
highest-ranking mob boss ever to cooperate with prosecutors,
</P>
<P>
   Natale, 65, also pleaded guilty to bribing the mayor of Camden,
conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and murder in aid of
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Natale, who ran the Philadelphia mob from 1994 until 1998, has
been turning over compatriots to the government since his arrest
last summer on drug charges. His help led to the indictment of his
reputed successor, Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino, and 10 others in
March on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to have Natale testify against Mayor
Milton Milan, who in March was charged with accepting money,
vacations, automobiles and home improvement work from Natale and
mob associates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cooperation of this major underworld figure has broken the
mob structure and led us to some very fertile areas for further
investigation and prosecution,'' U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Natale could face up to life in prison. Prosecutors said he
would be spared the death penalty. A sentencing date was not set.
</P>
<P>
   Natale's attorney, Marc Neff, said Natale hopes to get a reduced
sentence in exchange for his cooperation. Prosecutors said they
agreed to recommend a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In court, though, U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas warned
Natale that he does not have to go along with the punishment
recommended by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't like my sentence, that's not a ground to withdraw
your plea,'' Irenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino's attorney, Edwin Jacobs Jr., on Friday called Natale's
guilty pleas ''window dressing'' meant to bolster his credibility
as the ''knowledgeable head of organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The fly in their ointment is that he's doing all this for a
probable couple years in jail ... he could admit being responsible
for the Hindenburg disaster,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pinsky, lawyer for reputed South Philadelphia mobster
George Borgesi, who was indicted with Merlino, said he attended
Natale's hearing to ''watch the government make a deal with a
serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky and Jacobs said they plan to question Natale's motivation
for cooperating with the government at their clients' trials.

<HEADLINE> Street, Park Named for Elian's Mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIALEAH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- An 11-block stretch of a street and
an adjacent park were dedicated Friday to Elian Gonzalez's mother,
who drowned in November trying to reach the United States from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, great-uncle of the 6-year-old boy, and the
mayors of three suburban Miami cities attended the ceremony
honoring Elisabeth Brotons.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque will be placed at the park along a canal
''acknowledging the ultimate sacrifice that this mother had done
for her son to live in a democratic and free country,'' Mayor
Fatima Morejon said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elian is living in Maryland with his father while his
Miami relatives appeal for asylum for the boy, Morejon said she
hopes the boy can stay in the United States ''and make the wish
happen for the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Brotons is considered a hero in South Florida's Cuban-American
community for dying along with 10 others while attempting a
crossing from Cuba to Florida. Elian and two others survived.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels were holding an
estimated 300 U.N. hostages Friday after seizing a contingent of
troops along with their armored vehicles in another devastating
blow to U.N. peacekeeping efforts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopter surveillance showed rebels manning some of the 13
armored personnel carriers -- emblazoned with the U.N. logo on the
side -- that were commandeered over the past two days from the
208-man Zambian battalion, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said he couldn't confirm if the rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front were using the captured U.N. vehicles to
head toward Freetown, the capital, or if they were remaining in the
interior of the country where they were spotted.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures capped a week of daily U.N. hostage-taking by RUF
rebels, who were known during Sierra Leone's bloody civil war for
their brutal attacks on civilians that left thousands dead and tens
of thousands more with their arms and legs hacked off.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first detained were six U.N. civilians -- a four-man
U.N. helicopter crew and two passengers -- who were released Friday
from Kailahun in the east. Liberian President Charles Taylor, a
longtime ally of rebel leader Foday Sankoh, interceded with Sankoh
to call for their release.
</P>
<P>
   There was no discussion yet whether the United Nations would
evacuate any of its 8,700-strong peacekeeping force or its civilian
staff in Freetown. Negotiations were instead focusing on sending in
reinforcements and rounding up regional political pressure on
Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned that this week's attacks
could imperil U.N. peacekeeping on the continent in the same way
that the West shied away from African intervention after 18
Americans were killed in a botched U.S. raid in Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest concern is the new U.N. observer mission for the
Congo, where questions were raised about the deployment after
clashes Friday between Rwandan and Ugandan troops.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who was in the Congolese
capital Kinshasa on Friday with a delegation of Security Council
ambassadors, said ''the situation in Sierra Leone is a lot more
serious than the one here.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission for Sierra Leone was dispatched beginning in
December to oversee the peace agreement that ended a brutal
eight-year civil war that left the country in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A power-sharing peace agreement was reached last July between
the government and the RUF, but this week's fighting has threatened
that shaky peace.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF claims the clashes began because peacekeepers were
forcibly disarming RUF fighters -- a charge U.N. officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kenyan U.N. peacekeepers are believed to have been killed
in the clashes and 12 have been injured, Eckhard said. Six rebels
were killed, RUF spokesman Eldred Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard estimated that the total number of hostages stood Friday
at around 300. The bulk of that number was from the Zambian
contingent that was disarmed and detained en route Wednesday and
Thursday from the coastal town of Lungi to the central town of
Makeni to reinforce peacekeepers who had come under attack there
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels commandeered 13 of the Zambian's 16 armored personnel
carriers, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 100 or more Nigerians were detained in Kambia, in
the northwest, then released without their weapons or uniforms in
Port Loko to the south, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard stressed that the U.N. troops had a mandate to use
deadly force to protect themselves and civilians in imminent danger
-- but that any decision on that would be made by the force
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ''The emphasis is not to go to war with the RUF,'' he told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, however, has said the ''ideal'' way to deal with the
situation would be to mobilize a rapid-reaction force to move into
Sierra Leone to reinforce the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and France have been approached but
have not offered any ground troops. Britain has agreed to provide a
technical support team to help with logistics planning in Freetown,
the British Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF, meanwhile, denied it held any hostages and suggested
instead that the U.N. troops may have gotten ''lost in the bush''
during fighting in Makeni and Magburaka, where the first clashes
were reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh ''has ordered his field commander ... to organize a
search party for the missing U.N. peacekeepers,'' RUF spokesman
Gibril Massaquoi said in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictions are common with the RUF and Sankoh, an
unpredictable and mercurial leader seen as a near-deity by many of
his followers.

<HEADLINE> Turk Blamed in Pope Shooting Freed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A Turk once accused in the 1981 shooting
of Pope John Paul II was released from jail Friday pending trial on
charges of loan sharking, the Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Oral Celik was arrested after an Istanbul businessman complained
to authorities that Celik and four other men had threatened him
over repayment of a loan. Celik spent one night in jail and then
posted an $800 bail.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Celik has been detained by police several times since returning
to Turkey in early 1999 after spending four years in a Swiss prison
for drug smuggling. He is currently on trial for allegedly
kidnapping and raping a Russian dancer and faces 12 years in prison
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet Ali Agca, another Turk, is serving a life sentence for
shooting and seriously injuring the pope in a 1981 attack in Rome.
An Italian court acquitted Celik in 1982 of charges of conspiring
to kill the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Agca and Celik were accused of murdering liberal newspaper
editor Abdi Ipekci in 1979. Agca, who testified against Celik, was
convicted but later escaped from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Celik was acquitted of Ipekci's murder due to lack of evidence.

<HEADLINE> Linkletter Seeks Estate Tax Repeal  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At 87, entertainer Art Linkletter isn't
thinking about slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I travel 200,000 miles a year. I speak 70 times a year. I
write a book about every three years. I've got 26 books I've
written. I run five businesses. I sit on boards of directors. I'm a
regent at Pepperdine University,'' the showbiz legend continued on
and on, naming other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He added a new one Friday: Washington anti-tax crusader.
</P>
<P>
   Linkletter, speaking at a news conference on Capitol Hill on
behalf of the conservative United Seniors Association Inc., called
for the elimination of the federal estate tax, also called
''inheritance'' or ''death'' taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes paid on inheritances from parent to child range from 18
percent to 55 percent on estates up to $10 million, with everything
above that taxed at 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's immoral,'' said Linkletter, whose television show
''People Are Funny'' ran for 10 years starting in 1955, and his
daytime ''House Party,'' which included the segment ''Kids Say the
Darndest Things'' appeared on CBS for 26 years. ''Why should people
who've spent their lives trying to assemble something have it all
taken away when they pay taxes on it all the way through?''
</P>
<P>
   Rich people hire lawyers to find ways around the taxes, so it
primarily effects the middle and lower-classes, he said. House
Republicans plan to bring up a measure this summer to slowly phase
out estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Linkletter, a conservative Republican who was ambassador to
Australia under President Reagan, also said he plans to support
Texas Gov. George Bush for president. ''I generally approve of what
he's been doing,'' Linkletter said. ''I think (Vice President Al)
Gore's a good guy and OK but I think we've had that kind of party
operating long enough as president.''

<HEADLINE> American Legion vice commander, 9 others, charged in drug case  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- The vice commander of an American Legion
post here and nine others were arrested Friday, charged with
dealing drugs near the post building and at its bar.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Madden, 52, who also was a post bartender, was charged
with distributing marijuana and other offenses. Nine other people,
mostly neighborhood residents, were charged with distributing
cocaine and related counts as a result of a three month undercover
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the suspects each face up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities said neighbors tipped them off to
possible drug dealing in the area around the post building, a
modest, two-story white house nestled in a residential neighborhood
in the university town.
</P>
<P>
   Their probe soon centered around the post bar, where undercover
agents twice bought small amounts of cocaine and marijuana,
Princeton Borough Police Chief Thomas Michaud said.
</P>
<P>
   Police bought less than one half ounce of marijuana and less
than 50 grams of cocaine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Madden was released on $7,000 cash bail. Michaud said the
suspect fought with police when they apprehended him driving a car
in South Brunswick. He had a small amount of cocaine when caught,
the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud, a former legion member himself, said the arrest of the
vice commander should not taint the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American Legion is not in the business of dealing drugs. I
don't want the name of the American Legion to be sullied,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities were not sure whether any of the
other suspects belonged to the post, or were guests. No one
answered the door or the phone at the post Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A bumper sticker on the post door says ''Welcome Home America's
Finest'' and warns that only members and guests can enter.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, who Michaud said is a carpenter at Princeton University,
could not be reached for comment Friday. No one answered the door
to his home or returned telephone messages left on his answering
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud said he was unsure which branch of the military Madden
served in.
</P>
<P>
   A post neighbor, Mary Trotman, 48, who said she grew up with
Madden, described him as a ''friendly, nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised, especially given how old he is,'' she said.
''This is not supposed to happen here, in Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   County Prosecutor Daniel Giaquinto said the arrest shows that
suburban drug dealers should not rest easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at suburban drug dealing as closely as we do in
the inner city,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congo Sentences Ex-Premier to Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) -- A court in the Republic of Congo has
sentenced former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas to death in
absentia for a range of crimes, including torturing and raping
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes allegedly took place during the nation's five-month
civil war in 1997 when Kolelas fought alongside then-President
Pascal Lissouba against a rebel movement led by the current
president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic of the Congo lies to the north and west of the much
larger Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was handed down Thursday after a brief trial in the
capital, Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty plaintiffs accused Kolelas and his nephew Phillipe
Bikinkita, a former interior minister, of ordering or personally
committing the crimes in special detention cells for his personal
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Bikinkita also was sentenced to death. Both men live in exile in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During the proceedings, which were broadcast live on state
television and radio, Beti Matoumpa described how she was forced
nude into a cell of nude men. She was later raped by Kolelas, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were arrested on charges of being sympathizers of
Sassou-Nguesso, whose Cobra militia force ousted Lissouba's elected
government in 1997 with the help of troops from neighboring Angola.
He later declared himself president.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has gripped the attention of residents of Brazzaville,
many of whom are still recovering from the devastating war, when
the capital was split into rival zones. At least 2,000 people were
killed in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Howdy Doody Custody Argued in Court  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A peanut gallery of lawyers and reporters
watched on Friday as an art museum and the family of a Howdy Doody
puppeteer argued over who gets custody of TV's freckle-faced
marionette.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Institute of Arts claimed that puppeteer Rufus Rose
promised to give the original Howdy Doody to the museum. The Rose
family argued that no such promise was ever made and that the
puppet they have may not even be the original.
</P>
<P>
   Several copies of Howdy Doody were made, including a stunt
''Double Doody.'' The puppet in question, estimated to be worth
$50,000, is being stored in a bank vault in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney gave lawyers two weeks to
submit written arguments. No date was set for a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is based on correspondence between Rose and Buffalo
Bob Smith, the host of ''The Howdy Doody Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Smith wanted to visit college campuses and
military bases with the puppet, Rose said he would lend him ''the
one and only original Howdy.'' In the letter, Rose said NBC gave
him the marionette with the provision that Howdy eventually be
placed in the Detroit museum.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rose's family argued that there is no documentation
between Rose and NBC to confirm such an understanding existed.
</P>
<P>
   Rose died in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Testimony Ends 1st Week  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH, Associated press Writer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Lawyers for two Libyans accused
of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland began building a defense
Friday by getting a police witness to confirm a Palestinian group
was initially suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The first week of testimony at a special court in the
Netherlands ended with the names of 270 victims of the Dec. 21,
1988, bombing read aloud into the court record.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in the public gallery wept or held photographs of the
victims during the hourlong recital of names, ages and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The two defendants, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, who wore white prayer robes and caps to court on
Friday for the Muslim Sabbath, have pleaded innocent. If convicted,
they will be sent to a Scottish prison for life.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examining prosecution witnesses, defense lawyers laid
the foundation for the main defense line -- that a case could be
made against others besides the Libyan defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has said it intends to implicate 10 individuals in
two radical Palestinian groups, hoping to create enough doubt to
win a verdict of ''not proven''-- tantamount to an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Ferrie, a Scottish detective chief inspector, said a
Syrian-backed Palestinian terrorist group was initially suspected
in the bombing that killed 259 people in the air and 11 on the
ground in the small Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from defense council Bill Taylor, Ferrie told
the three High Court judges that the line of inquiry against the
Palestinians was dropped when evidence began pointing to Libyan
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Alan Turnbull showed the court pictures of flattened
houses surrounded by debris, a bombed out crater drenched with jet
fuel, and the Boeing 747's nose cone, the aircraft name ''Maid of
the Seas'' legible on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination Ferrie was asked to confirm that
suspicion fell initially on the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a Damascus-based group.
</P>
<P>
   The PFLP-GC, led by Ahmed Jibril, was responsible for previous
air terrorism with similarities to Lockerbie. One of the men held
responsible for a bomb on an El Al airliner in 1972 fell under
suspicion again early in the Pan Am case, said Taylor, the defense
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Pan Am bombing, Jibril denied involvement by
his group. That denial was repeated in Damascus Thursday by a
PFLP-GC official on condition of not being named.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrie said the El Al explosive was triggered by a barometric
device, an apparent trademark of the Palestinian groups. The
prosecution has said that a timing device was used to detonate the
Pan Am bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''There came a state when the inquiry led the police officers in
a direction other than the PFLP-GC, didn't they?'' the prosecutor
asked Ferrie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes sir,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   In separate testimony, police officer Stephen Comerford
confirmed that a ''Joint Intelligence Group'' involving the CIA,
the FBI and intelligence agencies of other countries gathered
evidence at the disaster site.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Comerford confirmed that the group was
''concerned about sensitive information,'' notably documents found
in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   But on re-examination, Comerford denied knowledge of evidence
taken from the scene before Scottish police could get their hands
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trial of Pan Am flight 103 really started this morning,''
said Bert Ammerman, whose brother Thomas was killed. The defense
team ''started their tactic of the smoking gun ... to get people to
think about the PFLP-GC and CIA,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Candidates End Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Challenger Alejandro Toledo said Friday he has
broken off talks with President Alberto Fujimori's party, alleging
his opponents weren't interested in ensuring a fair May 28 runoff
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were cut off because ''we were able to confirm that there
was no political will whatsoever to improve the conditions,''
Toledo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Tudela, Fujimori's vice-presidential candidate and a
member of the negotiating team, angrily accused Toledo's camp of
bargaining in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Talks came to an abrupt halt late Thursday after three days of
closed-door negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Tudela said he hoped the dialogue could resume, and neither side
ruled out holding a debate between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A key sticking point was access to Peru's mostly pro-government
television networks, which Toledo says have smeared him and denied
him coverage.
</P>
<P>
   He said none of the major networks, including the state-run
station, covered his opening second-round rally. The event drew
tens of thousands of supporters Wednesday night in the southern
Andean city of Arequipa.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has denied allegations that fraud played a part in the
April 9 first round vote. He has downplayed the significance of
widespread irregularities that he says had no affect the results.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo warned Fujimori's government would lack legitimacy if he
won an unprecedented third five-year term without correcting
electoral abuses. That would destabilize the nation, frighten away
foreign investment and deepen poverty, Toledo said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Bush 'President Bush'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to help Al Gore, President Clinton
inadvertently promoted the wrong man Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked about a videotape that portrayed the National
Rifle Association as hankering to operate out of a potential Bush
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that they think that (NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne) LaPierre will literally have an office here if
President Bush -- I mean, if Governor Bush -- gets elected,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He made two more quick references to Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the GOP presidential candidate, to try to clear things up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe that it's clear from the record of Governor Bush
in Texas ... that whatever is done on this issue will only be done
with their approval,'' Clinton said. ''I can believe that without
thinking anything bad about Mr. LaPierre or about Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been asked about a TV ad by Handgun Control Inc.
that showed the NRA's first vice president, Kayne Robinson, saying,
''If we win we'll have a president ... where we work out of their
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were trying to keep that a secret until after
the election,'' Clinton joked.

<HEADLINE> Crude, Copper Rise; Soybeans Fall  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil prices bolted higher Friday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, propelled by rising concerns about dwindling gasoline
supplies as summer nears.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline futures also ended the week sharply higher, although
end-of-the-week profit-taking resulted in a slight one-day decline.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, copper futures rose sharply and
soybeans sank.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in crude was underpinned by concerns that a strike by
private-sector workers in Norway will hamper oil output and
significantly shrink exports from a leading world producer.
</P>
<P>
   But market-watchers said the major impetus was continuing fear
that gasoline refiners won't be able to meet demand as motorists
take to the roads for summer vacation in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are worried about extremely tight supplies going into
the driving season,'' said Phil Flynn, senior energy market analyst
for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real story this week has been the gasoline market. Tight
supplies are really driving the market. The most impressive thing
today was it didn't sell off harder after the dramatic runup it's
had,'' he said, referring to a surge highlighted by a 6 percent
price increase on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Light sweet crude for June delivery rose 31 cents to $27.29 a
barrel; June unleaded gasoline fell .53 cent to 90.35 cents a
gallon; June heating oil fell .89 cent to 67.31 cents a gallon;
June natural gas fell 8.2 cents to $3.025 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose 14 cents to
$25.29 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On the Comex division of the New York Merc, concern over
dwindling world copper supplies ignited a technical rally that sent
copper to a 10-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Government data showing U.S. unemployment falling to a 30-year
low underpinned the surge, as a vibrant economy means continued
strong demand for copper materials used in the construction
industry. Analysts also said buyers saw copper's lagging price as a
good buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   July copper settled up 2.10 cents at 84.05 cents a pound after
reaching as high as 84.30 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who had pumped up soybean prices on concerns about
looming drought effects went on a selling spree after
meteorologists called for as much as an inch of rain to fall on a
wide area of the Midwest starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An Iowa climate expert said that while chances for a summer
drought are higher than 50 percent, subsoil moisture is adequate.
Still, the forecasts for potentially soggy weather over the next

<HEADLINE> Team Returns Without Seeing US Vets  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Koreans investigating an alleged mass
killing of civilians during the Korean War returned home Friday
without seeing the U.S. veterans who have firsthand information
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation Friday morning ended a three-day visit that
included meetings with U.S. Army officials also probing alleged
killings by American soldiers in July 1950 at the village of No Gun
Ri.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were held so the two sides could talk about
progress of their investigations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to the National Archives in a Washington suburb,
staff explained to the Koreans the process Army investigators are
using to review related government documents.
</P>
<P>
   But the group, led by retired Korean Gen. Paik Sun-yup, did not
have interviews it wanted with U.S. veterans who said they'd been
involved at No Gun Ri. The South Koreans say they had asked the
U.S. government to arrange interviews with American veterans who
has served at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides confirmed Friday that interviews never took place.
</P>
<P>
   Koreans declined to comment on the reason. And Army spokesman
Maj. Thomas Collins said they were never requested.
</P>
<P>
   ''To our knowledge, we have not received any requests for the
Koreans to do any interviews of witnesses'' during this trip, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said earlier in the week that they were
studying whether there might be legal problems involved if the
Koreans were to directly interview the vets and that, instead, they
might be given transcripts of any interviews the United States does
with the vets.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting dozens of American veterans and South Korean survivors,
The Associated Press reported in September that retreating U.S.
troops machine-gunned hundreds of unarmed civilians cowering in a
tunnel at No Gun Ri in central South Korea in the early weeks of
the Korean conflict.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean survivors claim that about 400 people were killed
at the tunnel and a preceding air raid by American jets.
</P>
<P>
   The claim was ignored under past South Korean military
governments. After the AP report, the two governments announced
they would each investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army has said it hopes to complete its probe by June,
when Seoul and Washington plan special ceremonies to mark the 50th
anniversary of the start of the Korean War on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly how much of the work is done. Deputy
Defense Secretary Rudy de Leon said Monday that not all possible
witnesses have been interviewed by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically if anyone who fired on the Koreans had been
interviewed, he said only, ''We still have witnesses to interview
that we have not interviewed.''

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Falls to 3.9 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The supercharged U.S. economy pushed the
unemployment rate to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent last month.
Blacks and Hispanics recorded their lowest jobless rates in
history.
</P>
<P>
   While economists worried that the Federal Reserve will be forced
to move more aggressively to slow things down and keep inflation at
bay, the Clinton administration pointed to Friday's unemployment
report as further evidence of the economy's remarkable strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most Americans have never lived in a peacetime economy with
unemployment as low as it is today,'' President Clinton told
reporters at the White House. ''This is a happy day for the people
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Good news for workers, and for politicians hoping voters will
give them credit, the Labor Department's employment report was
troubling to economists who feared it underscores that the Fed
still has a lot of work to do to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates five times since last June, in
small quarter-point increments. A growing number of economists
predict a more aggressive half-point move when the Fed next meets
May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street investors, who normally worry about inflation and
interest rates when they see strong economic reports, shrugged off
the new jobless figures. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
165.37 points to close at 10,577.86 and the Nasdaq gained 96.58
points to finish at 3,816.82.
</P>
<P>
   April's stronger-than-expected job growth of 340,000 followed an
even bigger 458,000 increase in workers in March, figures that
analysts said are too strong for the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan
Greenspan, increasingly worried that a dwindling pool of available
workers will spark rising wage pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''All is right for workers, but all is not right for Alan
Greenspan,'' said Paul Kasriel, chief economist with Northern Trust
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn is among those predicting a
half-point rate increase in May. ''The logic is that this increment
gradualism has not worked. The economy and the stock market have
put on a Teflon coating,'' he said. Sohn believes the Fed might
even opt for a three-quarter-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Strong job creation in April, aided by a big burst of hiring for
the 2000 Census, helped pull the unemployment rate down from
March's rate of 4.1 percent, a bigger drop than many analysts were
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the nation's jobless rate stood at 3.9 percent was
in January 1970, during the Vietnam War. Clinton said the
unemployment rate has not been this low in peacetime since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate for blacks fell to an all-time monthly low
of 7.2 percent in April from the previous low of 7.3 percent in
March. The rate for Hispanics dropped to a record low 5.4 percent,
surpassing the previous low of 5.6 percent set in January.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation
pressure, grew by 0.4 percent to $13.64 in April. That was twice as
fast as many analysts anticipated. For the year ending April 30,
wages rose 3.8 percent, the biggest year-over-year leap since July.
In March, average hourly earnings went up 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Heightened wage pressures now look like the rule rather than
the exception,'' First Union economist Mark Vitner said.
</P>
<P>
   While strong job and wage growth is good for workers, economists
and members of the Fed worry that the combination might worsen
inflation. They fear that employers scrambling to find scarce
workers will recruit them with big boosts in wages and benefits,
increased costs that could be passed to consumers in higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of 73,000 temporary census workers helped boost
overall payrolls in April. Excluding this hiring, employment would
have grown by a more modest but still robust 267,000, government
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the
United States, led the way in job growth last month, adding 380,000
workers. Retailers added 119,000 jobs, mostly at bars and
restaurants. Business services, a category that includes a wide
range of activities, added 121,000 jobs. Employment at hotels and
other lodging places grew considerably for a second straight month.
</P>
<P>
   Even manufacturing, which lost around 248,000 jobs last year,
created 11,000 jobs in April. Construction companies shed 55,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Americans rang up a less-than-expected but still
sizable $9.1 billion in consumer debt in March, the smallest
increase in five months, the Federal Reserve said.

<HEADLINE> Conseco Sells $1.5B in Loans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Ind. (AP) -- Conseco Inc. took steps to shore up its
finances Friday by agreeing to sell $1.5 billion in consumer loans
to Lehman Brothers Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmel-based financial services company, whose chairman and
chief financial officer resigned under pressure last week, said it
would use up to $500 million of the proceeds to repay debt owed by
its consumer lending subsidiary, Conseco Finance, to the parent
company.
</P>
<P>
   David V. Harkins, Conseco's interim chairman and chief
executive, issued a statement saying the deal provided
''significant liquidity'' for both Conseco and Conseco Finance,
which was put up for sale in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that these arrangements will provide the company
with the necessary liquidity to pursue its previously announced
strategy of selling Conseco Finance and refocusing on its core
insurance operations,'' Harkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Ira Zuckerman of Nutmeg Securities in Westport,
Conn., said using the sale to clear debt will relieve some of the
financial pressure on Conseco Finance to continue operating as a
lender while the parent company shops it around.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to relieve some pressure on the bottom line,''
Zuckerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco Finance consists large of the former Green Tree
Financial Corp., which Conseco acquired for $6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco stock was trading above $58 a share before the Green
Tree acquisition, but has since fallen sharply. Its shares fell 6\
cents to $5.18} in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Juror Kicked Off Edwards Case  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The juror dismissed from former Gov.
Edwin Edwards' federal racketeering trial was let go after
deliberations started not because of bias, the judge said Friday,
but because he couldn't follow court rules.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola said the juror, known only as
No. 68, had been investigated twice during the proceedings before
finally being let go Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the first full day of deliberations in the
four-month trial since Monday, when they were stalled while
Polozola decided whether No. 68 should stay. Polozola said the loss
of one of the 12 jurors whould not hinder deliberations. The jury
got the case April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son Stephen, state Sen. Greg Tarver and four others
are accused of a series of extortion schemes to manipulate the
licensing of Louisiana riverboat casinos from 1991 through 1997,
before and after Edwards' fourth and final term in office. Edwards,
72, could be sentenced to more than 300 years in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Polozola revealed Friday that No. 68, a 40-year-old man from
East Baton Rouge Parish, had been the focus of two investigations
following phone calls from outside sources before deliberations
began.
</P>
<P>
   But federal marshals found no reason for dismissal until last
week, when the court learned that No. 68 brought a dictionary and a
thesaurus to the deliberation room in violation of court rules. The
word ''extortion'' had been highlighted before federal marshals
removed the books from the room.
</P>
<P>
   No. 68 is Pentecostal and there had been reports that he may
have been refusing to participate in deliberations because his
religion prevented him from sitting in judgment of others.
</P>
<P>
   But Polozola said Friday that during his interviews with jurors
this week, he did not ask about their religious beliefs or where
they stood in their evaluation of the evidence.

<HEADLINE> Brazel Gets Tough on Farmworkers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Facing a possible showdown with army
troops on Friday, thousands of farmers angered at the slow pace of
land reform began leaving government buildings they had occupied
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The government threatened to send in the army to evict landless
farmers who took over the buildings in eight states and Brasilia,
the capital, on Tuesday in the latest wave of protests aimed at
speeding up land reform.
</P>
<P>
   If police were unable to oust the protesters, army troops would
be used, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although many occupations were peaceful, police in some cities
used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up demonstrations and
arrested hundreds of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations were spearheaded by the Landless Rural Workers
Movement, known here as MST, which organizes the invasion of idle
farm land to pressure the government to accelerate agrarian reform.
</P>
<P>
   The government also announced a series of measures aimed at
dissuading the MST from occupying land in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The principal measure stipulates a two-year delay in the
expropriation and distribution of illegally occupied land.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure, which the government hopes will appease the
MST, allows state governments to use rural land tax funds to
expropriate and distribute land.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Japan Prime Minister Meet  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trade dispute hovering in the background,
President Clinton met with new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
on Friday and tried to convince him that an open approach to
technology could foster jobs and wealth in Japan as it has in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Mori, who became prime minister a month ago after
Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke, met for an hour and 15 minutes in
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders dealt ''in a broad, philosophical aspect'' with
U.S. complaints that Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. charges exorbitant connection rates,
according to a White House official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants connection rates reduced by 41 percent.
Japan has offered to cut them by 22.5 percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who participated
in Friday's meeting, has said the United States will decide by the
end of July whether to bring a case against Japan before the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That timetable would allow Clinton to press Mori again on the
issue during a Group of Eight economic summit scheduled for July in
the town of Nago on Okinawa before actually filing a complaint with
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in recent visits by world leaders, Clinton strolled
across the White House Rose Garden with Mori, who smiled but did
not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also discussed Mori's recent meeting with
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Clinton's effort to secure
normal trade relations with China, the White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed hope that Japan would continue to rebuild
rapidly, relying on the ''inherent strengths'' of a highly skilled,
educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's getting better,'' Clinton said of Japan's
economy. ''I believe that they will return to big growth, I hope
sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori brought with him a baseball that Clinton signed and sent to
him in 1993, when Mori was trade minister. Since that time, Mori
has become a football fan, so Clinton gave him a football and a few
golf balls bearing the White House emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will attend the G-8 summit, becoming the first U.S.
president to visit Okinawa since America relinquished the island's
postwar administration to Japan in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military bases on Okinawa are a source of friction for
residents, who have been angry at the American presence there since
two Marines and a sailor raped a local schoolgirl in 1995. A small
island about 1,000 miles from Tokyo, Okinawa houses about
two-thirds of the more than 50,000 U.S. military personnel
stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would consult with Mori on how best to reach out
to Okinawans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I'll have a chance to speak with them,'' Clinton said.
''We tried to be sensitive to the concerns of the people and be
highly respectful. Where mistakes have been made we've tried to
correct them and we'll continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's meeting was the final stop of an extended foreign trip
for Mori that began April 27 in St. Petersburg, Russia.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Hostage-Taker Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A three-hour hostage drama that emptied a
10-story medical building Friday ended when a man surrendered after
holding what turned out to be a BB gun at his estranged wife and
her co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Donald T. Ross, 29, of Concord, was charged with second-degree
kidnapping and assault by pointing a gun after turning himself over
to police. Ross' wife, Sandy, also 29, was unharmed, and no shots
were fired.
</P>
<P>
   The couple separated about a week ago, police said, and Ross
told negotiators that he was upset over their marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ross released his one other hostage -- a woman who suffered an
asthma attack -- after being held captive more than an hour, said
Maj. Tim Stewart, who headed the police SWAT team at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in fatigues, black cap and a black T-shirt with the
professional wrestling slogan ''Layeth the Smacketh Down,'' Ross
was hustled out of the Metroview Professional Building before noon.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began when Ross, armed with a BB gun with a silencer
made from a Coca-Cola bottle and carrying a briefcase containing
several knives, duct tape and twine, entered the building's ninth
floor about 8:30 a.m., just before the office opened.
</P>
<P>
   Ross pointed a gun at several clinic employees, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police cars soon converged on the scene and about 250
to 300 workers were evacuated from other floors.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators made contact by phone with Ross shortly after
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a little tense with us, but he was willing to listen
and he expressed himself very well,'' said police Sgt. Glen
Gigante.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point was when Ross agreed to release the asthmatic
hostage, Gigante said.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees on the ninth floor who were unable to slip away
hid under desks during the entire incident, Stewart said. ''I don't
think that he knew the people were in there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> WPP Resumes Young &AMP; Rubicam Talks  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Britain's WPP Group PLC is back in the hunt for
advertising agency Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., resuming discussions that
have broken down twice on a deal that would make WPP the world's
biggest ad and marketing company.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure Friday sent Y&AMP;R shares up 9 percent on the New
York Stock Exchange, where they gained $4.50 to $54.12{ in
afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R, a 77-year-old agency that went public only two years ago,
counts AT&AMP;T Corp., Ford Motor Co., Sears, Roebuck and Co. and
Colgate-Palmolive Co. among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   WPP announced the resumption of talks that had been terminated a
week ago in a brief statement, adding ''there can be no assurances
that a transaction will be agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   The London-based owner of the J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather advertising agencies has been in intermittent talks since
January with New York-based Young &AMP; Rubicam.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks broke down in mid-March, resumed in April and broke
down again last week over what sources said were disagreements over
price, how Y&AMP;R would operate and contracts for top Y&AMP;R executives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the French advertising company Publicis SA authorized
its top management to explore the possibility of an agreement to
combine with Y&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks are continuing, sources familiar with the
discussions said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that WPP chief executive Martin
Sorrell remained intent on acquiring Y&AMP;R despite the breakdown of
talks on a friendly deal. He transformed a shell company into a
world ad powerhouse in the 1980s with hostile takeovers of the
venerable Thompson and Ogilvy agencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Y&AMP;R's talks with Publicis were seen as an
effort to pressure WPP to raise its offer and sweeten other terms
of its proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to WPP for additional comment Friday were not returned.
Y&AMP;R and Publicis each declined comment on the latest development.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest advertising companies have been scrambling to expand
their reach around the world and to diversify their services beyond
creating and placing print and broadcast ads because multinational
clients are demanding more versatility in reaching customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry is undergoing aggressive consolidation,'' Karen
Ficker, an analyst who follows it for ING Barings in New York, said
recently. ''There is a feeling you need to be one of the top
players to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   WPP is the third-biggest ad organization in the world based on
1999 revenue of about $4.82 billion, according to the trade
publication Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R ranked seventh on that list with about $1.87 billion in
revenue while Publicis was 10th at $1.43 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of WPP and Y&AMP;R would have allow WPP to vault past
the two bigger ad companies on the Ad Age list -- Omnicom Group at
$5.74 billion in revenue and Interpublic Group of Companies at
$5.08 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A Y&AMP;R merger with Publicis would create the fourth biggest ad
company behind WPP.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Euro; Up Vs. Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the euro and
several other currencies Friday despite strong U.S. economic data.
But it rose against the Japanese yen and British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In New York trading, the euro was quoted at 89.79 cents, up from
a late rate of 88.99 cents on Thursday, when it sank to an all-time
low of 88.45 cents during trading.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also fell to 1.7307 Swiss francs from 1.7387 and to
1.4913 Canadian dollars from 1.4976 late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. currency rose to 108.34 Japanese yen from 108.20
yen late Thursday and gained ground against sterling, which fell to
$1.5274 from $1.5418.
</P>
<P>
   Currency analysts said traders largely shrugged off a new
economic report that raised the probability of a U.S. interest rate
increase when the Federal Reserve meets May 16. Traders instead
adjusted their holdings in advance of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you have come as far as we have seen against the euro,
there is a partial retracement on Friday,'' said Greg Anderson,
financial economist on the currency desk at Fleet Bank in Boston.
''I'm surprised the backup is as small as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro sank to new lows earlier in the week in what traders
said reflected a lack of confidence in the ability of European
authorities to take meaningful action to stimulate the economy and
make investment there attractive. The euro is the single currency
of 11 European nations and has been trading since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The long-term trend is that the euro is going to weaken as far
out as you can see until something changes,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Department report Friday that the U.S. unemployment rate
fell to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent last month amid
stronger-than-expected job growth of 340,000 fanned speculation
that the Fed will raise rates by as much as one-half percentage
point to curb growth and head off a resurgence of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the inflation concerns was a 0.4 percent rise in
average hourly earnings in April. That was twice as fast as many
analysts anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   While an increase in U.S. interest rates would normally boost
the dollar, Anderson said currency traders are also starting to
worry that a large rate hike could lead to a dramatic economic
slowdown which could discourage investment here and hurt the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's in the back of the market's mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1790 German
marks, down from 2.1965; 7.3079 French francs, down from 7.3666;
and 2,157.16 Italian lire, up from 2,174.49.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force said Friday it will give new

repaying their loans.
</P>
<P>
   The offer -- for recruits who sign up for four- or six-year
enlistments -- is the latest in a series of incentives the Air Force

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slumped again Friday, ending a full
week of losses, as a series of strong economic reports heightened
fears that the Fed may move aggressively in raising interest
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 9/16
point, or $5.63 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in
the opposite direction, rose to 6.50 percent compared with 6.42
percent late Thursday. The benchmark yield had ended at 5.96
percent a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32 point to yield 6.18
percent, up from 6.15 percent a day earlier, according to Bridge
Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly strong April employment report released Friday
was the latest economic indicator to show strengthening in the U.S.
economy, leading market watchers to expect a rate hike of half a
percentage point at the next Fed meeting May 16. The Fed already
has raised rates by one-quarter point five times since June 1999 in
a bid to cool off the economy and hold down inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.9 percent unemployment rate in April was the lowest in 30
years, while average hourly wages rose more than analysts had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   A tight labor market can add to inflation by forcing wages
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and higher inflation both hurt investments
with fixed returns, such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Friday, short-term Treasury securities fell [
point to 3/16 point, while intermediate maturities fell between
5/16 point and ] point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.95 percent as the
discount rose 0.06 percentage point from Thursday to 5.79 percent.
Six-month yields were 6.28 percent, as the discount rose 0.09
percentage point to 6.02 percent. One-year yields were 6.24 percent
as the discount rose by 0.10 percentage point to 5.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell to 5.94 percent from 6.06 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 5/16 to 92 13/16. The average yield to
maturity rose to 6.16 percent from 6.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Feinstein Top Veep List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Dianne Feinstein were
mentioned most frequently when Democrats were asked whom they want
to see as vice president, says an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former New Jersey senator and presidential candidate,
and Feinstein, a California senator, remained at the top of the
list when independents were included in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was named by one-third of the Democrats and Feinstein
was named by one-fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible candidates were in single digits, including
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and former Maine
Sen. George Mitchell, all at 6 percent, and Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson at 4 percent. Their totals were about the same with
independents included.
</P>
<P>
   In NBC-Journal poll results released Wednesday, Bush led Gore in
the presidential race, 46 percent to 41 percent. Bush maintains a
slight edge when other candidates are included.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,003 registered voters taken April 29 through
Monday had an error margin of 3 percentage points, larger for
subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Parisians for Millennium Concert  </HEADLINE>
By JASON STRAZIUSO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- After ushering in the millennium with a sparkling
feast for the eyes, the Eiffel Tower continued the party Friday
with a treat for the ears -- an extravaganza concert of classical
favorites with Seiji Ozawa conducting the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Parisians spread over the Champs de Mars,
lounging on picnic blankets, sipping wine and watching the
musicians on stage under the famed tower, gently lit for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expected 100,000 Parisians to show up for the
concert, which city officials billed as the first free classical
concert ever presented at the base of the Iron Lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't have imagined that so many people would have
shown up for this kind of concert,'' said Christian Gillet, a
Parisian who came straight from work, dressed in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-born Ozawa, 64, conducted his orchestra and the
Orchestre de Paris along with a chorus of 600 children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, widely regarded as the centerpiece of the city's
millennium celebrations, cost more than $2 million for an
8,000-square-foot stage and a special proscenium arch upon which
skylines of Paris and Boston were projected along with images
evoking the grandeur of opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected something more simple, but even the backstage is
paradise,'' Ozawa said. ''We could have a party.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli joined the orchestras, performing
arias from Puccini's Tosca, Verdi's Rigoletto, and the beloved
French children's melody ''Frere Jacques.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute concert was to be topped off with the finale of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the ''Ode to Joy.'' As the orchestra
played the last note, a heavy downpour began, soaking concertgoers.
</P>
<P>
   The concert marks the last foreign tour for Ozawa and the Boston
Symphony before he resigns as music director to take up a new post
in 2002 with the Vienna Opera.

intern can testify that she never gave Tripp permission to tape-record their

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The District of Columbia's interim fire chief
announced his resignation Friday in a dispute over staffing cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas N. Tippett left his job this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Mayor Anthony A. Williams, Tippett stated that
the deputy mayor told him he had to start staffing ladder trucks

   A departmental statement noted that the city's Financial Control

   Tippett added the fifth ladder position after reports were

<HEADLINE> NY OKs Non-Prescription Needle Buys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New Yorkers will soon be able to buy
hypodermic needles without a prescription, a move aimed at
inhibiting the spread of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to save tens of thousands of lives by virtually
eliminating needle sharing,'' said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, a
Manhattan Democrat. ''It's a tragedy we weren't able to do this a
decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   New York will become the 42nd state to allow the practice when
the law takes effect Jan. 1. The measure, included in the budget
package signed into law Thursday and Friday, applies to those 18
and older.
</P>
<P>
   The law drew criticism from Assemblyman Robert Straniere, a
Republican from Staten Island, who referred to it as a ''quantum
leap forward for the legalization of drugs in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Algaze, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc.,
a New York-City based AIDS organization, applauded the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Algaze said there have been 139,063 cases of AIDS reported in
New York state, with 84,065 deaths. More than half of current cases
were caused by the sharing of HIV-contaminated syringes or sexual
contact with a person who was infected through sharing needles.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that a pamphlet be included with needles on the
proper use and disposal of syringes and the dangers of drug use and
needle sharing. It will also have an HIV hotline number.

<HEADLINE> WTO To Canada: Extend Patents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- World Trade Organization experts on Friday ruled
that parts of Canada's patents law are illegal because they fail to
protect inventors for a sufficient period.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, established at the request of the United States, said
Canada had signed an agreement in 1996 guaranteeing that patents
would last for at least 20 years from the date of filing.
</P>
<P>
   But Canada's legislation gave patents filed before October 1989
protection for only 17 years from the date they were approved,
because they came under a different law.
</P>
<P>
   Canada told the panel that the average period of time between
application and granting of a patent was five years, so in practice
inventions patented before 1989 enjoyed at least 20 years'
protection.
</P>
<P>
   However, the WTO panel said it could not take into account
informal delays and ordered Canada to change its laws to meet WTO
rules. Canada has 60 days to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said the United States welcomed the WTO panel ruling and hoped
Canada would comply quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a complex dispute,'' Barshefsky said in a
statement. ''This decision requires Canada to provide 20 years of
patent protection to more than 160,000 patented products, which
span the full spectrum of industries. We expect Canada to do the
right thing and comply with its WTO obligations.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 165; Nasdaq Is Up 96  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Renewed enthusiam for technology issues
propelled the stock market higher Friday, helping investors
overlook the latest evidence that the economy is growing too fast
for the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 165.37 to close at
10,577.86 and the Nasdaq composite index gained 96.58 to close at
3,816.82.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the solid rally, both the Dow and the Nasdaq finished
the week with losses, failing to recover completely from big losses
on Wednesday. The Dow, which tumbled 250 points on Wednesday, ended
the week 156.05 points lower while the Nasdaq lost 43.84 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators rose Friday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 23.06 to 1,432.63 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 10.93 to 512.84.
</P>
<P>
   The rally surprised analysts who expected the market to fall in
the wake of an exceptionally strong employment report, which raised
expectations of a big increase in interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate fell in
April to a three-decade low of 3.9 percent. Most analysts had
expected a 4.0 reading.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 percent in April to $13.64, twice as fast as many analysts
were predicting. Economists believe that rising wage pressures
provide the strongest impetus for the Federal Reserve to continue
raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report strengthened the case for a half-percentage
point increase at the Fed's May 16 meeting. The Fed has raised
rates five times since last June, but all have been modest,
quarter-point increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some consensus in the stock market that the Fed will
raise interest rates a half-point in May and the market is prepared
for that,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. But he said Friday's strong report raised questions about
whether the Fed will follow up with another big increase in June.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, seemed to brush off concerns about higher
interest rates and continued to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already seen a lot of damage in this market. We had a
vicious shakeout about a month ago,'' said Larry Wachtel, market
analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Now, they can throw bad news at
us and we won't react as badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher as investors poured money
into the sector, believing rapid growth will equip those companies
to best handle a spate of interest rate increases. Applied
Materials rose 4[ to 101~ and JDS Uniphase rose 2 5/16 to 93 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Computer networking provider Cisco Systems was the most active
Nasdaq stock, rising 4[ to 67} after it agreed to acquire
Arrowpoint Communications in a stock swap valued at $5.7 billion.
Arrowpoint rose 5] to 140 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the strongest Dow component, rising 4| to
136}..
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 2 15/16 to 156 15/16 in advance of a
3-for-1 stock split due to take effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet retailers rose after Lehman Brothers initiated
coverage of the sector. Amazon.com rose 3 7/16 to 58{.
</P>
<P>
   ''The larger companies with established brands and critical mass
should continue to evolve into world-class commerce platforms with
highly profitable business models,'' Lehman analyst Holly Becker
told clients.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was extremely low, leaving some analysts worried that the
investors who bid stocks higher on Friday lacked conviction.
Analysts said some traders opted to head to the sidelines this past
week while the market digested the latest slate of economic news.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, composite volume totaled 964.65
million shares, compared with 1.10 billion in the previous session.
The Nasdaq Stock Market had its quietest day of the year, with
roughly 1.17 billion shares changing hands as of 4 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Blair Vows To End N.Ireland Impasse  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The prime ministers of Britain
and Ireland announced an ambitious plan Friday for restoring power
to Northern Ireland's suspended Catholic-Protestant administration
by May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking shortly before midnight following more than 30 hours of
negotiations with local parties, Bertie Ahern of Ireland and Tony
Blair of Britain said all sides had agreed to set the ''target
date'' for resuming power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two governments have put proposals to the parties, and
subject to a positive response, it will be the intention of the
governments to reinstate the institutions on the 22nd of May,''
Blair said at Hillsborough Castle, the negotiating venue southwest
of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   May 22 is the second anniversary of the overwhelming
ratification of the Good Friday peace accord in public referendums.
The historic pact also made the date the deadline for Northern
Ireland's rival paramilitary groups to disarm, an unfulfilled goal
that has repeatedly stymied wider political progress.
</P>
<P>
   A four-party coalition involving the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party
took office in Northern Ireland in December, but Britain suspended
the administration's powers in February after the Irish Republican
Army refused to begin disarming as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And both Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern emphasized
that they couldn't force Protestant politicians to resume sharing
power with Sinn Fein. Therefore, they said, a positive response
soon from the outlawed IRA would be essential for the four-party
administration to regain its authority by May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now incumbent upon the parties, and perhaps in particular
the paramilitary organizations, to give their response to the
proposals we've made,'' Blair said, Ahern standing at his side. ''I
very much hope that that response is positive, and in particular
that we can make sure that the arms issue is dealt with completely
and verifiably.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Athlete Kills Himself  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A Columbine High basketball star who
witnessed last year's bloodbath -- losing one of his best friends --
hanged himself in his garage as a CD, set to replay continuously,
blared a song with the words: ''I'm too depressed to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second suicide among friends or relatives of the
Columbine High victims, shocking the community two weeks after the
first anniversary of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Barnes, a 17-year-old who averaged 26.2 points a game as a
junior last season and had attracted attention from Harvard, Notre
Dame and other universities, used an electrical cord to hang
himself Thursday morning, according to teammate Dave Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adam's Song,'' by the group Blink 182, was playing when his
parents found the body, Mitchell said. The lyrics include the
phrases ''I never thought I'd die alone'' and ''I'm too depressed
to go on. You'll be sorry when I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends were mystified, saying there were no signs of turmoil in
the teen-ager's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to him the night before, and it didn't seem like
anything was wrong,'' Mitchell said. ''We talked about the usual
stuff, girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Grief counselors cautioned against automatically linking Barnes'
death to the Columbine shootings, noting that teen-agers live in a
pressure-cooker world. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death
for people ages 15 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't believe it. It was horrible. It made me mad. Mad
at Greg,'' said Brian Deidel, a teammate and childhood friend. ''He
had so much going for him. He didn't need to do that to everybody
who knows him, who loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would not say whether Barnes left a note and gave
no additional details.
</P>
<P>
   The news was devastating for students and staff at Columbine.
Six counselors were at the school to offer help, and substitute
teachers were on call to fill in for staff members who wanted to
stay home. Many students skipped school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a somber mood at Columbine High School,'' school district
spokesman Rick Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, 1999, two teen-age boys killed 12 fellow Columbine
students and a teacher and wounded 23 people before committing
suicide in the worst school shooting rampage in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was in a science room when the gunmen opened fire. He
told Sports Illustrated he saw teacher Dave Sanders ''take two
shots, right in front of me'' as he watched the rampage through a
window in the door. Barnes was also a good friend of victim Matt
Kechter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Matt always waited by the mailbox for his little brother to
come home from school,'' Barnes told The Associated Press after the
shooting. ''He was the most innocent person I knew.
</P>
<P>
   Since the massacre, the Columbine community has almost
constantly had to live with grief.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Anne Marie Hochhalter, a student who was paralyzed
in the shooting, walked into a pawnshop in October, asked to see a
gun, loaded it and shot herself to death. On Valentine's Day, two
Columbine sweethearts were shot to death in a sandwich shop.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 Barnes scored 31 points in Columbine's loss during
the state quarterfinal playoff game in March. The Denver Post and
the Denver Rocky Mountain News named him to their all-state teams,
and Barnes would have been the top player in the state next year,
according to two coaches whose teams played Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't an extremely athletic kid, but he was a very hard
worker,'' said Kirchers Leday, basketball coach at Denver South
High School. ''He was always a gentleman on the floor. He showed
tremendous leadership, but was always able to keep things
together.''

<HEADLINE> Striking OSU Workers Nix Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Union workers at Ohio State University
rejected a tentative contract Friday, extending a 5-day-old strike
that has closed cafeterias and curtailed campus services.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,900 custodians, food service workers, bus drivers and
other employees represented by the Communications Workers of
America Local 4501 went on strike Monday, mainly for higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative agreement reached early Thursday between the union's
leaders and school administrators was rejected by the union,
845-to-330.
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman Dave Ferguson said there were no immediate
plans to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Managers and nonunion workers have provided enough essential
services on the 48,000-student campus to keep it and its medical
center running.
</P>
<P>
   The rejected proposal included raises of $1 an hour to
groundskeepers, custodial workers and food service employees, and
increases of 50 cents an hour in each of the following two years.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, whose contract expired March 31, want an immediate
$2-an-hour raise.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A man who had feuded with the homeowners
association in a retirement community pleaded innocent Friday to
charges that he barged into the group's meeting last month and shot
two people to death.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Glassel, 61, allegedly entered the Ventana Lakes
Yacht Club on April 19 and began firing. Six people tackled him and
held him until police arrived. Three people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and 30
counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors have not decided whether to
seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Glassel's lawyer, Jeff Zick, did not immediately return a
message seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said they heard Glassel say he wanted to get even with
the homeowners association for the problems it had caused him.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say that among his other complaints, Glassel was
furious at groundskeepers for trimming the shrubs outside his
retirement-community condominium. The association sued Glassel and
obtained a restraining order in 1998 after he shoved a property
manager, said Penny Koepke, an attorney for the association.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said they hadn't seen Glassel in almost two years
until he showed up at the meeting and began firing.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Shares Up on Reynolds Report  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. rose 2.6
percent Friday after a published report said R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc. is considering bidding for the successor to its
former parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group, which owns 80.6 percent of the company that makes
Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies, put itself and its investment in
the snack business up for sale last month after shareholder Carl
Icahn said he was prepared to boost his stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Reynolds Tobacco is
discussing making a bid for Nabisco Group. It cited unidentified
people familiar with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds Tobacco spokeswoman Maura Payne said the company had no
comment on the report. The investment bankers handling the Nabisco
Group sale failed to return phone calls, and Nabisco Group
spokesman Henry Sandbach declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said in March he was prepared to pay $13 a share to boost
his stake in Nabisco Group to about 40 percent from 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group rejected that offer and said it would review all
its options, including selling itself or its controlling stake in
Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food company that also makes Planters
nuts, Life Savers candy and Chips Ahoy cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn then said he was prepared to pay $16 a share for all of
Nabisco Group but later agreed to participate in the bidding
process for the company in exchange for getting a chance to review
its financial books.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco Group
shares rose 43} cents to $17.06\.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group is the successor to RJR Nabisco Holdings, which
spun off Reynolds Tobacco last year as legal challenges mounted to
the cigarette industry. That left it with the controlling interest
in Nabisco Holdings as its only asset.
</P>
<P>
   But Nabisco Group shares have been trading well below the price
that would be implied from owning more than 80 percent of Nabisco
Holdings. In fact, Nabisco Group's total market capitalization has
been less than half of that for Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The lower valuation, analysts say, is because of worries that
those who may win legal judgments against Reynolds Tobacco may go
after the assets of its former parent should Reynolds be unable to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal said Reynolds Tobacco doesn't want to get back into
the food business for the long term. It said Reynolds could buy the
holding company and then sell the stake in the food company and
pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said
in a report Thursday that Reynolds would be the ideal bidder for
Nabisco Group once the food holdings are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said Nabisco Group would be flush with cash after
selling the food stake but its stock would continue to carry the
taint of tobacco ownership. He added that Reynolds would not be
increasing its liability by acquiring Nabisco Group at that point
while other bidders presumably would have to deduct that risk in
making their bids.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible bidders could include other tobacco makers such
as Philip Morris Cos., which also owns Kraft Foods.

<HEADLINE> House Chair Rips State Dept.  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the computers at the State Department
used for classified material are not equipped with passwords and
other security features, a senior U.S. official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the computers as of the ''off-the-shelf'' variety,
the official said he did not know whether a laptop computer
discovered missing in February from the department's Bureau of
Intelligence and Research had the devices.
</P>
<P>
   The department confirmed Friday that two other laptop computers
had disappeared, but only the one that vanished in February is
known to have contained secret information.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the areas
in which computers containing classified information are used are
themselves secure and the computers are not supposed to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that someone got into the secure area
of the bureau who should have not been there. And, he said, it is
the way the area is secured, not what is on the computers, that
provide security.
</P>
<P>
   Entry into secure areas are carefully logged, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure that some computers are not equipped with protective
devices was the latest twist in the State Department's security
situation and tensions between Congress and the department.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee complained
Friday about what he called ''an arrogance'' at the department over
security lapses. The legislator suggested the department call in
experts to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from his
blistering attack in an interview with The Associated Press, Rep.
Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., said, ''There is not sufficient awareness,
or sufficient attention, to security'' at the department.
</P>
<P>
   Goss said the department would be wise to enlist the help of
experts from outside the building in dealing with its security
situation.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the job was
in the competent hands of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. ''It's
comprised not only of special agents who conduct investigation and
provide dignitary protection, but also of very seasoned information
and computer security specialists with many years of experience,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, three laptop computers have been reported missing. Of
the two newly announced computers, one had been signed out to a
senior official, Morton H. Halperin, the assistant secretary of
state for policy planning.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the computers were found to be missing during an
inventory ordered after the unexplained disappearance in February
of a laptop computer containing highly classified information. That
is the only one of the three laptops known to contain classified
material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting other equipment may be missing as well, Boucher said:
''I don't want to mislead anybody into thinking that we're saying
there's only two others -- two unclassified machines missing. We're
still in the middle of this inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright testified Thursday at a closed meeting of the House
Permanent Committee on Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Goss said Friday that Albright was ''appalled'' at the security
situation. ''It is fair to characterize the secretary of state as
being in complete agreement'' that insufficient attention was paid
to classified material.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that she was willing to fix things and go forward is
very good news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But carefully excluding Albright from his criticism, Goss said
''there is an arrogance -- 'We know better, we don't have to do
anything about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, said, ''We expect a full
explanation from administration officials regarding these new
lapses'' at a hearing he called for next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''While these new revelations may not mean that national
security has been further compromised,'' he said, ''it is clear
that the State Department has a long road to travel before its
security standards are even minimally adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Albright, furious about recent security lapses,
delivered a strong plea to department employees for greater
vigilance to protect secret material.
</P>
<P>
   New security measures are likely to be adopted, including
tightened restrictions on where visitors with building passes may
go.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has told principal supervisory personnel to stress the
importance of security to their staffs. In addition, annual
refresher security briefings will be intensified, with mandatory
attendance for all appropriate department employees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the first missing laptop contained large
quantities of documents about arms proliferation issues and highly
sensitive information about sources and methods of U.S.
intelligence collection.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a bugging device was found in a conference room.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Reviews Bracelet Monitoring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy wearing an electronic
monitoring bracelet allegedly broke into a neighbor's home and
raped and killed a teen-age girl, prompting state officials to
review their policy on house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua James Davies had been on house arrest for violating
probation on burglary and theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   His electronic monitor was set to allow him free movement within
150 feet of his home, the standard policy for juveniles, correction
spokeswoman Pam Pattison said. Since the victim's home was within
that circle, the monitor did not alert authorities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials may consider lowering the range to 50 feet because of
Wednesday's assault, Pattison said.
</P>
<P>
   Davies allegedly crawled into the home of the victim, Jessica
Lyons, through a kitchen window and then went into the basement. He
found the 13-year-old girl asleep, raped her and beat her, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's screams woke up her 16-year-old stepsister, Lindsay
Haston, who rushed into the room and was attacked when she
confronted the intruder, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Davies then ran from the house with the father of the
13-year-old in pursuit, triggering the electronic monitoring
bracelet, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica died Thursday from her injuries. The stepsister had to
have surgery to reduce swelling in her brain caused by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was charged with rape, attempted murder and burglary.
Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings was considering upgrading
the charges to murder.

Fedd, a single mother who was four months pregnant. Fedd, 22, was
pushed down a flight of stairs and stabbed when she surprised
Mosley during a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Fedd's daughter, Braizonna Williams, tried to fight off Mosley
and witnessed the killing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She stayed in that house with her mother for 17 hours,
crossing over her mother's body to go the bathroom and crossing
back over it to go back to bed,'' said Fedd's aunt, Kathy
Williamson, 44.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was not in court for Mosley's sentencing. Her maternal
grandmother, Lillie Baker, 42, said Braizonna remains scarred by
what she saw -- afraid to go to the bathroom by herself and
frequently warning Baker to lock the windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who has more than 20 arrests for burglary, drug offenses
and disorderly conduct, said he was looking for drugs and money
when he broke into Fedd's three-story home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry for what happened to your loved one,'' he said,
turning to face Baker in court Friday. ''If I could take it back, I
would. I know it's a horrible thing I've done.''

<HEADLINE> State moves closer to takeover of Camden finances  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Calling Camden's financial records
incomplete, inadequate and in ''flagrant violation'' of state law,
a Superior Court judge Friday allowed the state to go ahead with
its attempt to take control of the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Assignment Judge Francis J. Orlando cited
Camden's inability to file a financial summary statement within 12
months of legal deadlines for more than three years, its consistent
overspending, and inability to attract investors on the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city of Camden is in a precarious financial situation,''
he said. ''This reflects a cavalier disregard for state statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling allows the state Department of Community Affairs to
request a full takeover of the city's finances -- including
contracts, debt refinancing, and purchases. That request is
expected to be made at a state Local Finance Board meeting
scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Camden relies on the state for 70 cents of every dollar in its
$112 million budget, the highest percentage of state aid received
by any big city in the state. The city is New Jersey's poorest, and
among the poorest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Board on April 14 voted to place the city under
supervision, the highest level of oversight without special
legislation. And the state Attorney General's Office filed a
lawsuit April 19 in Superior Court to assume the rarely used
control.
</P>
<P>
   Camden City Attorney John Misci unsuccessfully argued Friday
that the city was not on the brink of financial catastrophe, as the
state had claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police are patrolling, fires are being fought, potholes are
being filled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Misci said many New Jersey cities receive state aid, including
Newark, Jersey City and nearby Cherry Hill. And he argued that
every city has finance problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''These law are not followed to the letter. These laws are
typically waived,'' he said. ''I'm not saying the city's financial
records are 100 percent perfect, but I would say that no
municipality in the state would say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando disagreed, saying that if the city was serious in its
commitment to rejuvenate itself, ''you would be out of the box
showing you have a financial plan in place, rather than playing
catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Ali Sloan-El praised the ruling and called
it the first step in repairing the city's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that there needs to be a hold on what the practice has
been in this administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Council member Israel Nieves also welcomed the decision, but
questioned the motives behind the state's takeover.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to know why Gov. Christie Whitman ''after all
her years in power now wants to take over'' the city's finances.
But he added, ''the people in the city now have the opportunity to
see if the state comes with real solutions or just political
solutions to Camden's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Camden resident Mangaliso Davis, who attended Friday's hearing,
said he was looking forward to a state takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that has to be done,'' he said. ''It's all
about financial integrity and the future of the municipality.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Mayor Milton Milan was named in an indictment charging
him with extortion, money laundering and mail fraud. Authorities
say Milan accepted payoffs and gifts from city contractors and took
bribes from organized crime figures.

<HEADLINE> Buffett To Open Kripsy Kreme Stores  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Singer Jimmy Buffett is adding
doughnuts to his list of favorite junk foods.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach resident -- and former Key Wester -- who crooned
about a ''Cheeseburger in Paradise,'' plans to open several Krispy
Kreme franchises in Palm Beach County later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Krispy Kreme, famous for its sugar-glazed doughnuts,
is about 50 miles to the south in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really has a passion for our product,'' said Stan Parker, a
senior vice president for the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company
whose green-and-white logo with red, scripty double-Ks is a staple
throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett already owns restaurants dubbed Margaritaville in Key
West, Orlando, New Orleans, and Charleston, S.C.. He also mentions
Krispy Kremes in his 1999 tune ''I Will Play for Gumbo.'' He plans
to change the name of his restaurant holding company to KreMaritta.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts Friday to reach Buffet for comment were
unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Two of three carjacking suspects released  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) -- Police arrested three carjacking suspects
Friday after a highway chase and nearly eight-hour manhunt, but
later said the men did not commit that crime.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the suspects were released and a third man, Kimar Dennis,
of Hartford, was charged with taking possession of the stolen car.
Police said they were questioning Dennis, 18, in an attempt to
discover the carjacker's identity. They suspect he obtained the car
from the carjacker, said Hartford Police spokesman Neil Dryfe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the carjacker positively identified but we are
working toward that end,'' Dryfe said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who escaped with cuts and bruises, reported the
carjacking at about 2 a.m., police said. The suspect allegedly
robbed the woman of her jewelry and tried to sexually assault her.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, Hartford police spotted the car going
southbound on Interstate 91 and gave chase. The three men in the
car refused to stop, avoiding spiked boards laid on the roadway to
puncture their tires, police said. When the car crashed into a
guardrail in Middletown, the three fled on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Officers from Hartford, Middletown, Meriden and state police
brought in bloodhounds and went door-to-door near the crash site. A
New York state police helicopter with a heat sensor helped locate
two suspects in a wooded, swampy area in Meriden. The third
surrendered when he was cornered in a nearby scrap yard, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   No shots were fired in the carjacking or arrest, but at least
one of the suspects was believed to be armed. Police did not say if
a gun was found on the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   When the suspects were taken to Hartford police headquarters,
the victim said they were not involved in the carjacking. An
investigation determined the men may not have even known the car
they were driving was stolen, Dryfe said.
</P>
<P>
   Dryfe said additional arrests were expected.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of I-91 between exits 20 and 19 was closed during the
morning search.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows a team effort,'' said Henry Lee, state commissioner
of public safety.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall fixes majority of its fire code violations  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Seton Hall University has corrected most of
the hundreds of fire code violations found on campus following a
deadly dormitory fire, state officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Fire Safety found more than 800 fire code
violations on the South Orange campus in an inspection it conducted
one month after the Jan. 19 dormitory fire that killed three
students and injured 62 others.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that none of the violations was serious
enough to present an immediate danger, but found 35 at Boland Hall,
the site of the fatal fire. Violations ranged from broken exit
signs to the use of extension cords or Christmas lights in dorm
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall has appealed 92 of the violations, most of which
involved paperwork documenting the university's own fire safety
inspections that state officials said were illegible, said William
Cane, director of the state Division of Fire Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The state granted extensions on fixing 23 violations, such as
the university's installation of sprinklers in every dormitory. It
also said the university did not need to correct five of the
violations after learning of other planned improvements, such as
the sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   The university fixed the remainder of the problems, which
included citations for overflowing trash cans left in hallways and
excessive lint in clothes dryers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've done a very good job at correcting their violations,''
said Cane.
</P>
<P>
   The state began inspecting the university's 34 buildings in
February after it took over inspection duties from the South Orange
Fire Department, concluding that the department had done an
inadequate job and had few records documenting inspections over the
past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cane said his office will meet with fire officials in the next
two weeks and may decide to relinquish inspection duties then. The
fire department has certified more fire inspectors since the
takeover, Cane said.
</P>
<P>
   South Orange fire officials referred all comments Friday to
village administrator John Gross, who did not return a telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall received a copy Thursday of the state's fire
inspection report ''that said everything was in order,'' said
university spokeswoman Lisa Grider. The university plans to hire a
compliance officer and has reached out to students in e-mails to
ensure that the violations aren't repeated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall corrected 29 of the 35 fire code violations at Boland
Hall and was cleared of the others, Cane said. The report lists
five of the violations as appeals by the university, but the state
withdrew three of the violations and declared that the other two
had been corrected, Cane said.
</P>
<P>
   The university's plan to install sprinklers in every dormitory
by August cleared it in some cases of violations, said E.J.
Miranda, spokesman for the Division of Fire Safety. For example,
the state said that the university did not need to install stronger
doors to keep smoke and fire out of a stairwell, since the
sprinklers would automatically extinguish a fire.
</P>
<P>
   If the state and Seton Hall do not settle the appealed
violations, they will be referred to the Office of Administrative
Law.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Accused of Misleading Public  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A lawyer challenging the Hearst Corp.'s
purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle accused Hearst on Friday of
misleading the government and the public about the future of the
San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Reilly, a former mayoral candidate, filed an antitrust
lawsuit against Hearst's proposed $660 million deal. Under the
deal, Hearst would take over the Chronicle and give the Examiner,
its 120-year-old paper, to publisher Ted Fang along with a $66
million subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department approved the sale in March and said
Fang's acquisition of the Examiner would restore newspaper
competition in San Francisco for the first time since 1965, when
the Chronicle and Examiner entered a joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   During trial Friday, Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, tried to
show that claims of future competition were an illusion fostered by
Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of San Francisco need to know that there will be no
metropolitan daily newspaper in San Francisco in direct competition
with the Chronicle,'' said Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   He said Fang, whose family-owned company publishes the
free-distribution Independent newspaper, has announced plans to
switch the afternoon Examiner to morning publication but narrow its
focus to San Francisco coverage.
</P>
<P>
   James Asher, Hearst's senior vice president and chief legal
officer, testified the $66 million subsidy over three years was
clearly not enough to support a competitive metropolitan or
regional newspaper. ''I'm not sure there's any amount that would
accomplish that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Hearst never told the Justice Department of
Fang's scaled-back plans, but said the government had questioned
Fang at length and knew of his intentions. And he denied Alioto's
accusations that Hearst misled either the government or the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''You knew there was no chance of this paper being competitive
with the Chronicle,'' Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not know that at all,'' Asher replied.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Backers, Opponents Clash  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez's main rival was
forced to suspend a campaign trip into a poor neighborhood in
Venezuela's capital city after the president's supporters threw
bricks, food and trash.
</P>
<P>
   The clash broke out during a trip by Francisco Arias Cardenas
into a slum on the outskirts of Caracas. Arias was forced to leave
the area after fighting broke out between his supporters and the
president's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, a former military leader who helped Chavez stage a failed
1992 coup attempt, is considered Chavez's main rival. He has
accused the president of abandoning the ideals behind their
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The clash comes a day after a delegation from the Carter Center
issued a report warning of a ''campaign climate of harsh personal
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation called on all candidates to adopt a more
respectful tone and on Venezuela's election authorities to do more
to restore public confidence in the fairness of the upcoming
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The warning comes amid mounting tensions as opposition
candidates, church leaders and retired military leaders have
repeatedly questioned the transparency of the May 28 elections. The
National Election Council was hand-picked by President Hugo
Chavez's political movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high level of uncertainty and distrust generated by the
provisional nature of the legal framework and the method of
appointment of the electoral authorities must be overcome to ensure
full confidence of Venezuelan voters in the electoral process,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans will go to the polls as called for by a new
constitution pushed through last year by Chavez. It requires most
public offices, including the presidency, governorships and the
congress, be ''re-legitimized'' through balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The report came after a week of meetings with candidates,
election officials, and church leaders, said former Uruguayan
President Luis Alberto LaCalle, who heads up the Carter Center
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   LaCalle said the group was encouraged by some recent steps taken
by the election council, including its decision to have an external
audit of the process. The report also called on officials to work
with a committee of civilians to help recover public confidence in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that it is ''was inevitable there will be
some mistakes,'' but that shouldn't be confused with fraud.
''Errors happen in any country's elections from Switzerland to the
United States to Uruguay,'' said LaCalle.
</P>
<P>
   He said the center will send 30 observers to help monitor the
elections, including former President Jimmy Carter.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused in Child Porn Case  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Deputies have arrested a 17-year-old girl for
allegedly distributing child pornography over the Internet from a
computer in her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't think it was actually a 17-year-old girl even though
she was using a 17-year-old girl's screen name,'' said Ralph
Kinney, the sheriff's deputy chief of staff. ''It's very unusual
for females to be involved in the distribution of child
pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputies said they arrested the girl Thursday at her home in
suburban Detroit and seized her computer.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 photographs were discovered stored in the computer,
Sheriff Robert Ficano said Friday. Some of the photographs depicted
bestiality and included boys and girls as young as 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the process of trying to discover where they were
produced,'' Ficano said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, a high school junior, was released to her parents'
custody. She will not be charged until next week so authorities can
complete their investigation, Ficano said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl would meet people in an online chat room called
''Pre-Teen Rape.'' She then gave some people access to her private
file server. Because access was not open to everyone, the girl did
not think she would be caught, Ficano said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl likely will be charged with distributing child
pornography, a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison,
Ficano said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Memorial To Get New Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The name of a Marine who died Monday three
years ago, 30 years after he was injured in the Vietnam War, will
be added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a veterans group said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Cpl. David O. Kamp's name will bring the number
of inscriptions on the memorial to 58,220, Jan Scruggs, president
of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The policy for a new name is that only those who die of a combat
wound suffered in Vietnam be added to the memorial wall. The
Defense Department makes the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp, of Muskegon, Mich., was shot in the neck on December 27,
1967, a wound that left him paralyzed from the neck down. Kamp
surprised doctors and his family by living for nearly 30 years
after his injury. He died on March 29, 1997, of sepsis, a poisoning
of the blood by infection, Scruggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp's name will be officially recognized on May 29 during the
annual Memorial Day observance at the Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated in 1982, the memorial honors the men and women of the
U.S. Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam War and lists the names
of those who died. More than 2.5 million people go to the Wall each
year, making it the most visited memorial in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Students Protest World Bank Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A handful of Michigan State
University students walked out of their graduation ceremonies
Friday amid booing and yelling as World Bank President James
Wolfensohn took to the podium to give the commencement address.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am upset that such an international figure of injustice is
speaking to our university,'' said Crystal Chumley, a 21-year-old
international studies graduate who walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Some students wore pins on their green robes and caps protesting
the bank. Others handed out information about the World Bank before
the ceremony, accusing the bank of perpetuating poverty and
ignoring human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 people also protested outside the Breslin Center --
where the graduation was held -- and at a nearby field. Police
reported no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn, who received an honorary degree during the ceremony,
apologized that his appearance caused the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sorry that my presence here caused problems,'' Wolfensohn
said. ''I am more sorry for you than me because it's your
graduation.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State tightened security for the event after thousands
protested the World Bank last month in Washington. Graduates and
their guests were swept with portable metal detectors and their
bags were checked for weapons.

   LONDON, Ky. (AP) -- A federal judge Friday ordered the Ten
Commandments to be removed from courthouses and classrooms in
several Kentucky counties.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jennifer Coffman ruled that even though the
commandments are surrounded by other historical documents, they are
still religious in nature and serve no secular purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings result from suits filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union on behalf of residents of Pulaski, McCreary and
Harlan counties. They had argued the displays amount to an
unconstitutional mix of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   McCreary County Judge-Executive Jimmie Greene said someone else
will have to remove the Ten Commandments from his courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said early on I would not remove them, and I will not,''
Greene said. ''I'll go to jail before I'll take them down. ... This
is one order I will not obey.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Kentucky's governing bodies in the last year have
voted to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms and courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly passed legislation that would allow the
posting of documents depicting the Ten Commandments in classrooms
and on public property as part of ''an historical display'' along
with other historical documents.

<HEADLINE> 400 Rally in Pittsburgh Vs. Hatred  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- One week after a gunman killed five people in
what police say was a racist hate crime, 400 people of all races
gathered downtown Friday to declare their own intolerance -- for
prejudice and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said they hoped the rally would present a different
picture of the Pittsburgh area than the nation saw with the
shooting last week. Police say another shooting in March was also
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that there is power in numbers and we have
responsibility as individuals and united because violence does
affect all of us,'' said Marcus Flourney, a black University of
Pittsburgh graduate student in social work. ''If one person can be
victimized based on race or gender or whatever, you could too.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say Richard Baumhammers, a 34-year-old sometime
immigration attorney, killed two employees -- one Chinese, one
Vietnamese -- at a Chinese restaurant, an Indian man, a black man
and a Jewish woman.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Chang, a manager at the Chinese restaurant, closed the
business for the day and attended the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're united and we're against racism,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ronald Taylor, who is black, was charged with killing
three white people in a shooting spree in the Pittsburgh suburb of
Wilkinsburg that police said was also racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Tom Murphy asked participants at the rally to think about
their own prejudices, which he said keep many people in Pittsburgh
divided into ethnic enclaves. At one point he asked people to greet
the strangers standing around them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at all the members of our community here that came out of
work,'' said Kishor Pokharna, a man of Indian descent who spoke at
the rally. ''That shows the respect, the community here, the hunger
for peace for everybody. As Mahatma Gandhi said, if you want to
change the world, you've got to be the change.''

<HEADLINE> Congo's Govt. Readies for War  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Congo's government is arming for war but
hoping for peace, a senior government minister said Friday, after a
top U.S. official warned that an upsurge of fighting between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops ''enormously complicated'' plans for a
United Nations observer force.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened reopening of Africa's largest and most
complicated conflagration came during a peace mission by a
seven-member U.N. Security Council delegation led by U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the envoy credited with negotiating
Bosnia's peace.
</P>
<P>
   Congo's war pits the government against numerous rebel and
militia groups in shifting battle fronts scattered across a vast
nation of jungles and savanna nearly the size of Western Europe.
Three African nations -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- support
President Laurent Kabila's forces while Uganda and Rwanda are
backing rebel factions.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Congolese government signed an agreement giving
access and safety assurances to a planned 5,537-member U.N.
observer mission, which would include 3,700 combat troops and 500
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council members met late Friday with military
representatives of Congo's government, Rwanda, Uganda and other
parties to a fragile cease-fire signed last year and again in
April. Plans to hold talks Friday in Congo's capital -- a symbolic
move to improve trust between the enemies -- were aborted earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Congo's foreign minister, Abdoulaye Yerodia, told The Associated
Press during a U.N. flight from Congo's capital of Kinshasa to
Lusaka that his government was ''hoping for peace but preparing
also for war.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuckling, Yerodia added that his government was buying weapons
from the same dealers supplying the rebels. The buildup was
intended to ''perfect our ability to resist invaders.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There can never be lasting peace as long as there are invaders
in our country,'' Yerodia said in a reference to Rwanda and Ugandan
troops. ''The U.N. must bring its peacekeeping mission and pressure
the invaders to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said Ugandan forces sparked the latest hostilities in
Kisangani with an artillery barrage on Rwandan troops. U.N.
observers said five civilians were killed and nine were wounded in
the fighting, which also included small arms fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no way anyone can interpret this action as good
news,'' Holbrooke said, adding: ''Does it directly threaten
dialogue between the two sides? It enormously complicates it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Uganda and Rwanda, which share control of
Kisangani, have been on the rise since last week, when Rwandan
commanders accused their rivals of bringing in 700 soldiers in
violation of a truce that ended another ferocious four-day battle
in the city last August.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a U.N. military officer privately estimated that more
than 100,000 troops would be needed to enforce peace between the
belligerents. A 5,500-member observer force would depend on all
sides being committed to end the fighting.

   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, 1937, the hydrogen-filled German dirigible Hindenburg
burned and crashed in Lakehurst, N.J., killing 35 of the 97 people
on board and a Navy crewman on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On this date:
</P>
<P>
   In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the Union.
</P>
<P>
   In 1889, the Paris Exposition formally opened, featuring the
just-completed Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, Britain's King Edward VII died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, the Works Progress Administration began operating.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, during World War II, some 15,000 Americans and
Filipinos on Corregidor surrendered to the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, medical student Roger Bannister broke the four-minute
mile during a track meet in Oxford, England, in three minutes, 59.4
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Britain's Princess Margaret married Anthony
Armstrong-Jones, a commoner, at Westminster Abbey. (They divorced
in 1978.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, actress Marlene Dietrich died at her Paris home at age
90.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, former Arkansas state worker Paula Jones filed suit
against President Clinton, alleging he sexually harassed her in
1991. (Jones reached a settlement with Clinton in November 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and French President
Francois Mitterrand formally opened the Channel Tunnel between
their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago: Freed American hostage Frank Reed said at a news
conference in Arlington, Va., that he had been savagely beaten by
his captors in Lebanon after two unsuccessful escape attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: Friends and relatives of the Oklahoma City
bombing victims made a pilgrimage to the site of the attack. In
London, thousands of World War II veterans celebrated the 50th
anniversary of V-E Day. Long-shot Thunder Gulch won the 121st
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: Russia and the Western powers set aside their
differences over NATO airstrikes and drafted a joint plan to end
the Kosovo conflict. President Clinton met with Kosovo refugees in
Germany, listening to accounts of murder, rape and terror and
promising them, ''You will go home again in safety and in
freedom.'' Reversing decades of overwhelming loyalty to Britain's
governing Labor Party, Scottish and Welsh voters elected strong
nationalist oppositions to their first separate assemblies of
modern times.

<HEADLINE> Name To Be Added to Viet Memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The name of a Marine who died three years ago
-- 30 years after he was injured in the Vietnam War -- will be added
to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Monday, a veterans group said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Cpl. David O. Kamp's name will bring the number
of inscriptions on the memorial to 58,220, Jan Scruggs, president
of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The policy for a new name is that only those who die of a combat
wound suffered in Vietnam be added to the memorial wall. The
Defense Department makes the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp, of Muskegon, Mich., was shot in the neck on December 27,
1967, a wound that left him paralyzed from the neck down. Kamp
surprised doctors and his family by living for nearly 30 years
after his injury. He died on March 29, 1997, of sepsis, a poisoning
of the blood by infection, Scruggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp's name will be officially recognized on May 29 during the
annual Memorial Day observance at the Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated in 1982, the memorial honors the men and women of the
U.S. Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam War and lists the names
of those who died. More than 2.5 million people go to the Wall each
year, making it the most visited memorial in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Ty Sues Over Beanie Babies Promotion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The company that makes Beanie Babies is upset
that the Tropicana hotel-casino used its wildly popular plush toys
in a slot machine promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Inc. hit the Tropicana's operator, Aztar Corp., with a
copyright infringement lawsuit in Las Vegas federal court
Wednesday. Ty demanded all profits Tropicana has derived from the
slot promotion, plus an unspecified amount of damages.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the ''Beanie Babies Giveaway Slots,'' a promotion
that gives away the toys in exchange for slot play. Mixing its
product with slots, Ty claims, ''has tarnished or is likely to
tarnish (Ty's) famous trademarks.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Aztar did not return a message seeking comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Photo exhibits included with the Ty lawsuit show a colorful sign
over a bank of slots with depictions of four Beanie Babies and Ty's
heart trademark.
</P>
<P>
   The signs also include disclaimers: ''The Tropicana Hotel-Casino
is not affiliated with Ty Corp.'' and ''Ty and Beanie Babies are
trademarks of Ty Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Ty said that it wasn't asked for permission to run the
promotion, but that anyone looking at the billboard would assume it
had Ty's blessing.

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews 'Wonderful Town'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Something wonderful is going on at City Center
this weekend and it is not just because the title of its latest
''Encores!'' concert offering is ''Wonderful Town,'' the Leonard
Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green musical.
</P>
<P>
   The show always has been associated with its original star,
Rosalind Russell, who put her own stamp on the role of Ruth
Sherwood, aspiring writer who moves to New York's Greenwich Village
in 1935 with her little sister Eileen. It's an affectionate, funny
look at a New York that probably never was, a big small town where
wide-eyed tourists can chirp in the opening number, ''Ain't it
quaint, ain't it sweet, such interesting people on Christopher
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, through Sunday, you can witness another talented performer,
Donna Murphy, makes Russell's role her own. It's quite a takeover.
Murphy, best known for such serious efforts as ''Hello Again,''
''The King and I'' and especially Stephen Sondheim's ''Passion,''
displays a sense of comedy, both verbal and physical, that lifts
this already buoyant musical right up to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Like Russell, Murphy is an actress first. All her comedy comes
out of the character. No cartoon antics here, which may be why the
slender, almost revue-like book by Joseph Fields and Jerome
Chodorov seems more sturdy than it actually is.
</P>
<P>
   If Ruth has journeyed to New York to become a writer, pretty
little sister Eileen wants to become an actress. In the process,
she attracts half the men in New York, including what seems to be
the entire New York police force.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's music draws on the rhythms and raucousness of New
York, rhythms he mined earlier in ''On the Town'' and would do so
again, with even greater effect and more seriousness of purpose, in
''West Side Story.'' From the opening 'Christopher Street'' to the
'Wrong Note Rag,'' the show celebrates the big city in all its raw
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Comden and Green's lyrics are brashly funny, approaching
burlesque but with an affection for the characters, of course, that
gives the show its considerable good cheer. No wonder such love
songs as ''A Little Bit in Love,'' ''A Quiet Girl'' and the soaring
'It's Love,'' touch the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Director and choreographer Kathleen Marshall has so completely
staged the musical that it seems more of a full-fledged production
than a concert. Her dances are as witty as the score, particularly
her sly dig at ''Riverdance'' in the beguiling Irish ditty ''My
Darlin' Eileen.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall also has cast the show well. In the pivotal role of
Eileen, Laura Benanti fulfills the considerable promise she
displayed in ''Swing!'' and the revival of ''The Sound of Music.''
Benanti possesses a soaring musical theater voice and an appealing
presence that nicely matches the more acerbic Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Muenz gives fine, understated support as Ruth's eventual
suitor, while David Aaron Baker and Gregory Jbara score as two of
Eileen's many admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Musicals are the ultimate in collaboration, on and off-stage.
This version of ''Wonderful Town'' amply demonstrates what happens
when all are working at the top of their form.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened in Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN MCNAMARA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- College campuses closed, militants
protested and the National Guard shielded U.S. installations and
public utilities Friday following a federal raid that dislodged 216
protesters from the Navy's bombing range on Vieques Island.
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, an anti-Navy activist claimed that seven people were
still hiding on the range. The Navy said it knew of no holdouts and
was planning to rapidly resume training -- a year after its Atlantic
fleet bombing range was occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Protests against the raid also were announced on the U.S.
mainland. In downtown Philadelphia, about 100 people protesting
outside a Navy recruiting office snarled evening rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has unified the Puerto Rican people like nothing I have
ever seen in my life,'' said Philadelphia City Councilman Angel
Ortiz. ''All of the resentments about the colonial situation are
being exhibited through Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a commonwealth arrangement, the 4 million American
citizens who live on Puerto Rico can serve in the military but
cannot vote for president or Congress. They receive $13 billion a
year in U.S. aid but pay no federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, police increased security at Army and Navy
bases, federal courts in San Juan and at U.S. military recruiting
and post offices. Hundreds of protesters briefly scuffled with
police at the U.S. Army base at Fort Buchanan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pedro Rossello ordered enhanced security at public
utilities. National Guard troops stood watch at power plants,
including one at San Juan's international airport, said utility
spokesman Freddy Marrero.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5,000 members of the electricity workers union staged a
four-hour protest Friday against the Vieques raid.
</P>
<P>
   In historic Old San Juan, hundreds of flag-waving protesters
demonstrated peacefully outside a newly renovated federal
courthouse hours before it was to be dedicated by judges and local
officials. But when former Gov. Luis A. Ferre arrived for the
ceremony, several militant protesters smashed the window of his
car. Ferre was not hurt
</P>
<P>
   Protests by students -- and in some cases their professors -- shut
down classes at colleges in the cities of Ponce and Bayamon and
disrupted many classes at the University of Puerto Rico's main
campus in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, where about 300 federal agents peacefully removed
216 protesters from the bombing range Thursday -- including
religious leaders and two U.S. members of Congress -- an activist
claimed that some had eluded the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Zenon, head of the Vieques Fishermen's Association, said
seven people, including two of his sons, were at two ''secret
camps'' in the hilly zone. Zenon said he had spoken with son
Casimar by radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they find them, they'll surrender peacefully,'' Zenon said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Mark McDonald, a spokesman at the Joint
Information Center at Roosevelt Roads, said military personnel were
patrolling the range but had no information on any holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters occupied the Navy's 60-year-old Atlantic fleet range
in April 1999 after a civilian Navy guard was killed in an
accidental bombing. They stood in the way of a Jan. 31 accord
between President Clinton and Rossello allowing the Navy to resume
limited training with inert bombs until 2003, with a Vieques
referendum to decide whether the Navy can stay longer and use live
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy argues Vieques is vital to national security because it
is the only place that air, land and sea forces can train
simultaneously with live munitions before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Puerto Rico's House of Representatives voted 32-8 to
ask the U.S. Congress to immediately set a date for the Vieques
referendum. Under Clinton's directive, the Navy can set a date
anytime between Aug. 1 of this year and Feb. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thursday's detentions -- all protesters were released
without charge -- many Puerto Ricans celebrated the outcome because
it attracted international attention to the plight of Vieques'
9,300 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got us out, but it is a disgrace for the nation that
calls itself the architect of democracy that it had to use warships
with more than 1,000 soldiers, armed with all of their equipment,
to remove a few people who are demanding peace,'' said Vieques
fisherman Carlos Ventura.

<HEADLINE> Argentines Protest Labor Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Thousands of Argentines stayed
home from work Friday as part of a 24-hour strike to protest the
government's plan to overhaul labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Transport workers, bus drivers, teachers, and some state
employees were among those who answered union leaders' call to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wake-up call for the government, so that they see
the drastic situation'' in which a lot of Argentines are living,
said labor leader Hugo Moyano.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was the latest protest organized by dissident union
groups, and came three weeks after police and demonstrators clashed
outside Congress on a day the Senate was slated to debate the new
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The government and union groups offered differing figures on the
number of people who observed Friday's strike. Interior Minister
Federico Storani said one-third of the country's 14 million working
people took part; union officials put the number as high as 85
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Public transport buses idled, and public school classrooms sat
empty in the northern Jujuy, the news agency Diarios y Noticias
reported. In the country's second-largest city, Cordoba, assembly
lines at car factory plants idled, while in San Luis truck drivers
blocked several major roads.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando De la Rua expressed dismay over the strike,
calling it counterproductive to his efforts to get Argentina's
economy back on track after a two-year recession.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters: ''As you all see, I didn't stop. I'm
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor reform is considered a centerpiece of De la Rua's efforts
toward long-term recovery and economic expansion. The labor reform
bill was passed last week by the Senate, and calls for extending
the trial period for new hires and lowering employer payroll
contributions for new workers. The lower house of Congress must now
vote on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the reforms will boost wage flexibility and
create more jobs, while reducing the cost of doing business. But
labor leaders claim the changes will hurt workers and do nothing to
ease the country's 14 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   With many bus and subway train drivers reportedly taking part in
the strike, rush hour traffic was snarled in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luna, a 22-year-old construction worker, complained that
his 15-minute commute had been stretched to 45 minutes because of
the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the stoppage will solve anything. This just
hurts the people who are working,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Putin Faces Daunting Task  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL HAVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Days before his inauguration as Russian
president, U.S. experts on Friday painted a grim picture of the
task Vladimir Putin faces as inheritor of a politically-fragmented
and depression-mired country.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, was ''a wrecking ball of
gigantic proportions,'' Padma Desai, an economics professor at
Columbia University's Harriman Institute, said at an annual
conference on relations between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin did away with the communist infrastructure of the
Soviet-era, but didn't replace it with the institutions necessary
for a functioning economy, according to many of the Russia experts
at the gathering, which was sponsored by The Associated Press and
the Harriman Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Graham of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
likened Russia to the feudal Europe of centuries past -- controlled
by competing bands of powerful elite and lacking centralized
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are elements of a democracy, but they have not developed
into a system,'' said Graham, who was a senior official at the U.S.
embassy in Moscow from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Russia posted an $850 million budget surplus for the first four
months of this year, but the economy is still plagued by corruption
and deep structural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB agent who was elected in March and will be
inaugurated on Sunday, has promised to double Russia's gross
domestic product within 10 years and trim the government's role in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed Putin must create a better climate for international
investment, rein in powerful regional politicians, and clean up
corruption, many at the conference said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he has the ability or the inclination to do so is open
to doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a man of limited horizons,'' Graham said, and ''there are
real limits to what Putin or any other president of Russia can
do.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Celebrates Cinco de Mayo  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico celebrated its most famous military
victory -- the May 5, 1862, Battle of Puebla -- with a re-enactment
in Mexico City's main square of the defeat of invading French
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The 138th anniversary celebration of what has become known as
''Cinco de Mayo,'' featured rifle and machete-toting ranks of
Mexican irregular ''soldiers'' clad in broad straw hats, blasting
away at French ''invaders'' wearing fancy red-and-blue uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   A national holiday here and a celebration of Mexican national
pride abroad, the anniversary of the battle commemorates the
country's five-year struggle to throw off the occupying army which
invaded in 1861 and was withdrawn by France in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I invite you, wherever you are, to always feel the pride
of being Mexican,'' President Ernesto Zedillo said in a speech in
the main square.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to the millions of Mexicans who
celebrate Cinco de Mayo abroad, mainly in the United States,
Zedillo said: ''Wherever we are found, we always express and honor
our love for Mexico, with all our hearts and our heads held high.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans regard Cinco de Mayo as perhaps the proudest day in
their nation's history. But the victory in the 1862 battle was
short-lived: French troops occupied the city of Puebla, 65 miles
east of the capital, the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The French invaders then defeated the Mexican army, forced the
government to flee and occupied all of southern Mexico, but
continued to encounter resistance which eventually led them to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1862 battle, 5,200 well-armed French troops backed by
cavalry and artillery attempted to lay siege to Puebla and its two
forts.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Gen. Ignacio Zaragoza had a ragged army of only 4,870
men, armed mostly with old rifles and machetes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mexicans were fighting on home ground, and in a series
of skillful maneuvers, they so bloodied the French that the
invaders had to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The French suffered 1,139 casualties, among killed and wounded.
The Mexicans counted 490 killed and 210 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say a total of 190,000 rifle rounds were fired along
with 2,150 cannon balls between the two forces.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect To Face Psych Exam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A man accused of opening fire inside a suburban
senior citizens complex and killing three women will undergo tests
to determine if he's sane.
</P>
<P>
   After a judge granted defense attorney Gabi Silver's request for
a competency examination, Kenneth Miller, 56, was transferred
Friday from jail to the state Center for Forensic Psychiatry where
he'll be tested to determine whether he understands the murder
charges against him and can help in his defense. The tests will
take about six weeks or longer, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Miller opened fire after an April 18 meeting with
housing officials that had been called to discuss allegations he
used vulgar language. Mary Parsley, 55, Marilyn Higgins, 64, and
Alvita King, 70, were killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has claimed not to remember any details of the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   During the initial attempt to arraign Miller on April 21, Judge
David Bajorek halted the proceedings, saying he wasn't confident
Miller understood the charges. Miller appeared confused and often
interrupted Bajorek.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Flag Sparks Controversy  </HEADLINE>
By GINA HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The governor on Friday created a
commission to recommend a design for Mississippi's flag, a day
after the state Supreme Court said the current state flag -- with
its Confederate emblem -- does not violate the rights of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ronnie Musgrove said blacks and whites, Republicans and
Democrats will serve on the 17-member panel, adding: ''We want a
good open, honest discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission must have a recommendation on the flag and
another state symbol, the coat of arms, by May 2001. Musgrove did
not say if he would call lawmakers into a special session to vote
on the recommendation or allow the issue to wait until the 2002
session.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Thursday, the Supreme Court pointed out that the
state hasn't had an official flag for 94 years and said lawmakers,
not the courts, should determine state flags. Mississippi lawmakers
have distanced themselves from a debate over the flag for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove, a Democrat who took office in January, had maintained
there were more pressing matters for legislators to consider than
the flag, but said the court ruling changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   In setting up the commission, he also issued an executive order
making the flag the official symbol until lawmakers vote on a
commission recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks who view the flag as racist celebrated the chance for
debate on a new flag. White supporters in the Legislature predicted
lawmakers will simply make official the flag that has been used for
106 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed the debate could turn bitter, just as in South
Carolina where blacks led an economic boycott over that state's
flying of the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''For once in my life I'll be able to hear the debate on what
flag we'll have,'' said Democratic Rep. Frances Fredericks, who's
black. ''This is a chance for Mississippi to bring closure to an
issue and unity for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Steve Holland said ''the votes are there, right or
wrong,'' to keep the flag which includes the Confederate battle
flag in the upper left corner.

<HEADLINE> Peru Said Not Ready for Fair Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- U.S. election observers said Friday that
President Alberto Fujimori's government has failed to take minimum
steps to ensure a fair and open runoff vote for president on May
28.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequence is that the process at this moment continues
to fall well short of the standards that are required,'' Patrick
Merloe, head of the joint mission of the National Democratic
Institute and Carter Center, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing that's critical is that the electoral system,
particularly the counting of the votes, has to be open to
verification because the population of this country has no
confidence in the electoral organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Fujimori and economist Alejandro Toledo in a dead
heat in the runoff race after a first-round campaign and April 9
vote riddled with irregularities and allegations of government
abuses and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has threatened Fujimori with economic and
diplomatic sanctions if conditions do not improve.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has denied allegations that fraud played a part in the
first vote. He has downplayed the significance of widespread
irregularities that he says had no affect on the results.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Fujimori's party and Toledo's political camp came
to an abrupt halt late Thursday after three days of closed-door
negotiations to improve campaign conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Friday he had broken off talks: ''We were able to
confirm that there was no political will whatsoever to improve the
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Tudela, Fujimori's vice-presidential candidate and a
member of the negotiating team, angrily accused Toledo's camp of
bargaining in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Tudela said he hoped the dialogue could resume, and neither side
ruled out holding a debate between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A key sticking point was access to Peru's mostly pro-government
television networks, which the observers mission said has waged a
smear campaign against Toledo and continues to deny him adequate
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said none of the major networks covered his opening
second-round rally, which drew tens of thousands of supporters
Wednesday night in the southern Andean city of Arequipa.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor's Farewell Begins  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of mourners silently watched the start
of a four-day farewell to Cardinal John O'Connor on Friday in
services held at his beloved St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ''His work is done, and now he's home,'' Bishop Patrick
Sheridan, the cathedral's vicar general, said during a special rite
observing O'Connor's final homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Organ music swelled and the church bells rang as by eight
pallbearers carried the casket inside the grand cathedral where
O'Connor conducted countless memorials for New York heroes both
famous and obscure. The congregation sang a hymn, ''Now From the
Heavens Descending,'' as the pallbearers -- joined by a phalanx of
priests, nuns and altar servers -- slowly marched through the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-minute service marked O'Connor's return to the Manhattan
church where he presided for 16 years as the nation's
highest-profile Roman Catholic. O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday night
in his residence behind the cathedral after battling cancer for
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''He held fast to the traditions handed to him,'' said a teary
Ralph Giordano, 23, who stood on the sidewalk opposite St.
Patrick's. ''I trusted him for that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's dark wood coffin was carried through the ornate
brass doors of the Fifth Avenue church, then brought up the aisle
and placed at the front of the main altar.
</P>
<P>
   A steady flow of mourners -- estimated at 10,000 -- was soon
marching past the open casket to bid a final goodbye to the late
spiritual leader of the archdiocese's 2.4 million faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt inspired and touched,'' said Frank Zizzo of Levittown.
''He looked incredibly at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's body will be on view Saturday and Sunday near his
now empty chair -- the official archbishop's ''cathedra.'' The
funeral Mass was scheduled for Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal will be buried in the crypt beneath St. Patrick's
altar, where all the previous archbishops of New York are buried.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, a special Mass was celebrated by the cardinal's
former secretary, Bishop James McCarthy of the St. Elizabeth Ann
Seton parish in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some have asked what will be his legacy,'' McCarthy said.
''May I suggest one: He saved lives -- the lives of the unborn, the
lives of the poor, the lives of those in war-torn nations.''

<HEADLINE> Others Plead Guilty in Vitamin Plot  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two U.S. and two German drug companies agreed
to plead guilty and pay $33 million in fines for participating in a
conspiracy to fix the price of vitamins sold worldwide, the Justice
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   In criminal cases filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Dallas,
the department charged that Nepera Inc., based in Harriman, N.Y.,
and Reilly Industries Inc. of Indianapolis conspired with others to
raise and fix the price and control the supply of vitamin B3, also
known as niacin.
</P>
<P>
   Two Nepera executives also pleaded guilty in separate cases for
their roles and agreed to pay fines and serve prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The German company Degussa-Huls AG was charged separately in the
vitamin B3 conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a sixth case, Merck KgaA, also based in Germany, was accused
of a plot to similarly fix the price and control supplies of
vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's cases, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division
will have collected more than $758 million from 24 prosecutions
against participants in international vitamin cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to vigorously pursue convictions and
significant sentences against corporations and businesses who
violate U.S. antitrust laws to the detriment of American
consumers,'' said Joel Klein, assistant attorney general for the
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials say the vitamin conspiracy lasted
from January 1990 to February 1999 and affected the price of
vitamins commonly used as nutritional supplements or to enrich
human food, such as milk and bread, as well as in animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   In the conspiracy, the European and U.S. companies agreed to
increase and maintain prices and to limit supplies of the vitamins
A, B2, B3, B5, C and E.
</P>
<P>
   Merck will pay a $14 million fine for its role in vitamin C
price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   In the B3 conspiracy, Degussa-Huls will pay a fine of $13
million, Nepera of $4 million and Reilly Industries of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Noack, former Nepera president, agreed to serve eight
months in prison and pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the
conspiracy. David Purpi, the company's former vice president for
sales and marketing, accepted a prison sentence of a year and a day
and a $100,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Among other companies implicated in the vitamin conspiracy, the
Swiss-based pharmaceutical company Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. pleaded
guilty last May and agreed to a $500 million fine, the largest
federal criminal fine ever imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, a German firm, BASF AG, agreed to pay a $225
million fine for its role in the conspiracy.

Bank Privacy Plan Is Delayed

Mexico Celebrates Cinco de Mayo
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico celebrated its most famous military victory -- the
May 5, 1862, Battle of Puebla -- with a re-enactment in Mexico City's main
square of the defeat of invading French forces. The 138th anniversary
celebration of what has become known as ''Cinco de Mayo,'' featured rifle and
machete-toting ranks of Mexican irregular ''soldiers'' clad in broad straw hats,
blasting away at French ''invaders'' wearing fancy red-and-blue uniforms. The
anniversary of the battle commemorates the country's five-year struggle to throw
off the occupying army which invaded in 1861 and was withdrawn by France in
1866.

McGwire Hits Record Longest Homer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark McGwire of St. Louis hit an upper-deck homer tonight
that was estimated as the longest ever in Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium.
McGwire's solo shot in the fourth inning off Ron Villone landed an estimated 473
feet from home plate, 10 feet farther than a drive by Eric Anthony in 1995.
Riverfront Stadium opened in 1970 and the Reds have estimated homers for about
the last 15 years.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The District of Columbia's embattled chief
financial officer announced Friday that she is quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Holt said in a statement that she will step down on May
19.
</P>
<P>
   Holt has been at the center of controversy in recent weeks. The
capital city's annual financial report was more than three months
late, sparking a review by the district's congressionally appointed
Financial Control Board.
</P>

   Holt blamed a new computer system for the delay. Critics said
she declined help from the control board and hid the problems from
Mayor Anthony Williams and the D.C. Council until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's statement made no mention of the controversy and gave ''a
new career challenge'' as the reason for her departure.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protesters Disrupt Philly  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Political activists angered by the arrest of
protesters on Vieques Island near Puerto Rico disrupted rush-hour
traffic in downtown Philadelphia Friday.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people gathered outside a Navy recruiting office to
protest the federal raid Thursday that dislodged 216 protesters
from the Navy's bombing range on Vieques Island.
</P>
<P>
   After standing by for about an hour, police arrested 15
protesters who were sitting in the middle of Broad Street, a major
thoroughfare. A city councilman was among those arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''That today we can witness this bombing is horrible,'' said
protester Pedro Rodriguez, of Philadelphia. ''The Navy still has
the mentality of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, about 40 people pitched tents in front of the John F.
Kennedy Federal Building late Friday, and an organizer said about
half planned to stay through the night. No arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Yankees-Orioles game was interrupted briefly
Friday night when eight protesters ran onto the field at Yankee
Stadium, waving Puerto Rican flags. Security guards tackled them
and escorted them from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican protesters had occupied the Navy's 60-year-old
Atlantic fleet training range on Vieques in April 1999 after a
civilian Navy guard was killed in an accidental bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the military presence on Vieques maintain that the
military is responsible for environmental degradation, abnormally
high rates of cancer and other illnesses among the island's 9,300
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy argues Vieques is vital to national security because it
is the only place that air, land and sea forces can train
simultaneously with live munitions before deploying abroad.

<HEADLINE> Latvian Parliament OKs New Govt.  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN C. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvia's parliament on Friday approved a new
center-right government led by Andris Berzins, a popular former
mayor of Riga who has pledged to maintain the Baltic state's
pro-reform, pro-West course.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-seat Saeima parliament voted along party lines, 69 to
24, to approve the government with Berzins at its helm. Seven
deputies either weren't present or didn't vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to assembled deputies before the vote, Berzins said
he was committed to the open-market economic policies adhered to by
all of Latvia's governments since the country regained independence
following the 1991 Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also keep pushing for Latvian membership in the
European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that we maintain our foreign policy goals, and
by promoting Latvian integration into the EU and trans-Atlantic
security structures we do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was delayed after virtually all the deputies, and
Berzins, gathered around television sets outside the parliament
hall to watch the final minutes of a world ice hockey championship
game between Latvia and Russia, which Latvia won 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition includes all the parties that made up the previous
government -- Berzins' centrist Latvia's Way and People's Party, and
the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom -- plus the small, centrist
New Party. Combined they have 69 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Berzins, a former history teacher, has been one of Latvia's most
popular politicians. He won praise as Riga's recent mayor for
reviving the capital's business district.

<HEADLINE> D'Amico To Start Tuesday for Brewers  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Desperate for starting pitching, the Milwaukee
Brewers plan to recall right-hander Jeff D'Amico and put him in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The team said D'Amico will make his first major-league start
since September 1997 when Milwaukee visits the Chicago Cubs on
Tuesday. He will be recalled sometime before then.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of rehabilitation from arthroscopic
shoulder surgery, D'Amico pitched in Milwaukee's penultimate game
of 1999. He missed the 1998 season after going 9-7 with the Brewers
the year before, his first full campaign in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico pitched two innings for Triple-A Indianapolis on Friday
night, allowing one run, two walks and a homer in two innings. He
is 1-1 with a 3.16 ERA in Indianapolis after barely missing a spot
in the Brewers' rotation during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the rotation spot of Everett Stull (1-3, 7.77 ERA), who
walked 12 and lasted 5 2-3 innings in his last two starts combined.
Spring training injuries to projected rotation members John Snyder,
Jamey Wright and Kyle Peterson further thinned the Brewers' already
shallow staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to have really any success until we get some
quality starts,'' Milwaukee manager Davey Lopes said. ''We're not
getting any consistency from our rotation, and it's forcing us to
exploit our strengths in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who opened a three-game series with Montreal on
Friday night, have lost their last six series. Starter Jason Bere
allowed 10 runs to the Expos in the first two innings on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers have slumped to last place in the NL Central with
pitching problems and a prolonged offensive slump. Milwaukee's team
batting average is .231, last in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Only a stellar April by Milwaukee's bullpen has kept the Brewers
from reaching new depths. The bullpen, led by closer Bob Wickman
and nearly unhittable setup man David Weathers, has a 2.68 ERA with
48 strikeouts in its last 57 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the bullpen's depth has been exploited by the rotation's
poor starts. Already this season, Milwaukee released Jaime Navarro
(0-5, 12.54), who will make a team-high $5 million this year but
couldn't get past the fifth inning in any of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' rotation also features Steve Woodard (0-4, 5.88),
who hasn't won in 15 straight starts dating back to July 16.
Woodard was projected to be Milwaukee's No. 1 starter this year by
manager Davey Lopes.

Patrick Merloe, head of the joint mission of the National Democratic Institute

Toledo in a dead heat in the runoff race after a first-round campaign and April
9 vote riddled with irregularities and allegations of government abuses and

proportions,'' Padma Desai, an economics professor at Columbia University's
Harriman Institute, said at an annual conference on relations between Russia and

Soviet-era, but didn't replace it with the institutions necessary for a
functioning economy, according to many of the Russia experts at the gathering.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Seek NIreland Impasse End  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The prime ministers of Britain
and Ireland announced an ambitious plan Friday for restoring power
to Northern Ireland's suspended Catholic-Protestant administration
by May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking shortly before midnight following more than 30 hours of
negotiations with local parties, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair said all sides had agreed to
consider a ''target date'' for resuming power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two governments have put proposals to the parties, and
subject to a positive response, it will be the intention of the
governments to reinstate the institutions on the 22nd of May,''
Blair said at Hillsborough Castle, the negotiating venue southwest
of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   May 22 is the second anniversary of the overwhelming
ratification of the Good Friday peace accord in public referendums.
The historic pact also made the date the deadline for Northern
Ireland's rival paramilitary groups to disarm, an unfulfilled goal
that has repeatedly stymied wider political progress.
</P>
<P>
   A linchpin of the prime ministers' new plan is to extend that
deadline for total disarmament to June 2001 -- a concession likely
to fuel Protestant opposition to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A four-party coalition involving the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party
took office in Northern Ireland in December, but Britain suspended
the administration's powers in February after the Irish Republican
Army refused to begin disarming as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both Blair and Ahern emphasized that they couldn't force
Protestant politicians to resume sharing power with Sinn Fein. They
said, a positive response soon from the outlawed IRA would be
essential for the four-party administration to regain its authority
by May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now incumbent upon the parties, and perhaps in particular
the paramilitary organizations, to give their response to the
proposals we've made,'' Blair said, Ahern standing at his side. ''I
very much hope that that response is positive, and in particular
that we can make sure that the arms issue is dealt with completely
and verifiably.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern added, ''I'd be very disappointed if the response from the
paramilitaries was not extremely positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, speaking minutes after the prime
ministers, said he welcomed the publication of the governments'
joint plan as ''a very decisive moment.'' But he declined to
speculate on how the IRA would respond.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the two governments said they expected the IRA to
issue a new policy statement this weekend confirming the outlawed
group's intention to resume talks with the disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday the United States ''remains
prepared to assist'' the continuing peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge the parties and paramilitary organizations to seize
this opportunity to realize these goals in order to restore lasting
peace to the people of Northern Ireland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Northern Ireland's peace process gathered pace in
1993, Britain and the province's Protestant majority have demanded
gradual IRA disarmament as the price for including Sinn Fein in
Northern Ireland's government.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRA, observing a cease-fire since 1997, has until now
steadfastly refused to give any disarmament commitments. The rebels
withdrew from negotiations with the province's disarmament
commission in February after Britain resumed direct rule of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant
politician who had led the short-lived coalition, said before
Blair's dramatic announcement that he'd be willing to resume work
alongside Sinn Fein if the IRA gave a firm commitment to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, speaking minutes after Blair, said
he welcomed the publication of the governments' joint plan -- but
declined to speculate on how the IRA would respond.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 5, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Red Sox pounded the AL's worst pitching staff
for five doubles, two by Brian Daubach, and Carl Everett hit his
ninth homer as Boston beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-3 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays started the day with a 6.12 ERA. Only Colorado's
6.15 in the NL was worse. Boston, meanwhile, entered the game with
the AL's best ERA, 3.82.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a run in the first, Ramon Martinez (2-2) was
staked to a 5-1 lead after four innings. He gave up two more runs
before leaving with no outs in the sixth, but Rich Garces and Derek
Lowe, who got his sixth save, shut down the Devil Rays the rest of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good start to the season series for Boston, which was
4-9 against Tampa Bay last year. Texas and Oakland were the only
other teams to win season series against Boston last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, who lost for the fifth time in six games, took a
1-0 lead in the first on a leadoff triple by Gerald Williams and a
single by Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox tied it against Dave Eiland (1-1) in the bottom half
on back-to-back doubles by Trot Nixon and Daubach. They went ahead
2-1 in the third on a single by Nixon, a double by Daubach and a
sacrifice fly by Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   They added three runs in the fourth. Everett hit the first pitch
of the inning for a homer, another set of consecutive doubles by
Jason Varitek and Wilton Veras produced the second run and Jose
Offerman singled in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tampa Bay chipped away with a run in the fifth on a double
by Tony Graffanino and a single by Williams and another run in the
sixth on Jose Canseco's fifth homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff then singled, chasing Martinez with Boston's lead
in jeopardy. Martinez allowed three runs and eight hits in five
innings. Garces came in with the score 5-3, no outs and a runner on
first. The situation worsened when McGriff took second on Varitek's
passed ball and Vinny Castilla walked.
</P>
<P>
   Mike DiFelice then hit a deep drive over Nixon's head, but the
right fielder raced to the wall to make an over-the-shoulder catch
as McGriff moved to third. Then Garces got out of trouble by
striking out Kevin Stocker and Graffanino.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Eiland had tightness in his left quadriceps when he left
the game with one out in the fourth. ... Offerman came into the
game in a 3-for-30 slump and struck out in his first at-bat. But he
singled on his next three trips to the plate. ... Boston had at
least one homer for the sixth straight game and for the 11th game
in its last 12.

<HEADLINE> Critics Denounce New Air Bag Rules  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced new air bag standards
Friday that seek to improve protection of children and small
adults. Critics contend larger adults who don't wear seat belts
could be put at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule overhauls the government's standards for air bags,
which to date are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives and
blamed for at least 158 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants
in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather
than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph standard will be phased in over three years, starting
with 2004 model year vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and
small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags
that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph test will not require the air bags to inflate as
forcefully as a 30 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, we focused on the most vulnerable and
the most at-risk of being killed by the air bags that were supposed
to benefit them,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups say the new standard will put more adults
at risk because the bags will not be designed to deploy with enough
force to protect unbelted larger adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a 30 mph standard because people are more likely to be
killed or seriously injured in higher-speed crashes, and this is
where air bags have saved the most lives,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA required a 30 mph test until 1997, when worries about air
bags injuring motorists caused the agency to approve a rule that
temporarily allowed automakers to use a 25 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than change the test, Claybrook said automakers should
install dual-power air bags that would inflate at different speeds
depending on the severity of impact and size of the occupant.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason the auto industry wants the 25 mph test,
Claybrook said, is that popular sport utility vehicles cannot meet
the 30 mph standard because of stiff designs that do not absorb
impact as well as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers
rejected that argument. If it were true, he said, the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trauma Society and the
National Transportation Safety Board would not support the 25 mph
test as the safer alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly not about saving money or about protecting any
classification of vehicle,'' Roberts said. ''This rule is going to
go so much further in enhancing vehicle safety, it's
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also will require vehicles to be tested using a family of
dummies -- an average-size man, a small woman and 1-, 3- and
6-year-old children. Previous tests involved only average-size men.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world
conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger
seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying
positions.

<HEADLINE> New Air Bag Rules Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced new air bag standards
Friday that seek to improve protection of children and small
adults. Critics contend larger adults who don't wear seat belts
could be put at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule overhauls the government's standards for air bags,
which to date are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives and
blamed for at least 158 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants
in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather
than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph standard will be phased in over three years, starting
with 2004 model year vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and
small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags
that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph test will not require the air bags to inflate as
forcefully as a 30 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, we focused on the most vulnerable and
the most at-risk of being killed by the air bags that were supposed
to benefit them,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups say the new standard will put more adults
at risk because the bags will not be designed to deploy with enough
force to protect unbelted larger adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a 30 mph standard because people are more likely to be
killed or seriously injured in higher-speed crashes, and this is
where air bags have saved the most lives,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA required a 30 mph test until 1997, when worries about air
bags injuring motorists caused the agency to approve a rule that
temporarily allowed automakers to use a 25 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than change the test, Claybrook said automakers should
install dual-power air bags that would inflate at different speeds
depending on the severity of impact and size of the occupant.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason the auto industry wants the 25 mph test,
Claybrook said, is that popular sport utility vehicles cannot meet
the 30 mph standard because of stiff designs that do not absorb
impact as well as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers
rejected that argument. If it were true, he said, the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trauma Society and the
National Transportation Safety Board would not support the 25 mph
test as the safer alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly not about saving money or about protecting any
classification of vehicle,'' Roberts said. ''This rule is going to
go so much further in enhancing vehicle safety, it's
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also will require vehicles to be tested using a family of
dummies -- an average-size man, a small woman and 1-, 3- and
6-year-old children. Previous tests involved only average-size men.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world
conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger
seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying
positions.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA estimates the new standards will increase costs by less
than $100 per vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Chimp Protection Urged in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) -- African governments should beef up
protection for the continent's chimpanzees that are being hunted
down in their forest homes, conservationists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Half a ton of bush meat, mostly of chimps, is transported to
Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, every day,'' said Debbie Cox, an
Australian wildlife expert who runs a chimpanzee sanctuary in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates at a workshop on chimpanzee sanctuaries said the
animals face extinction in countries like Cameroon and Congo, where
people eat their meat.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least 30 chimps are eaten per day in Congo, and hundreds of
others smuggled out of the country,'' Cox told reporters at the end
of the five-day meeting organized by the Conservation Breeding
Specialist Group and the Jane Goodall Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Participants representing 12 of the 15 chimpanzee sanctuaries in
Africa recommended that governments officially designate forests
inhabited by chimpanzees as protected areas. They should also
enhance protection of existing forest reserves, provide more money
to wildlife authorities and establish corridors for the primates
migrations.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Norman Rosen of California State University said up to
25 percent of the chimpanzees in Kibaale forest in western Uganda
limp from injuries inflicted by snares.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics presented at the meeting indicated that chimps number
between 130,000 and 150,000 in Africa, about 98 percent of world's
population. Other chimpanzees are in zoos and research
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we allow these species to become extinct, the whole
ecosystem will crumble because they keep up the rain forests of
Africa,'' Cox said, adding that the primates are genetically closer
to humans than are gorillas.

<HEADLINE> SF Bomb Threat Caller Given Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A man who called in a bomb threat to San
Francisco International Airport hoping to delay a Korea-bound plane
so his girlfriend could catch the flight was sentenced Friday to 10
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Flavio David Mendoza, 35, told U.S. District Judge Charles Legge
that he had not intended to harm anybody when he made the call Dec.
30.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was always respectful of the law,'' Mendoza said. ''After
this experience, I will be even more respectful of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Mendoza in March of communicating false
information, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Several calls Mendoza made to try to get the airplane delayed
were rebuffed before he made the threatening call. The plane, which
was routed back to San Francisco when the threat was made,
continued to Seoul when the hoax was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   To believe you are ''30,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean with a
bomb on board certainly has to be one of the most harrowing''
experiences the flight crew has experienced, federal prosecutor
Dave Hall said.

<HEADLINE> McVeigh Seeks Appeal Dismissal Halt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh has
asked a federal court to deny the government's effort to throw out
his latest bid for a new trial, saying he deserves another day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply to federal prosecutors' motion to dismiss his appeal,
McVeigh argued the claims he made in his motion to vacate his
conviction and death sentence are weighty enough to warrant a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury in Denver convicted McVeigh on federal murder and
conspiracy charges and sentenced him to death for the 1995 bombing
of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which
killed 168 people and injured hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   In his second attempt to have his conviction and sentence thrown
out, McVeigh is claiming his lawyer, Stephen Jones, had a conflict
of interest and failed to provide adequate representation.
</P>
<P>
   He also is claiming some jurors were not honest in their answers
at jury selection for his trial and that the government suppressed
evidence involving FBI tip sheets related to the bombing case.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh is asking for an evidentiary hearing and also wants to
conduct discovery, which his lawyers called ''absolutely critical
to a full and fair development of the facts'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery would enable the defense to get information from
witnesses who have refused to talk and ''to learn what and when the
government knew about evidence collection problems at the Oklahoma
City FBI,'' the lawyers said in their reply brief, which was
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh, who is now on death row at the federal prison in Terre
Haute, Ind., filed his latest appeal in early March. The
prosecution made its request for dismissal later that month.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh lost his first appeal last year when the Supreme Court
refused to hear arguments that his trial was tainted by jury
misconduct and news reports that he confessed.

<HEADLINE> Mets 4, Marlins 1  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- If only the Mets could use Al Leiter every night.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter stopped New York's losing streak at four, allowing four
hits in seven innings and striking out nine Friday as the Mets beat
the Florida Marlins 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which had lost seven of its previous nine, improved to
6-0 this season with Leiter (3-0) on the mound. After Pat Mahomes
threw a hitless eighth, John Franco pitched a perfect ninth for his
first save since last June 24, the 417th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Following a bloop single by Mike Redmond in the second inning,
Leiter retired the next 10 batters. Four Marlins struck out, four
popped out and two grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo stopped the streak with a bunt single leading off
the sixth, although umpire Tony Randazzo missed the call.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Todd Zeile fielded the grounder and lunged toward
Castillo a few feet shy of the bag. Randazzo called him safe, but
television replays clearly showed that Zeile tagged Castillo on the
upper arm.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter walked two of the next three batters, loading the bases.
But he struck out Mike Lowell and Derrek Lee to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who pitched the first no-hitter in Marlins history,
struck out the side in the sixth and got Alex Gonzalez to foul out
to start the seventh before Redmond doubled to right center field.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second in the seventh, Leiter escaped
by fanning Mark Kotsay.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (3-1) allowed four hits and three runs in seven
innings, striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson led off the game with a walk and scored on
Edgardo Alfonzo's sacrifice fly, and Rey Ordonez made it 2-0 with
an RBI double in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond singled home a run in the bottom half, but Mike Piazza's
seventh homer made it 3-1 in the fourth. Armando Almanza walked
Robin Ventura with the bases loaded in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lowell went 0-for-4, including a bases-loaded strikeout in
the sixth inning, extended his hitless streak to 20 at-bats. ... NL
strikeout leader Preston Wilson struck out three times, giving him
47 this season. ... Leiter was the first of three left-handed
starters the Marlins will face in this series. ... The announced
crowd of 30,229 was the second-largest at Pro Player Stadium this
season.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Attempts To Try Top Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Congress has subpoenaed Mexican Tourism
Secretary Oscar Espinosa in what could be the first step toward
impeachment on corruption charges, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If removed from office, Espinosa would be stripped of his
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa, the former mayor of Mexico City, has been accused of
embezzling funds during his tenure in that office. A member of
Mexico's ruling party, he has denied the charges and called them
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the chief prosecutor for the current, opposition-led
Mexico City government accused Espinosa of having approved
transfers of $45 million to an account controlled by a senior aide,
with no evidence as to what happened to the money.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena, delivered Thursday, asks Espinosa to present
evidence in his defense to the lower house of congress. After
committee hearings, the issue will go to the floor of congress.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors cannot bring formal charges in the case until
congress votes on his removal, because all Cabinet secretaries are
allowed immunity from prosecution while in office.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow calmed
Mexican concerns Friday, saying he didn't think any Mexican
businessmen would be included on a list of drug ''kingpins'' to be
released under a new U.S. law in June.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have expressed concern about the June 1
implementation of the U.S. drug kingpin law, which will allow for
the freezing of U.S. assets of foreigners linked to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there has been a misunderstanding here. I think we
won't see businessmen on the list which is to be published,''
Davidow told reporters in Mexico City's main square following an
observance of the Cinco de Mayo holiday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Rosario Green warned ''we could
not accept the possibility that the good names and reputations of
people and businesses might be damaged'' by the list.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said Mexico is concerned that the new law
might be used to hurt Mexican businesses that compete with U.S.
firms.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Peso Hits Historic Low  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Political gridlock and rebel threats to
kidnap the rich drove the Colombian peso to a historic low on
Friday and observers said key economic reforms were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn -- coming amid stubbornly high unemployment, falling
government bond values and shrinking foreign investment -- heaps new
economic jitters atop the Andean nation's woes.
</P>
<P>
   The peso closed at 2,043 to the U.S. dollar on Friday, it's
lowest ever. The previous low was registered on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The currency has fallen 2.6 percent since April 25, the day
Colombia's largest guerrilla band announced plans to begin
abducting anyone with a net worth of one million U.S. dollars as
well as high-powered executives if they refuse to pay guerrilla
''peace taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, sent shudders through the investor community and prompted an
angry rebuke Wednesday from President Andres Pastrana, who is
engaged in slow-moving peace talks with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Pastrana hurt confidence in the economy by
proposing in March to dissolve Congress later this year though a
national anti-corruption referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In responce to a graft scandal in Congress, Pastrana's plan set
off a political firestorm that unraveled a pro-government majority
in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition legislators are demanding Cabinet resignations and
threatening to block privatization plans and tax and pension
reforms expected of Colombia in loan agreements with the powerful
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   IMF funds are a key part of a $7.5 billion plan Pastrana is
promoting to foreign donors for helping Colombia restore economic
growth, fight drug trafficking and end a 36-year leftist
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to political violence that claims an estimated 3,000
lives each year, the country is straining to emerge from its worst
economic recession since the 1930s. Official unemployment is at 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Insulate Tobacco Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Legislature approved a measure
Friday aimed at protecting tobacco companies from financial ruin
brought on by damages in a class action lawsuit by capping how much
they must pay to appeal those damages.
</P>
<P>
   The move is in an effort to preserve the flow of billions of
dollars that the companies owe Florida over the next two decades as
part of a 1997 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The state sued cigarette makers to recover money spent treating
sick smokers. Under the settlement, cigarette makers must pay the
state hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- a total estimated at
more than $13 billion over the next 25 years. The companies also
made non-economic concessions, such as restrictions on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But the money flow is dependent on the companies staying
solvent. As they face other lawsuits, cigarette makers have warned
they may face ruin. The industry has recently warned that new
lawsuits, particularly a massive class action suit brought by sick
Florida smokers, may bankrupt it.
</P>
<P>
   The class action lawsuit, being heard in Miami, is in the
punitive damages phase. The jury has already found the industry
guilty of conspiring to produce a defective product. The industry
has said the jury could award damages as high as $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill caps the bond amount the companies would have to put up
to appeal the damages at $100 million, or 10 percent of their net
worth.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was approved unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bond provision, the bill would establish a
mechanism to sell off part of the future income to investors. The
full Legislature would have to approve selling the income, however.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush said he was pleased by the bill's passage. He
originally proposed selling off the income to investors, but said
he wasn't concerned that that couldn't happen immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to act very quickly,'' Bush said. ''Right now is
not the time to be going into the market for ... selling bonds or
anything until there's some stability and understanding how some of
these court cases are going to come out.''

<HEADLINE> Royals 5, White Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Chris Fussell, banished to the minor
leagues last month with a 6.19 ERA, returned Friday night to pitch
a career-high seven innings and lead the Kansas City Royals over
the Chicago White Sox 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa had three hits and two RBIs, and Mike Sweeney doubled,
homered and drove in two runs for the Royals, who raised their home
record to a league-best 12-4. Randa has 12 RBIs in his last 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   Fussell (2-1), optioned to Triple-A Omaha on April 26, replaced
injured ace Jose Rosado, a two-time All-Star who was placed on the
15-day disabled list Friday because of tendinitis in his left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In his second major league win, his first as a starter, Fussell
allowed one run and six hits, struck out six and walked three.
Chicago stranded 10 runners.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago finished with two-hit relief.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Eldred (2-1), trying to win three consecutive starts for the
first time since 1994, allowed five runs and 10 hits in 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon doubled in the first inning -- the eighth straight
game he's led off with a hit -- and scored on Sweeney's double.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City made it 3-1 in the third on Mark Quinn's run-scoring
double and Randa's RBI single. In the fifth, Carlos Febles singled,
stole second and scored on Randa;s single.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee hit a solo home run in the second for the White Sox,
who hit five home runs on Wednesday against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney hit an 0-2 pitch for an opposite-field homer in the
seventh. Jermaine Dye then chased Eldred with his league-leading
13th double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RF Jeff Abbott made a fine catch of Dye's drive in the
first, jumping high at the fence and snaring the ball, which was
only about a foot short of flying out. ... Royals C Brian Johnson
made a poor play in the third. Jose Valentin broke from third when
Chris Singleton hit a chopper in front of the plate. But Valentin,
caught in a rundown, made it safely back to third when Johnson's
throw to Randa at third bounced at his feet in the dirt. The Royals
escaped damage when 1B Dave McCarty made an outstanding play on
Greg Norton's grounder for the third out. He was not charged with
an error.

<HEADLINE> Italian Cycling Great Bartali Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- Italian cycling great Gino Bartali, whose
victory in the 1948 Tour de France may have averted a political
insurrection at home, died Friday after a heart attack. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Bartali died at his home in Florence, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular Italian cyclists ever and a rival of the
late Fausto Coppi, Italy's other legendary champion, or
''Campionissimo,'' Bartali won the Giro D'Italia three times and
the Tour de France in 1938 and in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the nationwide enthusiasm touched off by Bartali's
victory helped ease political tensions over the shooting and
wounding of Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti.
</P>
<P>
   Several historians suggested that elation over Bartali's win
prevented an insurrection by Italian communists.
</P>
<P>
   His professional career, spanning three decades from the 1930s
to 1950s, included 170 wins in the major European classics.
However, he never won the world road title.
</P>
<P>
   ''He died serenely ... his condition had been worsening in the
last few months,'' Bartali's elder son, Andrea, told Italian media.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his widow, Adriana, two sons and a daughter.
Information on funeral arrangements was not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Appears in Public  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly a year after being hit by a car in a near
fatal accident, novelist Stephen King strode unaided to the stage
Friday night at a Manhattan night club where he made his first
public appearance since the crash.
</P>
<P>
   King rendered a spirited reading of a short story, ''L.T.'s
Theory of Pets.'' The renowned teller of scary stories -- who in
recent years has branched into different subjects to much acclaim --
was one of several writers kicking off the inaugural The New Yorker
Festival this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to be here,'' King said to about 300 people gathered
at the Bowery Ballroom. ''Actually, it's nice to be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 19, King was struck by a van while walking along the
shoulder of a road in his home state of Maine. The driver pleaded
guilty but did not receive a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   King claimed to be nervous for his self-proclaimed ''coming-out
party.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer of ''The Shining,'' ''The Green Mile'' and ''Hearts
in Atlantis'' remains hobbled, sometimes leaning upon a cane. He
spends two hours a day, three days a week, rehabilitating from the
injuries, which included broken ribs and broken bones in his right
leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not strong but I'm feeling better,'' King said in an
interview before his reading.
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience although he selected a piece that was not
published in the magazine, it sounded ''sort of like a New Yorker
story.''
</P>
<P>
   The literary and arts tribute celebrates The New Yorker's 75th
anniversary, and other celebrities, including Salman Rushdie, Alec
Baldwin, Paul Simon and Kofi Annan, are participating through the
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Wave 19, Crunch 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Michael Richardson scored three goals to power
the Milwaukee Wave past the Cleveland Crunch 19-6 to win the NPSL
Finals on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Wave became the first team in the league's 16-year history
to lose the first game of the best-of-five finals at home and
rebound to win the championship. Milwaukee, which won its first
title in 1998, kept the defending champion Crunch from winning its
fourth title in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We beat one of the greatest teams in indoor soccer history,''
Wave coach Keith Tozer said. ''I'm so proud of our team. We had the
best record in the regular season (31-13) and finished it off here
decisively.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson had a 3-point goal and a 2-pointer in an 8-0 run in
the first half to spark the Wave from a 2-0 deficit to an 11-6
halftime lead. His 2-point goal at 5:17 of the third quarter
started the Wave on another 8-0 run that sealed the victory in
front of a league playoff record crowd of 15,469.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was voted Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Marinaro, the league's six-time MVP and seven-time
scoring champion, had two 2-point goals for Cleveland. He put the
Crunch ahead 2-0 with a right-footed shot from just inside the
penalty box 4:53 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's 3-pointer at 11:34 followed by a bicycle kick goal
by Brian Loftin just 1:59 later put the Wave firmly in command.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so proud to be a part of this team,'' Richardson said.
''Winning a championship does not happen often around our city and
now we have two. It is a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland won the first game of the series in Milwaukee 20-18,
but the Wave rallied to win Game 2 at home 18-12 after trailing
12-11 late in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland rolled to a 27-15 triumph at home in Game 3, but again
the Wave came back 14-8 in Game 4.

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Phillies 5  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker squandered a three-run lead in the
top of the ninth inning, but Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer in
the bottom half to give the Atlanta Braves a 6-5 victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker relieved with a 4-1 lead, but couldn't get through the
inning. Rudy Seanez (1-0) had to get the final out, then picked up
the win when Jones homered to center field against Wayne Gomes
(1-2). Atlanta extended its home winning streak to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner led off the winning rally with a pinch-hit single
and moved to second on Quilvio Veras' sacrifice bunt. On an 0-1
pitch, Jones sent a towering, 423-foot drive over the wall in
center for his seventh homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies rallied against Rocker, who had converted his first
seven save chances since serving a two-week suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen led off with a homer to right and the crowd began to
grow restless when Mike Lieberthal and Rico Brogna followed with
back-to-back singles.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jordan made the first out on a fly ball, but Desi Relaford
worked the count to 2-0 before tripling to the right-center gap.
</P>
<P>
   Former Brave Brian Hunter struck out on a checked swing, but
Doug Glaville singled to bring home the go-ahead run, setting off a
torrent of boos from the crowd of 40,174.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker stood on the mound, hands on hips, until manager Bobby
Cox arrived to make the pitching change.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker gave up as many runs in the ninth as he had in 70 career
games at Turner Field, costing Tom Glavine his sixth win of the
year. The two-time Cy Young winner allowed only four hits and a run
in seven innings, reducing his ERA to 1.73.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were playing for the first time since their 15-game
winning streak, a modern franchi, was snapped Wednesday night by
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf also pitched seven strong innings, surrendering just
five hits and two earned runs. But the last-place Phillies dropped
to 0-4 against the Braves this season and fell 12 games back in the
NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones gave the Braves a 2-0 lead in the fifth with his
sixth homer -- and first of the year from the right side. The
following inning, Philadelphia cut the deficit in half. Ron Gant
tripled to the gap in left-center -- the only Phillies player to get
past second base against Glavine -- and scored on a groundout by
Bobby Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves restored their two-run lead in the bottom half with
an unearned run. Javy Lopez reached on a grounder that went through
the legs of Rolen at third base and moved up when Trenidad Hubbard
walked. But the Phillies botched a potential inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Speedster Rafael Furcal slipped leaving the box on a grounder to
short, but Hubbard slid hard into Jordan, whose relay throw sailed
wide of first. Lopez sprinted home from third on Philadelphia's
second error of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made it 4-1 in the eighth when Brian Jordan scored
from third on Jeff Brantley's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Phillies have struggled against a brutal schedule. Six
of their eight opponents are at .500 or better and they have played
all four NL playoff teams from 1999. ... With Weiss out, the
19-year-old Furcal becomes the full-time starter at short. While a
switch-hitter, Furcal had gotten most of his at-bats from the left
side (43 of 48) prior to going 1-for-3 Friday against the
left-handed Wolf. ... For the 10th time in franchise history, a
Braves pitcher has won his first six decisions.

of the Columbine High victims, shocking the community two weeks after the first
anniversary of the massacre. Greg Barnes, a 17-year-old who averaged 26.2 points
a game as a junior last season and had attracted attention from Harvard, Notre

O'Connor conducted countless memorials for New York heroes both famous and
obscure. The 40-minute service marked O'Connor's return to the Manhattan church
where he presided for 16 years as the nation's highest-profile Roman Catholic.
O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday night in his residence behind the cathedral after

this moment continues to fall well short of the standards that are required,''
Patrick Merloe, head of the joint mission of the National Democratic Institute

Toledo in a dead heat in the runoff race after a first-round campaign and April
9 vote riddled with irregularities and allegations of government abuses and

homes of 17 police officers Friday morning as part of its
months-long investigation into one of the worst police corruption
scandals in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   The search warrants came a day after a judge threw out six more
convictions prosecutors believe were tainted by police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 officers have been relieved of duty as a result of the
scandal in which officers at the city's Rampart station are said to
have framed scores of people for crimes they didn't commit,
sometimes beating, robbing and shooting them as well. Criminal
charges have been filed against three officers, and Police Chief
Bernard Parks has said he expects more people to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League,
condemned the searches and the manner in which they were conducted.
He said prosecutors served the warrants at about 7 a.m. and
conducted searches in front of officers' children and neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 96, SuperSonics 93  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 27 points and every
Utah starter reached double figures as the Jazz beat the Seattle
SuperSonics 96-93 on Friday night to win the first-round playoff
series 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton had 17 points and hit two free throws with nine
seconds remaining to preserve the victory. Seattle had pulled
within 94-93 when Gary Payton flipped in a runner in the lane with
25 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics got a final chance, but Chuck Person's 3-point
attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer, sending Utah to a
rematch with Portland in the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Trail Blazers eliminated the Jazz in six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz played solid on both ends as a team, bearing no
resemblance to the fractured, bickering bunch that unraveled in the
fourth quarter of Game 4 on Wednesday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Bryon Russell scored 16 points for Utah and helped limit Payton
to 27. Jeff Hornacek scored 14 for the Jazz and extended his
14-year NBA career by at least a few more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a noisy capacity crowd of 19,911 at the Delta Center,
the Jazz wore down the Sonics with a swarming defense that held
Seattle to 43 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But Utah made it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Olden Polynice gave the Sonics a final chance with 30.8 seconds
remaining when, with the Jazz trying to extend a 94-91 lead, he
missed two free throws -- shooting an airball on the second.
</P>
<P>
   Payton set the tone for Game 5 when he buried a meaningless
3-pointer at the end of Game 4. Fans booed him almost every time he
touched the ball and bated him in the closing minutes with chants
of ''Ga-ry, Ga-ry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Payton almost had the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Payton drove past Utah center Greg Ostertag, but Stockton
delivered when he was fouled on the other end. The Jazz also got an
important late basket from Hornacek, who tipped in Malone's miss
with 1:44 to play for a 94-89 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice scored 13 points, and Stockton had 15 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 79-70 going into the fourth quarter, but
Patterson and Payton combined on a 9-1 run that forced to Utah to
call a timeout with 8:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Twice more Seattle came within a point in the fourth, but Malone
kept the Sonics at bay with his turnaround jumper. Seattle's last
surge came when Payton and Rashard Lewis hit consecutive baskets to
pull within 92-89 with 2:06 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis scored 20 and Vin Baker had 17 for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz extended a 53-49 halftime lead when Jeff Hornacek
scored the first seven points of the third quarter. Payton went
1-for-5 in the period, with Russell swatting two of his layup
attempts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Utah coach Jerry Sloan passed Lenny Wilkens for fifth place
on the NBA's career list with 73 playoff victories. Sloan moved
into fifth on the list of playoffs games coached with 139, passing
K.C. Jones. ... Malone exchanged words with some courtside Sonics
fans after going after a loose ball late in the first half. One fan
appeared to hold Malone when he tried to get up. ... Payton needs
two 3-pointers to tie Sam Perkins for the franchise playoff record
of 102. ... Jazz forward Adam Keefe missed the series after
straining his right hamstring during warmups for Game 1. He sat on
the bench for Game 5, wearing a business suit.

<HEADLINE> 14 Cuban Migrants Rescued  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Fourteen Cuban immigrants adrift at sea
for 10 days and suffering from severe dehydration were rescued by
the Coast Guard and taken to hospitals Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 men and two women were aboard a rickety boat about seven
miles offshore northeast of Miami when they were rescued by the
Coast Guard, which was notified by a passing freighter. Eight were
unconscious when the Coast Guard arrived, according to Petty
Officer Danielle DeMarino.
</P>
<P>
   Eight men and woman were in stable condition. Four men and a
woman were in serious condition late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans told the Coast Guard they had been adrift for 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   Under current U.S. immigration policy, Cuban refugees who reach
land usually are allowed to remain in the country. Those
intercepted before setting foot on U.S. soil usually are returned
to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Expos 10, Brewers 2  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero hit a three-run homer and
Rondell White nearly hit the ball out of County Stadium as the
Montreal Expos scored all their runs in the first two innings of a
10-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored five runs in the first and five more in the
second against Jason Bere (2-3), who was down 10-0 before getting
the first out of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   White and Chris Widger homered in the first, while Guerrero's
three-run shot, his ninth of the year, highlighted the second.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero went 4-for-5 to improve to .625 (10-for-16) with 10
RBIs in four games against Milwaukee this year.
</P>
<P>
   White's homer was a 435-foot solo shot that clanged off the
metal bleachers in left field only two or three rows from the top.
Cecil Fielder is the only player ever to clear the bleachers in 47
years of baseball at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro had a two-run double in the first, and White drove in
another run with a second-inning single. Widger's homer was a
400-foot, two-run shot slightly to the left of White's blast.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez (3-0) allowed five hits and struck out eight over
seven innings in a smooth performance. He had already batted twice
and scored a run before Brewers cleanup hitter Geoff Jenkins got
his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has lost 14 of its last 18 games and is 2-6 on a
10-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Bere, who allowed 11 hits, nine earned runs and three walks, has
lost three of his last four starts. He was left in because the
Brewers bullpen has been overused during the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos allowed a franchise-record 43 runs while being swept
in a just-completed three-game series at Coors Field. But it was
Montreal's bats doing all the damage in County Stadium, where
Brewers have allowed 47 runs in the eight games of their homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored in the third on an RBI single by Mark Loretta.
He missed the Brewers' previous three games with a pulled
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers added a run in the ninth when Luis Lopez struck out
with two outs and the bases loaded, but reached on Ugueth Urbina's
wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jenkins lost control of his bat while swinging in the
second inning, and the flying lumber hit a fan behind home plate.
After paramedics examined her, the fan left the building with a
splint on her arm. Before his next at-bat, Jenkins was removed for
a pinch-hitter. The Brewers said he sprained a finger on his right
hand. ... The Expos said reliever Graeme Lloyd will be out 3-4
months after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery in Los
Angeles on Friday. ... John Snyder threw six shutout innings and
allowed two hits for the Brewers' Double-A affiliate in Huntsville
in his first start of a 30-day rehab assignment. Snyder, acquired
from the White Sox in the offseason, suffered strained muscles in
his ribcage and stomach during spring training.

<HEADLINE> Big Game Jackpot Swells to $230M  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans lined up at convenience stores and
joined office pools for a shot at instant riches as the jackpot in
Friday night's Big Game drawing swelled to $230 million -- the
second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say money can't buy happiness, but I'm willing to try,''
said Kevin Stoerch of Escanaba, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Many players bought dozens and even hundreds of $1 tickets,
apparently pooling their money with co-workers or simply trying to
improve the odds. The odds of getting all six winning numbers were
one in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's winning numbers were: 6-8-16-30-32 and Big Money Ball
26.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials were expected to announce whether anyone won
the grand prize early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-state Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia. The
jackpot swelled from $5 million to $230 million after going eight
weeks without a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be happy with $5 million,'' said Robert Trasak, a
36-year-old delivery driver and occasional lottery player who
bought 20 tickets at a Detroit gas station as the jackpot climbed
higher and higher. ''But something about $220 million makes you
say, 'I really got to win that one.'''
</P>
<P>
   People from North Carolina streamed into Charley's Stop and Shop
in Danville, Va., to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been terrible today,'' said clerk Kaye Dicks, who saw the
line grow to more than 50. ''They've had their hands full of
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pilot Travel Center near the Alabama state line, a line
of 40 ticket buyers stretched out the door and around the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just playing because it's so high,'' said Lisa Gray of
Alpine, Ala., who drove 40 miles to stand in line with her
4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The winner can take the money in 26 annual installments of $8.8
million before taxes, or receive a lump sum of roughly $114
million. Federal and state taxes would reduce that to roughly $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest jackpot in U.S. history is $295.7 million, won by a
group of 13 machinists from Westerville, Ohio, in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Millions plunking down $1 -- or more -- for a shot at riches  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Millions of Americans lined up at convenience
stores, drove across state lines and joined office pools for a shot
at instant riches as the jackpot in Friday night's Big Game drawing
swelled to $230 million -- the second-largest prize in American
lottery history.
</P>
<P>
   And many were plunking down more than $1, trying to increase the
odds of winning by buying tickets in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're buying $150, $200 up to $300 worth of tickets,'' said
John Bodie, who operates an Augusta convenience store just over the
Savannah River from South Carolina. ''The majority of the big ones
like that are office pools.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina residents were streaming into Charley's Stop and
Shop in Danville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been terrible today,'' said clerk Kaye Dicks, who saw the
line grow to more than 50 at times. One customer bought $1,000 in
tickets and several others spent several hundred dollars. ''They've
had their hands full of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of getting all five numbers and the money ball are one
in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's winning numbers are: 6-8-16-30-32 and Big Money Ball
26.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials planned to announce whether anyone won the
grand prize early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the estimated $230 million jackpot, one winner would take
home a lump sum of $75 million, based on the Georgia state tax of 6
percent and 28 percent federal taxes. Georgians choosing the
annuity option would take home about $5.8 million per year for 26
years after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Although it didn't approach the record $295.7 million jackpot,
it was a record for the seven-state Big Game played in Georgia,
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pilot Travel Center just across the Alabama-Georgia state
line, a line of 40 ticket buyers stretched out the door and around
the building Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we sold $26,000 Thursday, when typically we sell about
$1,000 to $2,000 a day,'' said travel center manager Rick Ekman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just playing because it's so high,'' said Lisa Gray of
Alpine, Ala., standing in a line with her 4-year-old son, Nathan.
She drove 40 miles to buy a ticket. ''I think it's good. It gives
everybody a little chance to better themselves and it don't cost a
whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois towns along the Mississippi River have seen heavy
traffic from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have one machine and it's hot,'' said Jackie Nelson at the
Beverage Mart in Gulfport, Ill. She said 95 percent of her lottery
customers are Iowans, who can play Powerball, but must cross the
river to play the Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   The small liquor store and tavern sold five times the normal
amount of tickets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Escanaba, Mich., resident Kevin Stoerch got in on the Big Game
with thoughts of winning the jackpot on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I won, I'd buy my own business and take care of my
family,'' he said. ''I'd try to make myself happy. They say money
can't buy happiness, but I'm willing to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Trasak, 36, a delivery driver, said he occasionally plays
the lottery when the jackpots are lower, but he buys extra tickets
when the jackpots grow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your chances are the same whether it's high or low, I guess,''
Trasak said Friday while buying 20 tickets at a Detroit gas
station. ''I'd be happy with $5 million, but something about $220
million makes you say, 'I really got to win that one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Millard Anderson, 81, of Sylacauga, Ala., said he plays
regularly and invested $5 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like I'm going to win, but I hope I do,'' he
said. ''It would be quite a job to find out what you're going to do
with it.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Red Wings 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Peter Forsberg's scoring streak was too much for
the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg scored his fifth goal of the playoffs -- and fourth
game-winner -- as the Colorado Avalanche eliminated the Red Wings
from the NHL playoffs with a 4-2 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second straight year Colorado ousted its archrival
in the second round. Colorado won the best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinal series 4-1 and advanced to the conference
finals against either Dallas or San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg's goal at 4:40 of the third period gave the Avalanche a
3-1 lead. Barely a minute later, Detroit's Brendan Shanahan made it
3-2, but Colorado's fourth line produced an insurance goal as Shjon
Podein scored on a rebound at 9:01.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Patrick Roy, extending his NHL record for playoff
victories to 118, had 20 saves. Chris Osgood had 21 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team mounted any serious scoring threats in a tentative
first period that saw Colorado outshoot Detroit 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit went 0-for-2 on the power play, and Colorado was
0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood was penalized for slashing midway through the period, and
during that advantage Colorado got off three shots, including a
hard shot by Chris Drury.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings lost forward Darren McCarty for part of the period
after he was run into the boards by Greg de Vries and had to be
assisted from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Joe Sakic and Stephane Yelle scored in the second
period, and Detroit's Larry Murphy countered with a short-handed
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Deadmarsh, beating Steve Yzerman on a faceoff in the
Detroit end, got the puck to Sakic, who scored a power-play goal on
a wrist shot from just outside the right circle at 2:46. The goal
came only eight seconds after Nicklas Lidstrom went off for
tripping and was Sakic's 100th career playoff point.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the period, Osgood made a sprawling save to rob Sakic
from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:01, Aaron Miller launched a long shot from beyond the
right circle, and Yelle tapped in the rebound for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Colorado threatened to pad its lead when Shanahan
was penalized for high-sticking. But Murphy took a pass from Igor
Larionov and beat Roy from close range. Murphy's short-handed goal
was his 150th career playoff point.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg's 40-foot rocket sailed over Osgood's left shoulder
early in the final period. Shanahan scored from the slot after a
deflection at 6:13.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Eric Messier kept a play alive by beating
Lidstrom to the puck to prevent an icing call, then got the puck to
rookie Serge Aubin. Aubin's shot from the left circle rebounded out
front, where Podein tipped it in.

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes Down Contribution Law  </HEADLINE>
By R. UNRUH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Friday struck down a
federal law limiting how much political parties can spend to back
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stems
from a case that began when Tim Wirth announced his candidacy as a
Democrat for the open Colorado Senate seat in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee spent $15,000
on radio ads criticizing Wirth's voting record, and then in its
quarterly report to the commission classified it as an operating
expense instead of an expense coordinated with a party candidate in
a political race.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats complained and the commission ruled the GOP's
purchase of radio time was connected to the Senate campaign and
filed a lawsuit against the Colorado Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The case originally was decided in favor of the commission, but
in 1996, the Supreme Court returned the case to the district court,
concluding that the Colorado Republican Party's freedom of
expression was violated when the party was cited for exceeding
federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The district court later found for the GOP, and Friday's opinion
from the appellate justices concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''We conclude that the Party Expenditure Provision constitutes a
'significant interference' with the First Amendment rights of
political parties,'' the opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court generally has upheld the federal contribution
limits as well as ''coordinated expenditures'' by national and
state political parties. That's because of the possibility, or
perception, of improper influence coming from large donations.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the anti-Wirth advertisement was developed and
approved by the Colorado Republican Party ''independent of any
candidate for Federal office,'' the court said.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Protesters Halt Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Yankees-Orioles game was interrupted briefly
Friday night when eight protesters angered by the arrest of
protesters on Vieques Island near Puerto Rico ran onto the field at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the top of the fifth inning, the protesters
simultaneously jumped onto the field from behind home plate, down
the left-field line and right-field lines and waved Puerto Rican
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards ran out and tackled them and escorted them from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   One of the protesters ran to Yankees center fielder Bernie
Williams -- a native of Puerto Rico -- and tried to hand him an
unidentified object.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what they were trying to do,'' Williams said. ''I
certainly understand their situation and feel for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees left fielder Ricky Ledee and catcher Jorge Posada also
are Puerto Rican.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked up and saw a lot of Puerto Rican flags,'' Posada
said. ''I know nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican protesters had occupied the Navy's 60-year-old
Atlantic fleet training range in April 1999 after a civilian Navy
guard was killed in an accidental bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the military presence on Vieques maintain that the
military is responsible for environmental degradation, abnormally
high rates of cancer and other illnesses among the island's 9,300
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy argues Vieques is vital to national security because it
is the only place that air, land and sea forces can train
simultaneously with live munitions before deploying abroad.
