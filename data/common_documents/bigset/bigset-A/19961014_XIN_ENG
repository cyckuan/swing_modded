<P>
GENEVA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's Johan Museeuw Sunday
won the men's road race at the world cycling championships after
beating Switzerland's Mauro Gianetti in Lugano, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Museeuw covered the 252 kilometer course in six hours, 23
minutes 49 seconds to celebrate his 31st birthday win. Gianetti
was just one second behind.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Michele Bartoli outsprinted another Belgian, Axel
Merckx, to take the bronze medal with 29 seconds behind Museeuw.
</P>
<P>
The race was reduced to a two man contest when Museeuw and
Gianetti rocketed away from the lead group of 12 riders on the
first climb of the 14th lap. They built a 56 second lead as the
pack behind them slowly dissolved.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Museeuw 23rd men's road race title. The
Belgium's cyclist currently leads the World Cup standings.

BONN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Swiss 16-year-old Martina Hingis
won her first WTA tournament Sunday by edging Germany's Anke Huber
6-2, 3-6, 6-3 in the Filderstadt final.

challenge of fifth-seeded Huber. And the win is expected to lift
Hingis to ninth in the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
Huber, winner of the WTA tournament in Leipzig last Sunday,
was heartbroken to miss out on the Porsche.
</P>
<P>
"Things just didn't go for me as well today as they had been
going recently," she was quoted as saying. "It is a bitter
disappointment to see this car and not be able to climb into it."

</P>
<P>
-- As Japan gears up for a national election on October 20,
many people, especially those in small towns, are preparing to
vote for reasons that have little to do with the candidates'
policies and personalities.
</P>
<P>
-- The race for control of the U.S. House of Representatives is
showing signs that Democrats' chance are improving.
</P>
<P>
-- Breaking with their counterparts from FBI, some senior U.S.

<HEADLINE> Marseilleurs Vote in By-Election With Indifference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The people in Gardanne, a town
outside Marseille and the most representative of the 10th
constituency of the department of Bouches-du-Rhone, today cast
their vote in a legislative by-election with an attitude of
indifference.
</P>
<P>
The turnout rate of the town until noon was 18.83 percent in
the poll, which would produce a member of National Assembly to
replace Bernard Tapie, who was stripped of his parliamentarian
seat over a series of financial scandals.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) reported that most of the people of
this working class quarter of Bigger Marseille had a feeling of
disillusionment caused by the fall of Tapie, the former boss of
the Marseille Olympic soccer team, who was elected with 44.48
percent of votes in 1993 in the constituency.
</P>
<P>
Four out of 13 candidates are considered to be leading in the
poll. They are the town's Communist mayor Roger Mei, former
health minister Bernard Kouchner from the Radical Socialist Party,
Damien Bariller from the far-right National Front (FN), and Herve
Fabre-Aubrespy from the ruling party of Rassemblement pour la
Republique.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever of the candidate is elected will move on to Paris, and
here, nothing will change," AFP quoted one among a group of local
inhabitants, who were chatting about Saturday night's soccer match
under the sunshine in a marketplace, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked about their opinion about the Communist mayor Mei, one of
them said: "Yes, we know him; we respect him. He is nice, but
what can he do with his ticket in his hand in parliament?"
</P>
<P>
But they said that they don't trust the "Parisian" Kouchner,
because he could be just like Tapie who appeared for 15 days to
get the votes and then disappeared forever.
</P>
<P>
All of them showed a distaste for the National Front candidate
Bariller. "As long as one does not see the FN come here, it will
be all right," AFP quoted a woman among the group as saying.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Peace Talks Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks due to be held Monday was postponed for a day at
the request of U.S. envoy Dennis Ross who tried to bridge the
wide gap.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israeli and Palestinian sides have accepted Ross'
proposal on the delay which was aimed at patching the existing
deep differences between them. Ross was quoted by Israel Radio as
saying that it was worthwhile waiting for a day in order to create
a better basis for progress in the renewed talks in Taba, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister David
Levy met with Israeli negotiators to the talks to review the
past week of negotiations and discuss the future talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel insisted that the past week of talks have made
progress while the Palestinian side denied any headway. The
first stumbling obstacle remained the issue of Israeli troop
redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding making changes in security arrangements
while implementing the signed agreement, but was rejected by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting in Nablus with Israeli opposition
Labor party leader and former premier Shimon Peres, Palestinian
Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat once again denied that any
progress had been made in the past week of talks.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to make real efforts to ensure the accurate
implementation of the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"I hope, and I am addressing the whole Israeli people to be
faithful to what we have agreed upon and what has been
signed ... to work together to push forward the peace process,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a chief architect of the peace process, said he did not
hold the meeting on behalf of the government, nor did he come to
criticize the government. He said the peace process had not yet
died and the current difficulties should not be viewed as "the
end of the road."
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to travel to Jordan Monday to brief King Hussein on
the current situation of the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifai met today with
Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Dore Gold to discuss bilateral
ties that are soured by Jordan's recent harsh verbal attacks on
Israel's hardline policies. Rifai urged Israel to honor the
signed agreements by implementing them.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu intended to
reach an agreement on Hebron redeployment by November before
U.S. general elections. He is apparently trying to avoid the
unwanted pressure from the new U.S. government, which could put
Israel in an unfavorable position.
</P>
<P>
The current talks resumed early last week under the direct
mediation of U.S. President Bill Clinton, who convened a summit
between Netanyahu and Arafat and King Hussein earlier this month
in wake of the Israeli-Palestinian bloody clashes that killed 75
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Airways, Greece's state
air carrier, is planning a series of worldwide alliances and
partnerships aiming at reducing costs in long-distance flights and

The partnerships will take several forms: The airlines may
merge some flights or merge their reservations systems or their
ground handling services.
</P>
<P>
According to Olympic's senior manager Iordanis Karatzas, the

heavily concentrated on Europe and weak in other parts of the
world.

Olympic has already signed an agreement with Bulgaria's Balkan
Airlines to open the Salonika-Sofia-Moscow and Athens-Tunis
routes. These flights will be available in November.
</P>

with Indian Airlines, talks with Indonesian air carrier Garuda
Airlines are in their final stages.
</P>
<P>
On the Far East front, Olympic has entered into discussions
with Asiana, South Korea's second largest airline, and EVA,
Taiwan's second largest airline.
</P>
<P>
In order to better serve the gulf states and to increase its
passenger load to and from Australia, Olympic will start another
Melbourne-Sydney service via Dubai.
</P>
<P>
Olympic has also planned discussions with South Africa's SAA,
while talks have already begun with Air Seychelles on an Athens-
Nairobi-Seychelles route.
</P>
<P>
Possible north American partners include Delta and Continental,
while TWA and American Airlines have also shown interest.
</P>
<P>
In western Europe, agreements with Swissair for the Athens-
Zurich and Athens-Geneva routes, and British Midland are expected
very soon, while talks with Lufthansa and Austrian airlines are
underway.
</P>
<P>
Olympic will become more active in eastern Europe, with flights
to Prague and Budapest. It is also discussing possible agreements
with Hungary's Malev and Ukraine's Aerosuid.

<P>
PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- France will issue on October 29 a
new 200-franc bill with the picture of Gustave Eiffel printed on
it, according to an announcement in the official bulletin
"Journal".
</P>
<P>
The new bill, whose issuing was decided by the Bank of France,
is to commemorate the builder of the Eiffel Tower, the Observatory
of Nice and a number of other metallic monuments, said the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
France already has a 200-franc bill, which has the picture of

The old bill will continue to circulate side by side with the
new bill, said the announcement.

The face of the bill will have a portrait of the architect,
with the Eiffel Tower and the Observatory of Nice in the
background. The back of the bill is the picture of Eiffel standing
at the Champ de Mars which was taken at the time of the 1889
Universal Fair in Paris.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the French central bank also issued a
50-franc bill with a picture of the writer Antoine de
Saint-Exupery, and a 500-franc bill with that of scientist Pierre
et Marie Curie.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuwait Looks Forward to Practical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is witnessing
intense consultations for forming a new cabinet under the
premiership of Crown Prince Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, amidst high
expectitions of the Kuwaits for a more practical government
concerned more about economic issues and people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said today that the crown prince
accepted the appointment by an Amiri decree Saturday to head the
new government after he got full answering to his request that
several important issues be resolved first.
</P>
<P>
Evidence showed that the Kuwaiti people want to see the 17th
cabinet since independence to be concentrating on issues more
directly linked with the concerns of the people. Besides, the
sources said those who will be included in the new cabinet are
requested to realize that effective political, administrative and
 economic reforms are necessary in Kuwait for its security and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said soon after the Amiri decree was issued
that official consultations on the formation of the new cabinet
were intensified. A large number of names, including a number of
former cabinet ministers, were reviewed, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
However, only those who are able to live up to the people's
desire and aspirations may have the chances to be selected, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls conducted before the legislative
elections, Kuwaiti people demanded that the current state budget
deficit, which is at around 1.51 billion Kuwait dinars (4.98
billion U.S. dollars), be balanced before the end of this century
without cutting the salaries of Kuwaiti citizens.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is also facing a potential unemployment rate of 30
percent as tens of thousands of Kuwaiti youths are coming to the
age of joining the labor force while the private sectors prefer
to hire cheap foreign laborers rather than to employ Kuwaitis who
used to work with high wages in governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
Several former speakers of previous parliaments, when received
by the Kuwaiti Amir earlier, emphasized that the next government
should be able to assume its authorities promptly in carrying out
decisions concerning important matters of state interest.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the Kuwaiti authorities decided
to select only qualified persons to be included in the cabinet,
regardless of their family background. The same principle will
also apply to selecting members of parliament for the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwaiti constitution, at least one member of
parliament must be included in the cabinet while the maximum
number of the cabinet must not exceed one third of the number of
the 50-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The previous 16-member cabinet included five elected
parliamentary members. The former cabinet resigned last Tuesday
in accordance with the constitution in the wake of the country's
parliamentary elections. The new government should be formed
before the new parliament holds its first session on October 20th.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here predicted that a new government which has
clearly defined programs and is flexible enough to deal with any
situation under complex circumstances may come to power in
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein said here
today that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will pay a one-day
visit to Jordan Monday to discuss with him the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The king made the announcement at the airport upon his return
home after visiting the United States and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Israeli President Ezer Weizman will
visit Jordan soon, but did not name a date.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the Israeli president is likely to
make his first visit to Jordan in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's visit, the first by an Israeli president, will be a
right forum for Jordan to press Israel to go forward in the peace
process, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the Washington summit which was called by U.S. President
Bill Clinton and attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Arafat and King Hussein in order to invigorate the
stalled Middle East peace talks, the king told reporters that he
believed his participation in the summit was "worthwhile."
</P>
<P>
He added that the invitation to the meeting was "at the right
time," saying that the meeting was an "opportunity for a candid
and responsible discussion" at one of the most critical phases of
the region.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,
which resumed last Sunday at the Erez crossing between Israel and
the Gaza Strip, will achieve good results.

refugees from Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, most of them women and children, were fleeing to
another refugee camp in Kagunga, about 12 kilometers from Runingo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the men in the refugee camp scattered and tried to
hide in and around the camp, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Uvira region, where live 200,000 Hutu refugees, has been
shaken by violent fightings between Zairean troops and ethnic
Tutsi Banyamurenge militias for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
The Banyamurenges are originally from Rwanda but have lived in
eastern Zaire's mountainous region for generations.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has declared the eastern province of
Sud-Kivu a war zone following the month-long clashes.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many people have been killed in the
fightings.

<HEADLINE> International Herald Tribune to Quit Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The prestigious English language
daily International Herald Tribune is considering to quit Paris
because it cannot stand the fabulous expenses in the metropolis,
said the newspaper's chief editor Michael Getler today.
</P>
<P>
The council of administration of the newspaper asked for a
feasibility study several months ago on the possible re-deployment
of the newspaper in the United States, said Getler.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to leave. But Paris is an expensive place," he
said, adding that the newspaper is examining everything possible
to maintain its financial health and to develop.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the chances that the newspaper, which has
been settled in France for one century, will quit completely are
small, but said that "the departments could leave, editorial and
administrative, or even both."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1887, the newspaper which employs a staff of 250,
has its headquarters in Neuilly-sur-Seine in western Paris and is
run by two major American newspapers -- New York Times and
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to live for 110 more years, we should guarantee
the financial health of the daily," said Getler.

<HEADLINE> Expert Suggests Tight Regulations to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti psychology
expert today called for tightening divorce regulations and
changing preconceived social ideas to reduce divorce cases in the
country where almost one out of every three marriages ends in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fatima Ayad, a Kuwaiti University psychology teaching
board member, told the Kuwait News Agency in an exclusive
interview today that so far "divorce cases exceeded 33 percent in
Kuwait and were on the rise."
</P>
<P>
Ayad said "what facilitates divorce is the easiness of its
procedures, as many people say that divorce costs only three
dinars (9.9 U.S. dollars)."
</P>
<P>
Sociopsychologists attribute the high rate of divorces to
several reasons such as the lack of personal responsibilities,
less proper communications between couples, wrong ideas conveyed
by some television programs, less school education about
responsibilities of adults, sexual reasons and interference of
relatives.
</P>
<P>
They are also of the opinion that the Kuwaiti society has
experienced economic and technical changes in the past two or
three decades, which have caused alterations in social and
educational establishments.
</P>
<P>
The fast change caused a bit of a shock to the Kuwaiti society
which has affected couples' abilities to find their "right match"
for marriage, they said.
</P>
<P>
Ayad suggested that ways of reducing divorce cases should
include tighter divorce regulations, especially for early
marriage cases.
</P>
<P>
Besides, she proposed the formation of a committee grouping
experts from the Ministries of Justice, Social Affairs and Awqaf
(Religious Endowment) to formulate new laws and procedures aimed
at limiting divorce cases and preventing their related causes.
</P>
<P>
She also appealed to the parliament for forming a special
committee for women affairs, the prime aim of which is to revise
laws on women's rights.
</P>
<P>
Divorced women in Kuwait as an Islamic society tend to face
more problems than men as they have to overcome the obstacles
that have arisen from their divorces.
</P>
<P>
In addition to an increase of divorced women in Kuwait,
bachelors constitute a serious social problem which needs to be
checked.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists warned that by the year 2000, the occurrence of
family and social destruction will be phenomenal if the current
trend is not controlled.
</P>
<P>
Ayad, a specialist in clinical psychology, said that the
dangers and repercussions of divorce cases were not only on the
couple but also extended to children who will carry its burden
and could even suffer the same fate.
</P>
<P>
"Scientific researches proved that the rate of divorce cases
among people with divorce history in their families was higher
than the rate among people who grew in a healthy family
atmosphere," she said.

ANKARA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan was re-elected chairman of the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) at the 5th RP Grand Congress which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was re-elected by 956 out of 1,254 delegates
participating in the congress.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the congress, Erbakan expressed the RP's
support for secularism, democracy, the armed forces and
privatization, trying to erase the party's past radical image.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to include younger party members, the RP congress
decided to expand the Central Executive Board to 50 members and
the Chairmanship Board to 16.
</P>
<P>
He said that terrorism in the southeastern provinces would be
promptly ended by "our heroic army" and that emergency rule
would be gradually lifted in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erbakan promised big changes in the upcoming
budget, which he said would be balanced.
</P>
<P>
He also envisaged higher pay rise of civil servants than the
inflation rate, priority on education, health, justice and
security, and increased spending on research-and-development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan pointed out that Turkey's relations with the European
Union and the United States would be stepped up and importance
would be given to the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization
countries.

TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government forces killed
hundreds of anti-government Taliban militiamen and captured 400
others during the liberation of the militia-controlled town
Charikar, according to the Afghan Embassy in Iran today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the embassy said that Taliban militants
were inflicted heavy losses by the government forces while
retreating from Jangal Bagh to Pol-E Matak district in the east
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A group of Taliban militia had also been trapped during its
retreat, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the government forces have cleansed some eastern
areas controlled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The government forces claimed that they had taken several
Pakistani nationals captives during their clashes with the
Taliban, said the statement. But no confirmation from the
Pakistani side was reported.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said that the Afghan government forces have now
liberated from the Taliban the key towns of Jabal-Os-Seraj and
Charikar in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, which came into being in late 1994 and
held areas in the east and southeast of the country, brought the
Afghan capital of Kabul under its full control on September 28,
after it announced that it was setting up an Islamic state.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President to Visit Egypt for Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
will arrive here Monday for talks with his Egyptian counterpart
Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes at a time when the renewed Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks have so far failed to achieve tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today that he hoped
Weizman could influence Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to change his hardline policy toward Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has acted as a mediator between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, has repeatedly urged Israel to honor all the
agreements already signed with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, has been seeking to make amendments to the
agreement on a redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron, the last
West Bank town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials who are attending the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, which resumed at the Erez
Checkpoint between the Gaza Strip and Israel last Sunday, said
that they rejected Israel's demand to alter the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hope that Weizman's Cairo visit will promote
negotiations on all tracks especially after the failure of the
Washington summit attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Yasser Arafat and
Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Netanyahu and Arafat failed to agree on any
outstanding issues between Israel and the PA, including Israel's
long-delayed withdrawal from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The current Palestinian-Israeli talks, which were scheduled to
move to Egypt's resort town of Taba Monday, will be postponed for
one day.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Israel, U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross called for putting off the negotiations
to give mediators of the talks more time to bridge the gap
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will alternate between Taba and the nearby
Israeli vacation spot of Eilat.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, Oct 13 (Xinhua) - The first group of the 5,000 U.S.
troops assigned to cover a withdrawal of American peacekeeping
forces from Bosnia arrived in Croatia Sunday, local press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 510-strong advance party crossed into Croatia from Hungary
and was scheduled to cross a pontoon bridge over the Sava River
from Croatian town of Zupanja to the north-eastern part of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Further units of the second brigade of the 1st infantry
division, which is based in Germany, will arrive over the next six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The declared task of the brigade is to support the withdrawal
of the 15,000-strong 1st armored division, which has been
stationed in Bosnia for almost one year and should be pulled out
by early next year, as insisted by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials admit privately that in order to prevent the
resumption of the war, part of the Nato peace-keeping force, of
which the American troops form the backbone, has to stay behind
next year, and the second bridge could possibly be turned into the
"follow-up" force.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav FM Says Outer Wall of Sanctions Does Not Exist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Milan Milutinovic said Sunday the so-called "outer wall" of
sanctions against Yugoslavia does not exist in the country.
</P>
<P>
The outer wall of sanctions was "an empty phrase and a way of
exerting political pressure" rather than something that prevented
the country from strengthening economic, diplomatic and other
relations with the world, Milutinovic said in an interview with
Radio Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council lifted the sanctions against
Yugoslavia on October 1 under the Dayton agreement. But the West
says they would remain the "outer wall" of sanctions that continue
to block its membership of the U.N. General Assembly and financial
institutions like the World Bank unless Yugoslavia meets other
conditions such as human rights in its southern province of Kosovo
and privatization in economy.
</P>
<P>
"Those who say that all sanctions have not been lifted are
lying. They (sanctions) do not exist. We have diplomatic relations
with 163 countries in the world, we have signed or ratified more
than 150 agreements with the world over the past year, so there
could be no mention of the outer wall of sanctions. I do not see
it that way," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
But many economists and even some government officials in
Belgrade say there does exist the outer wall of sanctions against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We did everything to establish and develop cooperation with
the world. Now we expect the world to make a small step and
eliminate the outer wall of sanctions and stop discrimination
against our economy on the international market," Yugoslav Trade
Minister Djordje Siradovic said the next day after the sanctions
was lifted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about priority in the foreign policy, Milutinovic said
the most urgent task was the full normalization of relations with
Yugoslavia's neighbors -- Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia -- now
that the U.N. sanctions against the country have been lifted.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has established diplomatic relations with the
above-mentioned three republics of the former Yugoslavia over the
past six months. Only Slovenia has yet to have mutual recognition
with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said another priority was the full nomalization of
relations with the European Union and the reviving of all
agreements Yugoslavia had reached with it.
</P>
<P>
It was Yugoslavia's goal to attract as many foreign investors
as possible, to realize as many joint investments as possible and
to start its economic development through higher output and
exports, because all obstacles to it had been removed, said the
foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Politician: Yugoslav-US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Dusan Mihajlovic, President of
Serbian political party New Democracy, said here Sunday he was
certain most problems in bilateral relations between the United
States and Yugoslavia would be resolved by the end of this year or
by early 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We had very serious and open talks at the most important
institutions of the U.S. administration -- the State Department,
the National Security Council, and the Foreign Affairs Committee
of the House of Representatives," Mihajlovic told a press
conference on his return from a working visit to Washington,
adding normalization of diplomatic relations could happen soon.
</P>
<P>
New Democracy is a coalition partner of the ruling Socialist
Party of Serbia in the Serbian government and also at the upcoming
elections for Federal parliament on November 3.
</P>
<P>
Mihajlovic said he had told U.S. officials that the
normalization of bilateral relations and Yugoslavia's return to
the international community would have a positive effect on the
further democratization of economic and political life in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has accepted Yugoslavia as an equal partner
in the implementation of U.S. and international interests in this
area," he said, adding leading political and economic officials in
the United States were interested in cooperation with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said he had discussed with American officials the most
sensitive issues in the political and economic areas in Yugoslavia
as well as issues in international relations.

SARAJEVO, October 13 (Xinhua) - About 600 soldiers of the 1st
American armored division have left Bosnia since Wednesday, U.S.
officials said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The lastest units to withdraw of the 15,000-strong American

Sunday for Hungary via Croatia.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. officials believed that massive withdrawal of U.S.
troops can not be expected until after Bosnia local elections in
late November.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 5,000 troops are arriving in Bosnia to support
the withdrawal of 1st division and could be turned into part of the
follow-up force to the Nato-led multi-national peace-keeping force
in Bosnia. enditem

<HEADLINE> Afghan Ex-Gov't Troops Retake Key Areas from Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The ousted Afghan government
troops today recaptured two key areas in northern Afghanistan from
the Taliban's hand, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the government troops led by Ahmad Shah
Masood seized the lower Salang Valley, 120 kilometers north of
Kabul, in the daytime, and reclaimed Charikar, capital of Parwan
province which is 65 kilometers north of Kabul, at night.
</P>
<P>
Masood's troops Saturday captured the strategic town of Jabal
Saraj, about 77 kilometers north of Kabul, cutting off the
retreating route of a contingent of Taliban Militia who had
already entered the Salang Valley.
</P>
<P>
Masood's men attacked the Taliban in the Valley from side and
rear, routing the Taliban fighters who had no way to flee as the
Afghan Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum stationed in the upper
Salang Valley.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Taliban forces in Charikar failed to stop the
high-morale troops loyal to Masood, and had to retreat southwards.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which had captured Kabul on September 27, have
suffered several heavy losses to the ousted government troops in
northern Afghanistan since October 9 when Masood's men launched a
massive counter offensive.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the recent establishment of the
anti-Taliban alliance including Dostum, Masood and Hezb-i-Wahdat
(Khalili group) has changed the balance of power in the country.

<HEADLINE> Healthy Cities Vital to Better Life of Urban Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Efforts by individuals,
households, communities and governments need to be mustered in
order to create a healthy living environment for urban populations
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
This opinion was shared by health experts and government
officials in charge of public health work, who are attending the
Beijing International Conference on Healthy Cities, which opened
today.
</P>
<P>
The Healthy City project was initiated by the World Health
Organization (WHO), in an aim to help individual households,
community organizations and municipal governments cope more
effectively with increasingly complex health and environment
problems.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO's definition, a healthy city should provide a
sanitary environment and safe food and drinking water to urban
dwellers. Their demand for housing, income and employment also
should be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
In such a city, an improved public health service can lead to
longer and healthier lives of urban people.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 cities around the world have been involved in
this project.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our experience, it is clear that health protection
and health promotion actions are required 'beyond the health
sector' to resolve priority health problems effectively," said
Dr. S.T. Han, Regional Director of Western Pacific Region, WHO.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a number of sectors, such as urban
planning, construction, environment, labor, social affairs, and
police and fire protection services, have been involved in the
planning and implementation of Healthy City activities in China
and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Some large Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai,
Chongqing, Haikou and Shenzhen, have been carrying out
comprehensive plans for the Healthy City project.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, a similar campaign to improve sanitary
conditions in urban areas was implemented nationwide for six years.
</P>
<P>
"All these efforts will help the Chinese government and people
be more clearly aware of the importance of a healthy environment
in urban areas," said Chen Minzhang, minister of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has hosted an international
symposium on the Healthy City project.
</P>
<P>
More than 180 experts and officials from 28 countries and
regions, including Japan, the United States, Spain, Sweden, Viet
Nam, Singapore and Hong Kong, are attending the three-day event.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank has issued
a circular calling for enhanced supervision of overseas
China-funded financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The domestic investors in such institutions must set up a
special department and assign sufficient manpower to be

<HEADLINE> France Retorts U.S. Accusation of Its African Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- France today retorted the
accusation by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that
Paris regards Africa as "a private game preserve".
</P>
<P>
In reference to the U.S. policy in the Middle East, French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said, "We have
never considered the African continent as a private game preserve
of France, and nor should any other region be that for anyone."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has described as "scandalous" a criticism
by French Cooperation Minister Jacques Gcodfrain that
Christopher's recent visit to Africa was an electoral ploy of
President Bill Clinton. Christopher has rapped France's aid to
Africa as a "patronage".
</P>
<P>
"All demonstration of interest in Africa by big industrial
countries, such as the recent tour (of Africa) by the American
Secretary of State, should be greatly encouraged, especially those
which could help increase aid to the continent," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that each time the United States donates one dollar to
Africa, France applauds, because it indicates that the tendency of
disengagement by Washington from the Third World is not going
further.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. proposal to set up a pan-African peacekeeping
force, the spokesman said that the idea is "not new".
</P>
<P>
"The idea of reinforcing the capacities of Africans to
intervene by themselves in peacekeeping operations under the
mandate of the United Nations and the OAU (Organization of African
Unity) is not new," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. proposal only added something to "an
already old debate", referring to a France-proposed declaration on
peacekeeping missions in Africa adopted by the European Union in
Madrid in December 1995.

<HEADLINE> Nepal-Sri Lanka Joint Bank Launched in West Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A bank jointly invested by
the private sector of Nepal and Sri Lanka was launched today in
the western Nepali city of Lumbini.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural function of the Nepal-Bank of Ceylon
limited, Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said that his
government has adopted an open and liberal economic policy with
the objective of making the country a fertile ground for
investment in banking and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-Bank of Ceylon, a joint venture between Sri Lanka's
Bank of Ceylon and Nepal's NB group, was set up with a total of
500 million Nepali rupees (about 88 million US dollars) paid up
capital, the largest investment in a single private bank so far in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
According to bank sources, the Bank of Ceylon, Sri Lanka's
premier commercial bank, is investing a 45 percent stake in the
joint venture while the NB group, a leading Nepali trade and
financing group, is investing 25 percent with the rest shares set
aside for the general public.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-Bank of Ceylon is the first bank in Nepal to be based
outside Kathmandu, the capital city of the country.
</P>
<P>
The bank is planning to open branches in the capital and other
parts of the country in the near future to provide services for
development activities especially by the private sector, bank
officials said.
</P>
<P>
As 70 percent of the people in Sri Lanka are Buddhists, the
Bank of Ceylon chose to set up the new bank in Lumbini, birthplace
of the founder of Buddhism Sakyamuni, chairman of the Bank of
Ceylon R. N. Asirwatham said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, his bank will support the development
activities in rural Nepal by providing appropriate banking
services.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-Bank of Ceylon is the second joint venture in
banking sector between the two countries. A merchant bank was
launched jointly by the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and the NB
group of Nepal in Kathmandu last year.

JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu may meet Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat this week in a bid to break deadlock in the peace
talks, the English-language daily The Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting could take place as early as Wednesday, the
newspaper quoted a Palestinian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office neither ruled out such a
meeting, nor confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
Other Palestinian sources said that the idea of holding a
Netanyahu-Arafat summit was put forward by U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross Sunday when he met with Arafat in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The report came after Ross proposed one-day delay of the
Israeli-Palestinian talks originally scheduled to resume today in
Taba, Egypt, in order to bridge the wide gap between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
"This will give the ongoing discussions a chance to develop
further, and create a stronger basis for making progress when
the Taba-Eilat talks convene," Ross said in a statement, adding
that his own discussions and ongoing talks with the parties "have
been proven very useful."
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials expressed cautious optimism about progress
in the Hebron redeployment talks, as three sets of informal
discussions are being held to narrow the gap before the formal
negotiations resume in Taba.
</P>
<P>
In the informal talks, Ross held separate meetings with
Netanyahu and Arafat Saturday and Sunday, and is expected to
hold further meetings today.
</P>
<P>
Another set of talks is going on between senior officials of
the Israeli and Palestinians security forces, which will focus on
the security matters in Hebron redeployment. U.S. officials
believed joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols were a way of settling
the security issue.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, informal talks between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators on civilian matters are also being held to solve the
issue of zoning for Jewish settlers in Hebron. There are 450 Jews
living among 120,000 Palestinians in the town where the situation
is volatile for Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials described Ross' mediation efforts as very
"positive." They said that the U.S. would like to see the
toughest issues wrapped up during the current informal talks
between only a few officials on each side, believing it is hard
to make headway during formal sessions involving large
delegations.
</P>
<P>
After the past week of talks which resumed in the wake of the
recent bloodshed between Palestinians and Israeli forces, which
killed more than 70 people, the two sides failed to solve the
thorny issue of Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
While Israel demanded additional security arrangements in the
redeployment, the Palestinian side insisted on accurate
implementation of the signed agreement on Hebron pullback.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has warned that the failure of the talks could lead to
another wave of Palestinian violence. Meanwhile, he ruled out any
compromise on the issue of Hebron redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Landless People Told to Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Land and Water
Development Minister Cain Mathema on Sunday urged thousands of
landless Zimbabweans to register with responsible authorities and be
patient for their turn to be resettlled.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the increasing cases of landless people settling
themselves on state land all over the country, Mathema said the
government was aware of the need to speed up land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Landless people have argued that the government
has not fulfilled promises to give land to them, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they said, it allowed politicians to ''grab'' private
farms acquired for resettlement of the poor.
</P>
<P>
''People should understand that the government intends to settle
them orderly with all necessary facilities and also that funds have
been lacking until now when the British government has started
assisting,'' said Mathema.
</P>
<P>
He said if the government was bent on cheating people it would not
have settled the 62,000 families now farming on more than three
million hectares acquired since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are more than 100,000 families needing land and
the government has targeted to acquire at least 5,000 hectares each
year to meet demand. enditem

<HEADLINE> Romania Launches New Efforts to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister
Teordor Viorel Melescanu today flew to London and conveyed a
letter from Romanian President Ion Iliescu to British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Refkind.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu will also fly to Paris later in the day to give a
similar letter to French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier in a bid
to seek the French support for Romania's entry into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The Romanian president fully explained his country's stance on
its application for NATO membership. He said Romania has met the
requirements set by NATO and hoped to be among the first group of
countries joining the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Central and Eastern European nations from the Baltic to
Mediterranean seas, including Romania, have been seeking NATO
membership since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But NATO has been cautious on the issue because of Russia's
strong opposition. Russia has insisted that the NATO enlargement
eastward not threaten its national security.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO has been pushing forward its expansion process.
Discussions over possible candidates for NATO membership were held
in the first half of this year, following a visit by NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana to Central and Eastern European
countries between April and May.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The University of Hong Kong
and the Fudan University of Shanghai launched the first World Wide
Web (WWW) mutual mirroring system here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-Shanghai Information Network is a collaboration
between the Computer Center of the Hong Kong University (HKUCC)
and the Network and Information Engineering Center of Fudan
University, Shanghai (FUNIEC).
</P>
<P>
The idea of the project was first initiated by HKUCC and FUNIEC
a year ago when the two universities agreed to establish a closer
collaboration between them.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the Network is to make available selected
information of Hong Kong and Shanghai which are of common
interests in both cities, such as those on arts and culture,
commerce and industry, economy and trade, etc., to their Internet
communities.
</P>
<P>
And as Internet communications are becoming increasingly
important to modern societies, the development of the Information
Network is considered in the long term to be able to establish a
closer relationship, better understanding and strengthen
cooperation between the two cities and their residents.
</P>
<P>
This network project is an extension of an existing project of
mutual mirroring of the information kept on the WWW servers at the
two universities. Future development of the Network will realize
innovative ideas with state-of-the-art technologies for continuous
enhancement and refinement of the performance and functions of the
Network.

<HEADLINE> PLA Willing to Cooperate with Portuguese Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military
official said here today that the Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA) hopes to cooperate with the Portuguese armed forces in the
fields of education and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, chief of the PLA General Staff, said that the
relationship between the two armed forces constitutes an important
part of the China-Portugal ties, and high-level contact is
conducive to the good relationship between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During talks with his Portuguese counterpart Admiral Da Ponte,
Fu said he was satisfied with the smooth development of
cooperation between the two countries in political and economic
fields since they established diplomatic ties in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In particular, their cooperation on the issue of Macao has laid
a solid foundation for the further advancement of their friendly
relations, he noted.

would further strengthen the friendship between the two armed
forces as well as the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Slovenian Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
held talks with his Slovenian counterpart Milan Kucan here today
with both sides expressing satisfaction over growing bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Jiang
extended a warm welcome to Kucan, saying his visit will surely
deepen understanding and friendship between China and Slovenia and
the two peoples, and promote the steady progress of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Kucan briefed Jiang on the political and economic situation of
Slovenia over the past five years, since it gained independence
from former Yugoslavia, and also his country's domestic and
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China respects the Slovenian people's choices for
development as well as their policies, and that the country
supports Slovenia's independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and appreciates its peace policy in handling the crisis
of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the smooth development of comprehensive
cooperation between the two countries in all fields and the
positive results that have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that these factors combined have once again
proved that differences in historical and cultural tradition,
social systems, ideology and values do not obstruct the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that developing friendly and cooperative ties between
China and Slovenia is in keeping with the fundamental interests of
both countries, and that China is willing to further such ties on
the basis of such principles as mutual respect, equality and
mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates the "one China" position of the
Slovenian government concerning the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kucan said his country values China's role in the international
arena, and admires China's endeavor to build socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia is willing to look ahead and cultivate an all-round
partnership with China with a view toward the 21st century, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Jiang's remarks about developing bilateral ties
and pledged to stick to the "one China" principle and refrain from
forging official contacts with Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Weizman: Israel to Honor All Signed Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said here today that Israel respected all the agreements
previously signed with the Palestinians and would implement them.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the remark at a joint press conference with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at the end of their talks, which
started immediately after the Israeli president's arrival here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, in his turn, affirmed that Egypt would pursue its
endeavors until peace was established in the region.
</P>
<P>
He described the issue at stake now as how to further the
Middle East peace process to realize its final goal and establish
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has acted as a mediator between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, has repeatedly urged Israel to honor all the
agreements previously signed with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides discussed the current status
of the Palestinian issue and exchanged views on a number of
questions, said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu soon, Mubarak said there should be no problem but he
linked the prospective meeting to Israeli troop redeployment in
the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"I could meet Netanyahu when the issue of Hebron is solved,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time magazine to be published today,
Mubarak has accused the Israeli prime minister of derailing peace
efforts by reneging on agreements to pull the Israeli army out of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said Sunday that his Cairo visit was aimed at
improving relations between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes at a time when the renewed Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks have so far failed to achieve tangible results and
the Israeli-Egyptian ties have became strained over Israel's
procrastination in implementing the Arab-Israeli agreements
previously signed.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Sunday that he hoped
Weizman could influence Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to change his hardline policy toward Arab-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> HK Investment Bank Diving Into China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong-based investment
bank announced today to set up a subsidiary in Shanghai as an
important step in its aggressive expansion into the lucrative
capital market of China.
</P>
<P>
The Seapower Financial Services Group (Seapower) has recently
gained approval from the People's Bank of China, the country's
central bank, to open its China headquarters in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liping, chairman of Seapower, was confident that his
company would turn out to be the most competitive investment
banking house in China although many contenders have already
jumped into the emerging market.
</P>
<P>
Big names among investment bankers such as Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have got involved in China's
business in different forms. Hong Kong-based financial companies,
such as Peregrine, have become known as the sponsors of quite a
number of H shares, issued by state-owned Chinese enterprises on
the Hong Kong bourse.
</P>
<P>
But in Zhang's view, the market in China is big enough for all
competitors. He believed that Seapower has some strong points to
distinguish itself from others.
</P>
<P>
Seapower has an accomplished team of professionals with
experience in both the eastern and western business environments,
said Zhang. Its comparative advantage also lies in a strong client
base and good government relationships in China.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that we have a strategic commitment to
China," he said. Seapower has actively participated in
underwriting all the H shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange so far this year. It also has acted as the international
coordinator in placing 80 million B shares for a China tourism
company.
</P>
<P>
Seapower's next aim is to act as the sponsor for Chinese
enterprises that are queuing up for listing on the Hong Kong
bourse, according to Zhang.

<HEADLINE> Marseille Legislative By-Election Shocks France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The outcome of the legislative
by-election held on Sunday in Gardanne outside Marseille has
shocked France, with two political parties on the two ends of the
French political stratum gaining most of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Roger Mei, the Communist mayor of the working class town in the
10th constituency of the department of Bouches-du-Rhone, won 37.87
percent of the votes while the far-right National Front (FN)
candidate Damien Bariller got 26.8 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The candidate for the ruling Rassemblement pour la Republique
(RPR), Herve Fabre-Aubrespy, ranked third with 16.63 percent of
the votes, followed by the socialist candidate Bernard Kouchner
with 13.29 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Both of them were thus knocked out in the first round of the
voting.
</P>
<P>
The result marked a strong rise of support for both the
Communist Party and the FN as compared with that for the 1993
legislative election, with the Communists gaining 18.65 percentage
points, and the FN gaining 7.83 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Turnout rate for Sunday's by-election, aimed at electing a
member of the French National Assembly to replace Bernard Tapie
who was stripped of his seat over a series of financial scandals,
was strikingly low at about 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after a partial result of the poll came out, Mei
called on voters to make the second-round voting on October 20 "a
great victory against hatred and exclusion" which is sold by the
FN.
</P>
<P>
He said that the result of the election also showed a popular
rejection of the policy of Prime Minister Alain Juppe, and that
even the "astray" choice made by some voters to support the FN
also "demonstrates very strongly the discontent and confusion of a
great number of people" over the policy of Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, head of the Citizens' Movement and
former defense minister, said that the victory of the Communist
Party indicates that the Maastricht Treaty calling for the
building of a unified European market is "massively rejected" by
the French people.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party today called on its supporters to vote for
the Communist Party in the second round of the voting, while the
RPR said it would not give any "instruction" to its supporters for
the runoff election.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Palestinian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that peaceful
negotiations between Palestine and Israel and the peace process in
the Middle East is the general trend of the times.
</P>
<P>
Holding talks this morning with Palestinian Foreign Minister
Faruq al-Kaddumi, Qian said the Middle East problem is the most
long-lasting regional conflict since the Second World War, and is
one which greatly concerns China.
</P>
<P>
The problem of Palestine and the Middle East can be settled
through political negotiations, he said, but because of the
complexities and complications involved, setbacks and relapses are
unavoidable in the course of the talks, and confrontation can not
resolve the issues.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Minister said progress in peaceful talks
between Palestine and Israel, and in the Middle East peace process
as a whole, is not only in the best interest of the Palestinians
and the Arabs, but also of the Israeli people. Such advances also
will contribute to the complete and lasting peace and stability in
the Middle East. Therefore it is the general trend of the times,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Qian, the Middle East peace process should be
realized on the basis of relevant UN resolutions, with "land for
peace" being the basic principle of the peace talks. He added that
all agreements reached between Palestine and Israel must be
respected and effectively implemented.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed the Chinese people, the reliable friends of the
Palestinians, have always supported the Palestinians' just cause
of restoring their legitimate national rights. He added that China
is satisfied with its friendly, cooperative relations with
Palestine, and is grateful for Palestine's "one China" stand on
the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After conveying to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng the regards of Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestine
State and the Palestinian National Authority, Kaddumi briefed Qian
on the current situation of the Middle East peace process and the
Palestine-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kaddumi said the current negotiations are at a standstill, and
the peace process is experiencing difficulty. However, he noted,
certain elements in the Middle East have emerged which might push
the situation there to a positive direction.
</P>
<P>
Kaddumi, who is visiting China for the tenth time, also
extended thanks on behalf of the Palestinian people to the Chinese
government and people for their support of the just cause of the
Palestinian people and the Arabs, and for actively pushing forward
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kaddumi expressed the hope that China will play a bigger role
in promoting the peace process in the Middle East. He reiterated
the Palestinian people's support for China's peaceful
reunification, opposing any attempts for "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan."

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Large-scale Nuclear Power Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China is set to begin
large-scale nuclear power construction in the coming five years,
with plans to build four nuclear power plants and eight reactors
in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong and Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Conference on China-EU Energy Cooperation held
in Beijing today, chief engineer of the China National Nuclear
Corporation Zhu Xuhui said that China's present capacity of
installed electricity hits 210,000 MW, of which 2,100 MW is
produced by nuclear power. In light of the State plan, the
country's nuclear power installed capacity is expected to reach
20,000 MW by the year of 2010, accounting for three or four
percent of the country's total, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The expert noted that nuclear power is a safe, economical and
clean energy resource, which is attracting greater attention in
China. The successful building and safe operation of the Qinshan
and Daya Bay nuclear power plants have demonstrated the safety and
satisfactory economic efficiency of the country's nuclear power
projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
Presently, more and more Chinese provinces have regarded the
development of nuclear power plants as an effective solution to
the shortage of energy resources and the means to resolve the
environmental and transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
A number of provinces, including Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian,
Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and Guangxi, have requested to develop
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China has been selecting sites for the
construction of nuclear power plants, and so far there are 10
acceptable sites available for the construction of 40,000 MW
nuclear power units.
</P>
<P>
According to the chief engineer, China boasts abundant uranium
resources and a complete nuclear fuel cycle system. For many
years, China has operated a uranium-enrichment plant with gas
diffusion technology. In recent years, the country also introduced
a gas centrifuge process from abroad.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has successfully produced fuel assemblies
for Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, introduced the production
technology of fuel assemblies for Daya Bay from France, and built
the production line.
</P>
<P>
The expert predicts that China's annual uranium production
capacity will reach 150 tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He added that the preparatory work for constructing new nuclear
power plants is going smoothly. A group of new nuclear power
projects are scheduled to be put into operation in Qinshan and
Daya Bay between 2001 and 2003.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Financial Checkup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to initiate a
national campaign to check tax collection, financing activities
and prices starting next month, in an effort to further improve
the financial and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, a state councillor, told a televised national
conference today that similar check-ups since 1985 have netted 161
billion yuan (about 19.4 billion US dollars) in illegal funds,
with 111.6 billion yuan eventually ending up in the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled examination, to end before mid-February, will
cover all enterprises, institutions, administrative bodies, social
groups and private industrial and commercial business people,
according to a State Council circular issued today.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that the check-ups have over the past 11 years
contributed to the consolidation of macro-control by helping
rectify the financial and economic order, balance the budget and
curb price increases.
</P>
<P>
"They have also played a significant role in combating
corruption and promoting reforms and economic development," Luo
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, some financial and economic problems cannot
be permanently solved by a dozen national check-ups.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must not overestimate what we have achieved and
must be fully prepared for the difficulties and long-term nature
of the drive to rectify the financial and economic order," Luo
said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion and cheating, illegal retaining and diversion of
financial incomes, squandering of State financial assets,
arbitrary fees and unauthorized pricings still exist in great
numbers, according to Luo.
</P>
<P>
"Such problems have severely damaged the normal financial and
taxation distribution orders as well as price management," he
said, calling for greater efforts to supervise tax collection,
financial activities and prices.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongli, minister of Finance, said such examinations are
effective measures for rectifying the financial and economic order
and promoting the sound development of the national economy at the
current stage.

<HEADLINE> China's Nine-Month Tax Revenue Up 21.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China collected 452.9 billion
yuan (about 54.56 billion US dollars) in industrial and commercial
taxes in the first nine months of this year, up 21.1 percent over
the same 1995 period, a senior tax official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hao Zhaocheng, deputy director of the State Administration of
Taxation, said during a televised national conference today that
the amount represented 75.1 percent of this year's target.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that 249.8 billion yuan went to the central
coffer, a year-on-year rise of 19.6 percent. The amount collected
by the local governments grew 22.9 percent to 203.1 billion yuan
between January and September.
</P>
<P>
The consumption tax and the value-added tax, two major tax
items under the new revenue-sharing taxation system China
introduced in 1994, came to 256.4 billion yuan in the period, up
17.4 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Hao said that problems still exist in taxation, citing tax
evasion and other forms of cheating as the most serious.
</P>
<P>
Another outstanding problem is a time lag of 4.9 percent in the
collection of the consumption tax and the valued-added tax, Hao
said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized regional imbalance in the growth rate of tax
collection, which reached over 25 percent in Shanghai, Shandong,
Sichuan and another eight areas, and stood below five percent in
Guangxi, Qinghai, Shenyang and Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Delayed tax payments also rose by 16 billion yuan in the first
nine months to 39.7 billion yuan by the end of September, Hao
noted, urging taxation departments nationwide to reinforce
measures to supervise the collection of taxes.
</P>
<P>
A national checkup of tax collection last year netted 16.577
billion yuan in tax evasion and cheating, in addition to 3.52
billion yuan in overdue taxes, Hao told participants at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Palestinian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said today that China supports the efforts to resolve the Middle
East problem through political negotiations, in keeping with the
principle of "land for peace" while adhering to the relevant
resolutions of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, said during a meeting here with
visiting Palestinian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Kaddumi, that the
Palestinian people's just cause for the restoration of national
rights and interests has gained wide-ranging sympathy and support
from the international community.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed China's concern over the situation in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said he was glad to see al-Kaddumi again, as their last
meeting was in 1992 when Qiao visited Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said he is convinced that people in the Middle East,
including the Israelis, wish to see a continuation of the peace
process and are not willing to experience new conflicts and wars,
because these would harm both the Arab and Israeli people, and
peace is in the fundamental interest of everyone there, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said China holds that "the agreements reached between
Palestine and Israel should be earnestly implemented, and parties
concerned should continue the peace process on the existing basis."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that China supports the efforts by the Arab
states to strengthen unity and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East is bound to
be realized, as long as the peace process there can be promoted
and world-wide support is gained, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
After conveying the regards to Qiao of Yasser Arafat, President
of the Palestine State, al-Kaddumi expressed his appreciation for
the Chinese people's long-term and firm support for the
Palestinian people and their just cause, on behalf of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the peace process in the Middle East and the
Palestine-Israel talks, al-Kaddumi said that the Middle East
situation is presently facing difficulties, agreements between
Palestine and Israel have not been implemented, and two-way peace
talks between Israel and other countries have not made any
concrete progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian people, who have lost their
legitimate national rights and interests, are longing for peace,
and they have made and will continue to make efforts for the
realization of a comprehensive and just peace.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that China will play a more active role in
promoting peace in the Middle East, and that the international
community will push the peace process forward in a healthy
manner.

<HEADLINE> US Keeps Pressure on Nigeria for Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will take
"appropriate steps" against Nigeria if it fails to restore democracy
earnestly, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher has reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
This was the second warning in one week of probable American
economic santions by Christopher.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear in Mali early last week at the beginning of his
five-nation African tour that the US was galvanizing a multilateral
coalition for decisive punitive economic measures against nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Unclear political direction set by the Nigerian military
administration bothers the US, said Christopher, who had earlier
complained about the poor human rights record and corruption in the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
"The United States hopes that the Nigerian government will move
forward with political and economic reform," he told the South African
Institute for International Affairs, a leading thinktank on
international relations.
</P>
<P>
"We are open to dialogue with its leaders but we are prepared to
take appropriate steps if repression continues," he added, quoted by
the "Guardian" newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has announced a three-year program to return to civil rule
with a democratically elected president installed by October 1, 1998.
But some countries, particularly western countries such as the United
States and Canada, have called for an earlier date of democratization.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said Nigeria should be a leader in Africa but its
government has "squandered their nation's potential and made it the
poorest oil-rich country on earth."
</P>
<P>
The effects of drug trafficking and corruption are also being felt
as far away as North America and South Africa, he told the audience of
academics and business people.  enditem

<HEADLINE> S'pore Managers Most Stressed, Survey Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Business managers in
Singapore are the most stressed in the world, according to an
international survey on the effects of information overload on
managers, which was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, called "Dying for Information" was carried by
Reuters Business Information (RBI).
</P>
<P>
In the survey, more than 1,300 managers from the United States,
the United Kingdom, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore were
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 27 percent of Singaporean managers
interviewed said that their work environments were stressful on a
day to day basis compared to an average of 16 percent for managers
from countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
RBI Asia Director Mark Trasenter said the stress was attributed
to increased external communications like E-mail and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly half of the managers interviewed also
predicted that stress in the work place caused by information
overload would continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Transenter pointed out that only a more efficient
information sorting system could alleviate the situation.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that companies analyze their information
needs and make sure that the data is accurate, timely and
relevant.

Hall of the People, saying that bilateral ties have strengthened
since the two countries established diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu welcomed the Vice-Premier, who accompanied Slovenian
President Milan Kucan on his state visit to China. Wu said he
believed the visit by the Vice-Premier would help enhance mutual
understanding in terms of economic cooperation and trade, thus
exchanging what one needs and pushing the overall development of
the bilateral economic and trade relationship.

opportunity for establishing direct links and cooperation between
businesses in the two countries.
</P>

important, and he hopes to further expand the two-way trade while
increasing economic cooperation in various forms.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani regards his Iraqi counterpart Saddam Hussein as a major
threat to peace and tranquility in the region, including Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said: "We know the Ba'ath Party very well. If
their hands are open they would not let the region to be
in calm and tranquility."
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president made the statement in an interview
with German Weekly Der Spiegel and the full text of the interview
was published by all local Persian dailies today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the whole region has been confronted with a
bigger danger.
</P>
<P>
As to how long would Saddam Hussein stay in power, he
replied: "It is the policy of the Americans who think that
they should keep Saddam in power in the way it is."
</P>
<P>
"Using this policy," he noted, "the United States has been
able to keep all southern Persian Gulf countries in its fist
and isolate its competitors at the same time."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988. Iran
wants to normalize relations with the former enemy, but some big
problems stand on in the way, including the issue of prisoners of
war.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries agreed and maintained a cease-fire
since August, 1988, there is no real peace between the two
rivals. During the past years, the two sides have time and again
accused each other of violating the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In the border areas, there is a "no war and no peace"
state. The two countries still keep a large number of their
respective armed forces along the borders.
</P>
<P>
Both sides criticized the other for lack of trust and
sincerity in talks.

Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met in
Beijing today with a Thai procuratorial delegation, led by
Procurator-General Kanit Nanakorn.

<P>
Qiao said that the two countries are neighbors with good ties,
and it is beneficial for leaders of the two countries to visit
each other regularly to exchange information and experience.
</P>
<P>
He said that only by strengthening legislation, firmly
implementing the laws and accumulating experiences one step at a
time, can a legal system move towards perfection, which is an
indispensable condition for healthy economic development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao expressed his hope that procuratorial organs of both sides
will strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kanit said that this is his first China trip aimed at
strengthening cooperation with China, in a move to make joint
efforts to help stop crime.
</P>
<P>
Kanit also pointed out that there are not only frequent
high-level contacts between the two countries, but also close
relations between the two peoples, and he hoped that cooperation
between procuratorial organs of the two sides can be strengthened.

Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Chinese Supreme
People's Procuratorate, met with and feted the delegation here

According to the agreement, the training center, to be
administered under a joint committee composed of officials from

<HEADLINE> Anti-Nuclear Activists Demand Release of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of anti-nuclear
activists from Israel and other countries have launched a
campaign to demand the release of Mordechai Vanunu, former
Israeli nuclear technician jailed for divulging nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group demonstrated on his behalf outside the
Prime Minister's Office Sunday here to mark a decade since his
imprisonment. They handed in an appeal signed by 12,000
Norwegians.
</P>
<P>
The appeal also requested an end to his solitary confinement
in Ashkelon Prison, south of Tel Aviv. A copy of the appeal
was faxed to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The group of Vanunu supporters held a two-day international
conference in Tel Aviv Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vanunu reportedly revealed Israel's atomic activities in Dimona
Nuclear Center to a British newspaper during his trip abroad.
He was caught by Israeli secret agents in Italy and taken
back to Israel.
</P>
<P>
An International Committee for the Liberation of Mordechai
Vanunu was set up shortly after to coordinate efforts to secure
his release.
</P>
<P>
In the appeal written directly to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, supporters of Vanunu said: "Today, on the day 10 years
since he was kidnaped, we would like to make a personal appeal
to your humanity, hoping that you will use your authority to end
the plight of Mordechai Vanunu."
</P>
<P>
"He has been kept in solitary confinement in a small cell in
Ashkelon Prison for 10 years, a sad case of persistent brutality
and inhuman treatment which has shocked people all over the
world," the appeal added. "We have been hoping that the new
government through an amnesty or clemency would end this sad
affair and not permit it to continue to hurt the traditional good
will Israel enjoys and tarnish its international image."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Equity Funds Show Good Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Equity funds that focus their
investment in Hong Kong stocks yielded the highest annual returns
in September.
</P>
<P>
According to a performance survey released today by the Hong
Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA), equity funds pinning on
the local stock market posted an annual return of 26 percent by
the end of September, topping the list for the second consecutive
month.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of 1996, Hong Kong equity funds
consistently stayed in the top five positions in terms of annual
returns, running ahead of equity funds that play in stock markets
elsewhere, such as North America, Latin America, Europe, other
Asian areas, Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
HKIFA Chairman Andrew Lo attributed the robust performance to
the decision made by the U.S. Federal Reserve not to raise
interest rates. He noted however that the recovery of the Hong
Kong property and retail markets also helped boost investment
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA consists of 45 fund management companies and 34
associated members, including trustees and related professionals.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: US Sanction Fails to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani has said that U.S. sanction on his country did not
work at all and Iran's oil export income would reach 20 billion
dollars this year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president made the remarks in an interview
with German Weekly Der Spiegel and the full text of the interview
was published by all local Persian dailies today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that U.S. sanction "really has had no effect"
on Iran's economy. "I see no area negatively affected or under
pressure."
</P>
<P>
"This sanction only brings loss for the Americans
themselves. Its consequence has been that the American firms can
not participate at (in) Iran's fair and are deprived of presence
at Iran's multiple oil, gas and petrochemical projects," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that his country would earn some
20 billion dollars by exporting crude oil and there are also
some other income this year.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to use some of our foreign credits to construct
the country's infrastructure. We have rescheduled our debts and
pay 4 billion dollars of foreign debt annually," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's total foreign debt is 21 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the foreign debt is not burdensome for Iran
which has 20 billion dollars in oil income along with income
from non-oil income.

<HEADLINE> EU Takes Case Against Japanese Harbor Practice to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
decided today to make a formal complaint to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) against alleged discriminatory treatment of
foreign shipping companies in Japanese harbors.
</P>
<P>
Stevedores, who load and unload ships, are organized in Japan
through the Japan Harbor Transportation Association (JHTA), an
organization established under the auspices of the ministry of
transport.
</P>
<P>
Through a "prior consultation system," the JHTA controls all
loading and unloading of ships in Japanese harbors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign shipping firms are thus obliged to consult the Japanese
harbor authorities in advance "even on minor changes" in their
schedules.
</P>
<P>
"This monopoly on stevedoring in Japan gives the JHTA
tremendous power over shipping lines," an EC spokesman said,
noting that prices of port operations in Japan were "well above"
international levels.
</P>
<P>
"This can result in large supplementary costs, given the high
price even of just a day's loading and unloading," he added.
</P>
<P>
While the Japanese government asserted that it was a "private
sector matter," the European Union insisted that, as the JHTA
operated under ministerial license and guidance, the Japanese
government should use its influence to reduce the barriers to
trade created by the mandated consultation.
</P>
<P>
The EU's action today follows several years of diplomatic
efforts which have failed to bring about any fundamental
restructuring of the Japanese consultation system.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic organizers said
it would not be able to cope with an increase competitors over the
preriously forecast in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, Sydney officials will travel to an
International Olympic Committee executive board meeting in Mexico
next month determined to stand firm on a maximum of 10,000
competitors at the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
The report said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch warned on
Friday in Lausanne that Sydney could face an increase of up to 600
athletes over the previously forecast figure of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight and
Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) president John Coates both said
that Sydney had budgeted on 10,000 athletes attending and would
not budge from that figure.
</P>
<P>
"After Barcelona the IOC itself identified that the issue of
gigantism was an issue that ranked alongside the issue of drug
taking afflicting the Olympics," Coates was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have to draw a line in the sand, but I don't underestimate
that this is a very vexed issue and an emotional one."
</P>
<P>
Knight, who also is chairman of the Sydney Organizing Committee
(SOCOG), said he was confident that on the issue of numbers
"Sydney will win".

<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- New Senate Minority leader
Neptali Gonzales confirmed here today that he is set to formally
tender his resignation as president emeritus and member of the
Laban party.
</P>
<P>
"I am filing my resignation as president emiritus and member of
the Laban on the ground that it is no longer the same party that I
helped found and once led," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Senator Edgardo Angara, chairman of the Laban party,
urged his partymates who have refused to break away from the
ruling Lakas ng Edsa and National Union of Christian Democrats
(LAKAS-NUCD) to resign.
</P>
<P>
Angara was reportedly insulted by the fact that Gonzales,
together with four other Laban members, moved to form a
"Progressive Minority Coalition" with three LAKAS-NUCD members on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During their first meeting held at Gonzales' residence on the
same day, the eight opposition senators also elected Gonzales as
new minority leader in the upper chamber of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was deprived of the Senate presidency last Thursday by
Angara and senator Ernesto Maceda of the Nationalist People's
Coalition. Maceda was installed as new Senate president in the
Senate's re-organization.

TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Kurdish refugees settled
in the Iranian border camps are preparing to return to their
home country following the recent developments in northern Iraq,
an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Marivan Governor Ali Yari was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying that following the reports that the forces
of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) were driven out of the
northern Iraqi city of Sulaimaniya, about 1,000 refugees who
settled in Bashmaq and Sayranband camps in western border
province of Kordestan have left Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trend is very slow at present, but more are
expected to leave in the coming days if the situation becomes
stabilized there.
</P>
<P>
More than 45,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees have been
accommodated at the two border camps of Bashmaq in Marivan and
Sayranband in Baneh.
</P>
<P>
The refugees fled to Iran a month ago after forces of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (KDP) pulled out of northern Iraq
in the wake of a joint KDP and Iraqi government forces
attack.

Though the jobless increased in France and Belgium, they

<TEXT>
<P>
NANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Renewed fighting between Moro
rebels and government troops has left nine people dead and 17
others wounded in the southern part of the country, the Philippine
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said some 200 rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) attacked a detachment of soldiers guarding a dam near
Cotabato City in the southern Philippines Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing gun battle, the rebels took positions in
populated areas as soldiers pounded them with mortars. A local
army spokesman said there were no casualties on the army side, but
he pointed out that he could not give details about casualties on
the enemy side.
</P>
<P>
But MILF political affairs chief Gadzali Gaafar said most of
the casualties in the clash were "civilians and native inhabitants
of the area."
</P>
<P>
The MILF became the largest rebel group in the country after
the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
signed a peace agreement in September this year.
</P>
<P>
The MILF opposes the peace accord and has vowed to continue
seeking Muslim independence in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine government is still preparing for peace

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Jordan for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived here today for a brief visit to the Kingdom for talks
with King Hussein on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who were welcomed by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti and other senior officials upon his arrival, will
brief the king on the latest developments of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, which resumed last week after
the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
The king, who, along with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, attended the White House summit called by
U.S. President Bill Clinton to salvage the peace process,
expressed full support for the Palestinian causes.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the king criticized the Israeli prime
minister's policies and warned that they were pushing the region
toward the brink of an abyss.
</P>
<P>
The king's uncharacteristically harsh words to Netanyahu
caused shockwaves in Israel's leadership and society, which look
the Jordanian-Israeli ties as an example of good relations with
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
A senior official here told Xinhua that the king's criticism
of Israel was aimed at ringing alarm bells over the seriousness
of the crisis in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kabariti also repeatedly affirmed that Jordan's
ties with Israel were in "crisis" because of Israel's failure
to honor its commitments and implement the agreements it has
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian senior officials have indicated that the only way
out of the crisis was for Israel to implement its agreements
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Arafat's visit to Amman came within
the context that his self-rule Palestinian Authority (PA) has
voiced appreciation over Jordan's stands toward the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Private Pharmacies to Operate in Public Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan pharmacists will be
allowed to operate private pharmacies in public hospitals once
the government privatizes part of the health sector, according to
a "Kenya Times" report today.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which is part of the liberalization of the health
sector, was announced by Kenyan Health Minister Joshua Angatia
yesterday when he officially opened the new Doctor's Plaza at the
Aga Khan Hospital in the port city of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted as saying that his government is
seeking means to bring down the "extremely high" prices of drugs
in the east African country by implementing competitive
policies.
</P>
<P>
He said that private pharmacists were too unrealistically
profit-driven and were making superabnormal profits at the
expense of patients.
</P>
<P>
Angatia clarified that the present subsidized pharmacies in
public hospitals would continue to operate normally, the paper
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Set Up APEC Art Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will set up an
APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) art garden that will
exhibit sculptures from the 18 APEC members, the APEC '96 News
Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that APEC trade and foreign ministers are set to unveil
the garden, which will be set up in the quadrangle of the
Philippine International Convention Center in Manila, when they
are here for a special meeting on November 22.
</P>
<P>
Seven APEC members-- the Philippines, Australia, Brunei,
Indonesia, Hongkong, New Zealand and Canada-- have already
promised to display their sculptures in the garden, the news
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Other APEC members are Chile, China, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The news bureau quoted Cristina Ortega, chief coordinator for
the project, as saying that the sculptures should be made of
lighter materials, such as brass, stainless steel, copper,
acrylic, or fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
They should be five to 10 feet high, and have a maximum weight
of 1,500 pounds, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ortega said that the Philippines will shoulder the costs of
mounting the sculpture pieces as well as of landscaping, but the
respective economies will have to shoulder the cost of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The garden is to commemorate not only the Philippines' hosting
of this year's Informal APEC Leadership Conference, but also the
cooperation shared within the region.
</P>
<P>
The Informal APEC Leadership Conference are scheduled for
November 25 in Subic Bay, 80 kilometers north of Manila.

<HEADLINE> Education, Training Sector to be Decentralized in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The education and
training sector will be decentralized in Tanzania in the near
future, whereby regions, districts, community and educational
institutions will be given power to manage and administer the
sector.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by Minister of Education and Culture Juma
Kapunya at a prize-giving ceremony to the best secondary school
students of Dar es Salaam Region, who won in a mock exam for over
5,000 students from 20 secondary schools in 13 subjects, here
over the weekend.
</P>

education and training sector through strengthening in-service
teacher training programs as well as the supply of teaching and
learning materials.
</P>
<P>
According to a newspaper today, Kapunya said the government
would expand the provision of education and training through
liberalization of the sector. He said the government would
promote and strengthen formal and non-formal, distance and out of
school education programs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said as the world enters the 21st century, it
was important to realize that Tanzania as a member of the world
community has an obligation to promote science and technology for
the betterment of its people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The government would promote science and technology through
intensification of vocational education, training and
rationalization of tertiary institutions including the
establishment of polytechnics and training of technologists, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister further said that his ministry would promote
access and equity through making access of basic education

<HEADLINE> UK's Rabies Law Could Be Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture Minister Douglas
Hogg is proposing a review of Britain's quarantine rules which
could lead to the world's toughest rabies controls being scrapped,
the Times newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
In a paper circulated among cabinet ministers, Hogg suggested
it might be time to abandon quarantine for a passport-for-pets
scheme based on the Swedish model, strict new rules on vaccination
and blood testing.
</P>
<P>
The move follows intense pressure on the government from
advocate groups, including diplomats and foreign service families,
who claim that the British policy, enforced since l901, is too
draconian and out of proportion to the threat, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
Under Britain's anti-rabies system, thousands of family pets
face six months of quarantine in kennels each year. They are
confined in pens and not allowed to roam freely with other
animals. The quarantine costs for animal owners, who are allowed
to visit their pets, can be up to two thousand pounds (3,150 U.S
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thousands of pets are smuggleed into Britain each year because
families cannot afford quarantine fees or because they are opposed
to their animals being caged.
</P>
<P>
Many of the law-breakers are pet owners who have vaccinated and
blood-tested their animals and can prove they are rabies free.
</P>
<P>
But the real threat comes from unscrupulous pet owners who
smuggle animals without vaccines from countries where the virus is
rampant.
</P>
<P>
The most common way to smuggle a pet into Britain is to hide it
in a car. A woman who has smuggled a dog through customs on three
occasions said she felt no guilt about breaking the quarantine
law: "I know my dog hasn't got rabies and I can prove it."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major is reported to have offered
cautious support for rabies law reform, but reservations have been
expressed by Home Secretary Michael Howard, who is worried about
the impact on the reform.

PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- French paramilitary police
arrested 14 villagers Sunday in a village in the South Pacific
island of New Caledonia after two policemen and one villager were
wounded in clashes.
</P>
<P>
The villagers will be tried for participating in armed assembly
and violating free circulation of public highway, a court in Noumea,
the capital of the French colony, said today.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's clash started when police tried to remove a road block
set up by local villagers on a main highway of the island to
protest against the air and water pollution caused by a French
nickel ore nearby.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, who are inhabitants of a hamlet beside the
commune of Boulouparis, 70 kilometers from Noumea, accused the
French ore boss of failing to fulfil his promise on environmental
protection by expanding his project.
</P>
<P>
This is the second clash between police and the villagers in a
month.
</P>
<P>
The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FNLKS), the main
independence movement of New Caledonia, recently asked the French
government to immediately resume negotiations on the independence
process of the island.

According to official sources, about 23,000 people are
suffering from malaria in the state and about 5,000 of them are in
the fatal stage of the disease.

<P>
The state government admits to the death toll but said all
these were not malaria deaths as a majority of them died due to
other seasonal diseases, which generally break out after the rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
A State Health Department spokesman said more than 4,500 mobile
medical units are now functioning in the affected areas, where
more than 20,000 drug distribution outlets have been opened.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Arrives in Egypt for Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
arrived here this morning for talks with his Egyptian counterpart
Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak met Weizman at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said Sunday that his Cairo visit was aimed at improving
relations between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes at a time when the renewed Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks have so far failed to achieve tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Sunday that he hoped
Weizman could influence Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to change his hardline policy toward Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has acted as a mediator between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, has repeatedly urged Israel to honor all the
agreements already signed with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hope that Weizman's Cairo visit will promote
negotiations on all tracks, especially after the failure of the
Washington summit attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Yasser Arafat and
Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Netanyahu and Arafat failed to agree on any
outstanding issues between Israel and the PA, including Israel's
long-delayed withdrawal from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The current Palestinian-Israeli talks, which were scheduled to
move to Egypt's resort town of Taba today, have been postponed for
one day.

<HEADLINE> Map of Pudong New Area Keeps on Renewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) --Shanghai's Pudong New Area is
changing so far that the city's map makers cannot keep up with its
ever changing horizons.
</P>
<P>
The map has continually needed revising ever since its first
edition was published six years ago, due to changes in the
development zone.
</P>
<P>
The ninth edition of the map, which has just come off the
press, has still provoked the regrets of local map
publishers. They admit it is impossible to catch up with the daily
changes in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Pudong, which covers 522 square kilometers, used to be a mere
geographical concept for part of Shanghai on the eastern bank of
Huangpu River. Before the 1990s it did not even have a name on
official maps.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Pudong was made an economic development zone by the
central government in order to speed up the opening of Shanghai,
and since then the area has entered into a rapid development era.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, over 200 highrises have emerged in
Pudong, together with over 1,000 new roads, 8,000-plus Chinese and
foreign enterprises, over 20 newly-built residential blocks, as
well as hundreds of shops and markets, while numerous outdated,
shabby houses have gone forever.
</P>
<P>
Producing maps for an area like Pudong, where 5,000-6,000 new
projects are launched every year, is a tough job for local map
publishers, observers point out.
</P>
<P>
Local map printers, and those who have to rely on maps, predict
it will be impossible to get "complete" copies of Pudong New Area
maps until 2020. By then the area is scheduled to take shape,
according to the government plan.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Anti-drug Campaign Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese police authority has
arrested 1,948 drug-related criminals in 644 cases in September
during a nationwide anti-drug campaign, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched by the People's Police Department under
the Ministry of the Interior in coordination with relevant
agencies.
</P>
<P>
So far, the police has seized 95 Kilograms of opium, 0.7 kg of
heroin, 193.8 kg of marijuana, and 11,900 'balls' of opium and
packages of heroin and destroyed 8,000 marijuana plants.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drug abuse-related cases were discovered in the big
cities such as Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, as well as the
provinces of Nghe An, Quang Nam-da Nang, Quang Ninh and Lao Cai.
</P>
<P>
In order to cope with the rampant drug-related crimes, the
police from the central to local levels have co-ordinated with all
related organizations in fighting against social evils, especially
drug abuse and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Local people's organizations across the country are also
mobilized across the country to help drug addicts give up their
bad habit through medical treatment and job training.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Unveils Plans for Asia-Europe Business Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand today pushed ahead its
proposal to establish a business information exchange system on
the Internet as a measure to forge closer business ties between
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ASEM business forum which opened in Paris
today, Staporn Kavitanon, secretary-general of the Board of
Investment (BOI) of Thailand, said that such a system is needed as
many companies in Asia and Europe show strong interest in sharing
more information about business and investment.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was part of the preliminary action plan unveiled
by Thailand to push ahead the Asia-Europe investment action plan
formulated during the first Asia-Europe meeting (ASEM) held in
Bangkok in March this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the board today, Staporn also
proposed that an ASEM business conference be organized to
strengthen contacts between Asian and European businessmen on
those themes of common interest.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Staporn called for the launching of
business-related public relations campaign to build the spirit of
Asia-Europe cooperation and broaden awareness of the ASEM
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that differences on investment policies and
regulations did exist between the two continents during the first
ASEM government and private sector working group meeting held in
Bangkok in July 1996, Staporn said time and continued efforts are
needed to resolve these differences.
</P>
<P>
Staporn proposed to set investment principles and business
dispute settlement bodies to help resolve the differences to
facilitate cooperation between Asia and Europe.

<HEADLINE> EU Backs Mandela's Stance on African Peace-keeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
would support an initiative of the United Nations or the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), but not the U.S. proposal,
for the establishment of a crisis intervention force in Africa.
</P>
<P>
EU Trade Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro said Sunday in
Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, that the EU tended to follow
South African President Nelson Mandela's line on the world body
and other groups concerning the U.S.-proposed African intervention
force, a local newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro said he would submit a proposal at the two-day EU-SADC
(Southern African Development Community) Ministerial Conference
that opens today that conflict resolution be undertaken at a very
early stage even before fighting erupted.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the major role-players in the proposed
African peacekeeping force must be the Africans themselves, with
the EU providing technical and financial support.
</P>
<P>
Mandela expressed his idea, while meeting with visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher last Saturday in Cape
Town, that the initiative to establish an African peacekeeping
force to deal with problems on the continent should come from the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said any such initiative would have to be widely
discussed with the OAU and the SADC, and only the U.N. could give
such a force credibility for success.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was currently on his eight-day five-nation Africa
tour, seeking support for the creation of an
American-funded-and-equipped 10,000-member African Crisis
Response Force.

CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's tourism proceeds in
1995/1996 soared to unprecedented three billion U.S. dollars, up
23.7 percent over the previous fiscal year, a local English daily
said today, citing a report by Egypt's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism Mamdouh El-Beltagui has attributed the
success to the great efforts by the Ministry of Tourism and other
government organs concerned, according to today's Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that thanks to a series of decrees issued by
the government, investors and tour operators have tasted the
atmosphere of security and safety in the country, and the tourism
industry has thus been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of 1996, a total of 2.5 million
tourists visited Egypt, a growth of 25.3 percent over the same
period of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian tourists accounted for a large part in the
growing tourist influx, registering an increase of 84.9 percent
and 63.7 percent respectively in July and August.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourist nights sold in the same period increased
by 22.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> China to Absorb 20 Billion US Dollars to Develop Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to absorb
foreign investment totalling 20 billion US dollars in the coming
five years to develop its power sector, according to vice-minister
of electric power Zhao Xizheng.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking official said in an interview with Xinhua
today that China is planning to invest 860 billion yuan (about 100
billion US dollars) in the remaining five years of the century to
develop the country's power sector, or an annual investment of 20
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In light of the target set by the central government for the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China will enhance its
total installed power generating capacity to 290 million kw, and
generate an annual electricity output of 1.4 trillion kwh by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal, China has to add an installed power
generating capacity of 14 million kw annually.
</P>
<P>
The senior official noted that one fifth of the needed funds
will come from foreign investment, and the other four fifths will
be undertaken by the central government and various localities.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign investors are welcome and encouraged to
co-develop the country's power sector, and they will find their
operations profitable in China.
</P>
<P>
As for returns on foreign investment, the director general of
the Ministry's Department of International Cooperation, Tan
Aixing, noted that no ceilings whatever have been set in this
regard, adding it will be decided by both sides in light of actual
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that despite the great achievements made
in China's power sector, the country's long-term power shortage
has not yet been alleviated fundamentally.
</P>
<P>
China expects to make big headway in power development through
vigorously expanding Sino-foreign cooperation in the sector.
</P>
<P>
China has set the goal of increasing its total installed power
generating capacity to 550 million kw by the year 2010, and
establishing a united nationwide power grid.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that he hopes friendly
cooperative relations between China and Syria in various areas
will be constantly promoted.

is satisfied with the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of Middle East, Qian said, as an important
country in the Middle East area, Syria is playing an important
role in solving the issue. According to the minister, peace in the
Middle East is not only conducive to the essential interests of
people of various countries in the area, but also to world peace
and development.
</P>
<P>
"China has always advocated that the issue of Middle East be
settled through political negotiation, on the basis of relevant UN
resolutions, and on the principle of exchanging land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Qian said, China supports Syria for its unremitting efforts in
solving the Middle East issue fairly and completely through
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
He said that every agreement reached through negotiation,
regarding the Middle East, should be respected and implemented
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Alloush conveyed Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh's regards
to Qian. He said since the two countries forged diplomatic
relations, Syria and China have enjoyed relations of cooperation,
collaboration and friendship, with broad prospects for further
development of the relations.
</P>
<P>
Syria appreciates China's stand of principle on the Middle East
issue, noted Alloush, adding that he hopes China will play a
bigger role in promoting peaceful talks in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
During his current China visit, Alloush also signed an
agreement on regular consultations between foreign ministries of
China and Syria, with his Chinese counterpart Tian Zengpei.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Gives up Third Term of Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani has said that he would not run for the third
term of presidency next year, a press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president, who has been in the office as
president for two consecutive terms, made the remarks in an
interview with the German Weekly Der Spiegel, which was
published by all local Persian dailies today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said: "There are talks about amendment to the
Constitution so I could be nominated for a third term. But I do
not deem such a measure necessary."
</P>
<P>
"I think there are people who can assume the
responsibility. There is no necessity of a change in our
Constitution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that there is only about 10 months left
before the next presidential elections in Iran. Certain political
groups are pressing to introduce their nominees for their
political interests.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of President Rafsanjani had tried very hard in
calling for a change in the Constitution in a bid to enable
Rafsanjani to have the third term.
</P>
<P>
However, their efforts have been blocked by Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei, who had made it clear that Rafsanjani would
serve the country in "other significant offices" following the
end of his term of office as president.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, what kind of future for Rafsanjani is still
unclear.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power to be Supplementary Energy in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China will use nuclear power as
a supplementary energy resource in its future economic
development, according to a report in the weekly magazine
"Outlook" published today.
</P>
<P>
This will help the country make up for a shortfall of 20-30
million kilowatts of generating capacity needed by the year of
2010, and also relax the tension in coal transport for thermal
power plants and reduce pollution, it said.
</P>
<P>
China is capable of developing nuclear energy and has an
abundant supply of nuclear fuel and uranium resource to sustain
nuclear power production.
</P>
<P>
The country has made major progress in the development of
nuclear power in its Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95).
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1994, a 300,000-kw generating unit went
into operation at the Qinshan power plant and two 900,000-kw units
at the Daya facility.
</P>
<P>
The three units had generated 28.99 billion kwh of electricity
by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to build four more nuclear power projects
with a designed generating capacity of 6.6 million kw in Zhejiang,
Guangdong and Liaoning in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Referring to controversial topics such as nuclear safety in
nuclear power generation, the report, written by an academician of
the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said China always gives top
priority to nuclear safety in the design, construction and
operation of nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
The report said the operation of the Qinshan and Daya Bay
nuclear power plants has not harmed the surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the disposal of radiative wastes, the report said
China is working on a project to treat highly and moderately
radioactive nuclear wastes, and is preparing to build four nuclear
disposal sites in Guangdong, in northwest China, and Zhejiang in
the east, and in southwest China.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Angolan War-Torn City of Huambo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Yin Yongjian)
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- This Xinhua correspondent has
visited the wartorn Angolan city of Huambo twice in the
past nearly three years. The two visits have impressed the
visitor quite differently.
</P>
<P>
Huambo, Angola's second largest city and a strategically
important place in the southern African country, has been
contested by the two warring parties during Angola's 20-year
civil war. In late 1992, when the civil war re-erupted, the
government forces and the troops of the then rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) fought there for as
many as 55 days. During the battle, some 10,000 people were
killed and many others fled, reducing the city's population from
500,000 to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the UNITA troops captured the city and had occupied
it until the government forces seized it in mid-November, l994.
</P>
<P>
The correspondent visited Huambo for the first time in December,
l993. At that time, what met the eye was a scene of devastation
everywhere in the city. Almost all the once-beautiful high
buildings had become ruins. Bullet holes and broken paned windows
were seen on the few others which were not completely destroyed
in the war fortunately. On the roads were numerous craters full
of rain water.
</P>
<P>
Because of the United Nations fuel embargo imposed on UNITA,
no cars could be found running in the city. Shops were closed and
production suspended. Even pedestrians could hardly seen on the
street. When night came, it fell into terrible darkness, due to
power failure. In practice, the city was in a deathly stillness.
</P>
<P>
Huamba was then isolated from the outside world, as its
communications lines were all cut.
</P>
<P>
The correspondent paid another visit to Huambo in early October
this year and found that some changes have taken place in the
war-torn city.
</P>
<P>
In front of the gate of the airport, stalls have mushroomed
around the parking lot, with vendors hawking various drinks,
vegetables, fruits and foods.
</P>
<P>
Along the highway from the airport to the downtown area, one
can see large numbers of UN peacekeepers from Brazil, India and
Zambia working near their camps. The craters on the highway have
been filled up. A World Food Program convoy loaded with relief
grain is rumbling to the city center.
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area, some previously-damaged buildings have
been innovated, though many others still lie in ruins, reminding
people of the war years. Filling stations have begun to supply
fuel and cars are queuing up for petrol. Shops have opened for
business with shoppers coming and going in stream. The city is
really regaining its former vitality and vigor.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, residents in the city can watch TV programs from the
Luanda-based Angola People's TV Station. While walking on the
street, lively melodies can be heard coming out of the houses. On
the street, many children are dancing cheerfully to the music. It
seems that they are not worried by the war.
</P>
<P>
However, it is a pity that industrial and agricultural
production in the city has not been resumed thus far. City
government officials say they have no sufficient fund to re-build
the factories destroyed by the war. And, countless mines are
still laid in the farmland, posing a threat to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale civil war is over in Angola after the
government and UNITA signed a peace accord in Lusaka, Zambia, on
November 20, l994. As peace process is going on steadily, it is
expected that the Angolan people will, in the near future, build
Huambo into a beautiful city where economy will develop rapidly.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Herdsmen in Inner Mongolia Develops Agricultural Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Herdsmen in one of China's
largest prairie areas have changed their ways of life and are
establishing farms after their herds munched their way through
thousands of acres of wild grassland.
</P>
<P>
It has seen the farmers in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in
north China, developing animal husbandry and agricultural areas,
instead of depending solely on grazing land as they have done for
generations.
</P>
<P>
The region's herdsmen used to raise animals on 88 million
hectares of grasslands, which account for over a quarter of the
total prairie areas in China.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years they have built new grazing farms on six
million ha of land for crop growing to alleviate the shortage of
grass caused by their extensive herds.
</P>
<P>
This year they gathered 16 billion kilograms of straw as a
supplement feed for their stocks, in addition to 13 billion kg of
grain from farming areas.
</P>
<P>
About 99 percent of the additional output of eggs, 82 percent
of meat, 71 percent of cashmere and 48 percent of milk, came from
the agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics recently issued by the State Statistical Bureau
show that the number of livestock raised in the region's farming
areas totalled 38 million this year, making up more than half of
the region's total.
</P>
<P>
So far, the added value yielded from animal husbandry in the
region's agricultural areas has risen to more than six billion
yuan, making up 71 percent of the region's total. And farmers' per
capita income has reached 1,300 yuan, 29.4 percent of which came
from animal husbandry.

<HEADLINE> Ewenki Hunters Make New Fortune From Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ewenkis, an ethnic group in
North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are known for
their traditional life-style as hunters.
</P>
<P>
In recent times, however, Ewenkis in Chabaqi Village of Hulun
Buir League, have given up hunting and turned to farming.
</P>
<P>
The transformation has proved a success, with the average
per-capita annual income increasing from less than 200 yuan to
2,196 yuan within the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The village, located in the southern valley of Dahinggan
Mountains, has a population of 220. In the past, due to outdated
modes of thinking and production, the villagers mainly depended on
government subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, they have set up their own farm, and engaged in
farming with the help of the government, trying hard to learn how
to switch from traditional hunting to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, they have been successful in the
transformation, and their cultivated land has increased to 333
hectares, while they have purchased 22 large agricultural machines.
</P>
<P>
At present, the total fixed assets of the village has reached
1.78 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Currently, they are building a beef-cattle feeding base, and a
flour feed-processing plant, and they are also planning to
increase the farming acreage to some 660 ha.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the average per-capita income of the Ewenkis villagers
is expected to hit 5,000 yuan annually.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Cracks Down on Illegal Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province has taken measures to curb illegal mining activities by
issuing more than 20 local regulations.
</P>
<P>
The province has also set up an administrative law-enforcing
team, with a strength of almost 1,000 personnel.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, rich in mineral resources, has over 3,700 mines owned by
the state, collectives and individuals, with a total of 220,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
The province turns out 64 million tons of minerals of 53
varieties a year, which make up half of the province's entire
industrial production value.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, some locals ignored laws stipulating that all
mineral reserves belong to the state, and a large amount of
mineral resources had been wasted or lost due to illegal and
random mining activities.
</P>
<P>
By enforcing the recently-issued laws, government departments
have stepped up their control, by strictly checking existing mines
and mining bodies, and have adopted a sound registration and
licensing system.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 illegal mining pits have been closed down and 1,200
tons of illegal products confiscated. Delayed levies and taxes,
worth 1.5 million yuan were collected from local miners.
</P>
<P>
Now, 98 percent of state mining companies and 91 percent of
village-run or privately-owned mining firms in the province have
obtained license for mining.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Strives for More Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, Zambia has
been making great efforts to attract more foreign investments for
its economic resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has abundant mineral, agricultural, tourism and human
resources but lacks fund to bring the natural and human resources
into full play.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1991, the Zambian government adopted an
investment act offering high incentives to foreign investors. In
1993 it worked out a new investment act offering more incentives.
For instance, investors can import capital agricultural and
mining equipment free of duty.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Investment Center, set up in 1992 to promote and
facilitate investment in Zambia, helps foreign investors find
business partners, provides consultancy services, approve
projects and offers services to accelerate the pre-investment
process.
</P>
<P>
Through its project monitoring activities, the center
identifies problems and makes proposals to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that some investors fail to implement
their stated projects and end up becoming traders in Zambia after
getting investment licenses, the center takes measures to screen
the briefcase investors and revokes their licenses. In the past
four years, a total of 41 licenses have been revoked.
</P>
<P>
Now foreign exchange control restrictions have already been
repealed, capital, profits and goods can move freely and profit
control has been lifted. The privatization process which began in
1992 provides more opportunities for investors.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has repeatedly reaffirmed that it will
maintain the conducive investment environment and not in any way
interfere in the operations of investors. To encourage inflow of
foreign investment, Zambia has given some international mining
corporations exploration and mining rights.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have been paid off. Foreign investments are
increasing dramatically in Zambia and the approved projects are
spread over the country's key economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are interested in Zambia's agricultural,
manufacturing and mining sectors. From 1993 to September this
year, Zambia approved nearly 1,000 projects with total
investments of over 900 million U.S. Dollars on implementation.
South Africa ranks first to be followeduring by Britain and India.
</P>
<P>
Peter Lintini, director of investment promotions of the
center, told Xinhua that Chinese investments are growing faster
than some others and the Chinese investments are very important
to Zambia. He expressed hope that more Chinese investors will put
money in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to last month, the agricultural sector alone
attracted investments of 290 million Dollars. Local companies
have secured external funds through the World Bank's projects for
the production of coffee and soya beanring.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the investments of licenses issued in
the manufacturing sector were valued over 300 million Dollars.
The investments have been largely channeled to expansion or
rehabilitation of the production facilities.
</P>
<P>
The investments of licenses issued in the mining sector were
estimated at 30 million Dollars. They came from large
international corporations carrying out exploitation work for
base metals. Almost 10 major international mining companies have
sent experts to the copper-producing country to explore
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
With the increased investments, more job opportunities have
been created for Zambians. In 1995 alone, the new projects were
expected to create 15,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The investment center has predicted that the foreign
investments will double this year compared with last year. More
foreign investors are likely to start business by the end of this
year than last year, according to the information of the center.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are interested not only in Zambia, but also
in other countries in the region. They enter Zambia first and
then enter other countries with Zambia as a springboard.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Buy Maize for Food Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
expected within the next two weeks to begin buying maize from
farmers with the 10 billion Kwacha (eight million US Dollars)
allocated to the Food Reserve Agency (FRA).
</P>
<P>
FRA has already hired contractors to do the job, the local
press today quoted Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Ministry
Permanent Secretary Austin Sichenga as revealing.
</P>
<P>
Sichenga said at the weekend that the maize will be bought in
tranches for the National Food Reserve and that second companies
have already been contracting for the job in the first tranche.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector which is supposed to market the
maize to work hard because the government is merely supplementing
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
FRA is allocated 12 billion Kwacha (9.6 million US Dollars) --
two billion for operation and 10 billion for maize marketing.

The injector is used to administer liquid medicines or
nutritional liquids directly into the trunks of trees. The method
can be used when the tree contracts a disease or lacks a specific
element.
</P>
<P>
The liquid transfers to the branches, twigs and leaves after
the injection.
</P>
<P>
The tool has been so far used for research on the prevention
and treatment of tree diseases and insect pests on over 10,000
fruit trees, elm and poplar trees that are very popular in north
China.
</P>
<P>
The newly invented machine has proved very effective, and can
save 30 to 50 percent of pesticide, and 80 percent of water in
comparison with ordinary spray methods.
</P>
<P>
The machine weighs nine kilograms, and it only takes two to
five minutes to inject a single tree.
</P>
<P>
The prevention and treatment of tree diseases are mainly
conducted by spraying pesticides on leaves and trunks of trees, or
burying chemicals around the roots of the trees.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Set Debt Ceilings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand is
expected to set ceilings for the country's external short- and
long-term debts soon in a bid to improve its management of loans,
especially short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
The ceilings will be set based on funding purposes, financing
demands, money-market liquidity, export earnings and lending
rates, according to central bank governor Rernchai Marakanond.
</P>
<P>
Once debts exceed the ceilings, borrowers will be subject to a
higher cost of funds, Rernchai was quoted as saying by local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will find proper levels of the ceilings for
long- and short-term debts to ensure the measures will not hurt
the country's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The measures will give the central bank a clearer picture of
Thailand's debts and enable the bank to prevent local interest
rates from becoming volatile, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Thai central bank will require foreign and
local banks to divide their borrowing terms into three levels --
less than one year, one year, and more than one year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also will require banks to prepare reports on
their short-term debts to help the bank to assess the results of
the measures.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Economic Growth Picks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth in Lebanon
is picking up again after a freeze following the April aggression
by Israel, according to a business weekly published here today.
</P>
<P>
Riad Salameh, governor of Lebanon's Central Bank, was quoted
by Eco News, the business weekly, as predicting that the average
economic growth rate will be between 3 and 4 percent in 1996 and
inflation will be less than 10 percent for the first time in many
years.
</P>
<P>
This improvement is attributed to "a rise in greater dollar
liquidity in the market caused by people saving their money
in Lebanese pounds instead of dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is also due to dramatic improvement in various economic
sectors, especially construction, the central bank governor
noted.
</P>
<P>
This was achieved despite unfavorable military and economic
conditions, the tense situation in south Lebanon, the stalled
Middle East peace process and the August-September national
elections in Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salameh said that the Lebanese pound continues to appreciate
against other currencies, and there is a abundant supply of
U.S. dollars in the quiet Lebanese monetary market.

<HEADLINE> German Enterprises Urged to Enlarge Overseas Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- German enterprises have been urged
to expand overseas markets, especially in areas with fast economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Hans-Olaf Henkel, President of the Federation of German
Industry, said in Koln over the weekend that although Germany is
the second largest exporter in the world after the United States,
some two-thirds of its products were exported to countries of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
"Germany should pay more attention to areas with rapid economic
development, and we should not give the whole Latin American
market to the U.S.," Henkel said at the German-Latin American
Economic Seminar.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Germany's economic growth is slower than that
of other countries in Europe whose economic development lags
behind other areas in the world.
</P>
<P>
The share of German exports in the world has dropped from 12
percent to 10 percent, Henkel said.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by economic integration, Latin America has become one of
the regions with rapid economic development, which has provided "a

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vote-Buying to Be Watched in Thailand's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- While as many as 14 political
parties in Thailand are busy allocating candidacy to their
members, many of the general voters see vote-buying as "a normal
thing."
</P>
<P>
Many people do not think there is anything wrong with
vote-buying and are ready to vote for the "buyers," according to
Sa-Gnuan Nitayaramphong, a Pollwatch official in charge of
election analysis and planning.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted by Pollwatch in 49 of the country's 76
provinces, 27 percent of the 345,000 respondents are ready to vote
for money.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that in the July 1995 general election, most
votes were sold at 200 baht (8 US dollars) and the price reached
800 baht (32 US dollars) in some areas.
</P>
<P>
For the upcoming election on November 17, Pollwatch, the
country's election supervising committee, is particularly worried
about the situation in some constituencies where competition would
be keen.
</P>
<P>
On top of the list for close watch are Bangkok Constituency 5
and some northern and northeastern provinces, which would be
keenly contested as candidates from different parties would be
posted in each constituency.
</P>
<P>
Although nearly all political parties have raised their voice
against vote-buying, none seemed to be serious enough to take
action to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
"While everyone else is paying to get himself elected, how can
I win if I alone abstain from the practice?" said one former MP.
</P>
<P>
In another poll, 71.7 percent of the respondents said they were
not sure whether the Interior Ministry, which oversees the general
election, would be able to prevent vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent wanted the Interior Ministry to set up
vote-buying suppression units.
</P>
<P>
Last year, units under the Central Investigation Bureau of
Thailand arrested two suspects with 11.4 million baht (456,000 US
dollars), who were believed to be engaged in vote-buying in Buri
Ram in Northeast Thailand, a few days before the July 2 election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 38.4 million eligible voters will elect 393 MPs next
month. Two more seats were added to Parliament because of
population growth in two provinces.

<HEADLINE> Links Between Earthquake, Changes of Hot Spring Temperature Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese earthquake experts
have discovered close links between major earthquakes and the
water and temperature levels of hot springs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yunqi, an earthquake expert, said in a recent interview
with Xinhua, that most of the hot springs near quake epicenters
show abnormal indicators in flow and temperature before major
earthquakes, as well as in places where hot water flows from the
rift point of a stratum.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery was made after research on a number of
earthquakes in the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China has rich hot spring resources, and the forming
of most of the hot springs are connected with movement of
structures.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, more than 2,000 hot springs nationwide
are used to observe changes in water flow and temperatures, as one
of the predictors for earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Wang said before the 1976 Yunnan Longling earthquake, which
measured 7.4 on the Richter scale, the Balazhang Hot Spring with
more than 500 mouths, located in an area over 10 kilometers away
from the earthquake center, showed changes. The usual water
temperature is 81 degrees, while it rose to 91 degrees one month
before the earthquake, and it dropped to 81 one week after the
quake.
</P>
<P>
In Luanxian County, a place not far from Tangshan, which was
hit by a devastating earthquake in 1976, the temperature of a
490-meter hot spring rose from 48 degrees to over 70 degrees weeks
before the Tangshan earthquake in which 240,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the temperature of some hot springs indicated a
drop and water flows were reduced before earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that most of the hot springs are located in
earthquake belts. They are usually distributed in the compound
area of a structure and turning part of a major structure.
</P>
<P>
Wang held that hot springs are good places for observing
pre-warnings of earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts Effective Measures to Control Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China's central government has
attached great attention to environmental problems caused by
energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
Effective anti-pollution programs have enabled the country to
make marked progress towards pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the central government's adoption of legal,
administrative, technical and economic means to carry out
comprehensive harnessing programs, the country's economic
development, energy exploitation and environmental protection has
stepped onto the road of coordinated development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference in Beijing today on China-European
Union Energy Cooperation, Wu Baozhong, head of the pollution
control division under the State Environmental Protection Bureau,
said that as coal holds a dominant position in China's energy
production and consumption, the country's sulfur dioxide and acid
rain pollution situation is acute.
</P>
<P>
"While developing the economy, the Chinese Government has paid
great attention to controlling sulfur dioxide and acid rain
pollution related with energy, and has worked out control measures
and relevant policies, rules and standards," said Wu, adding that
the efforts have produced positive effects for improving China's
environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the country's newly-revised "Laws on
Prevention and Treatment of Air Pollution" stipulates that acid
rain control areas, and sulfur dioxide control zones, should be
clearly designated, greatly solidifying the curbing of the two
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
China's Law on Electric Power also stipulates that in carrying
out power construction projects, production, and supply, it is
also necessary to protect the environment according to law, use
new technology, and reduce emissions of harmful particles.
</P>
<P>
The recent Coal Law clearly states that the state encourages
coal washing - a process of treatment for crude coal - selection
and processing, with the purpose of lowering sulfur content.
</P>
<P>
China has been trying every possible measure and means to
control the emission of sulfur dioxide from energy production and
consumption, including adjustment of industrial structure and
product mix, the adoption of sophisticated technology, lowering
per-unit product energy consumption, and popularization of clean
coal technology.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, China will make greater efforts to
adjust mine construction, and production layout, speed up the
development and construction of low-sulfur coal in central and
western China, and limit the exploitation of high-sulfur coal,
raising the proportion of the coal output of low-sulfur coal
production areas against the country's total coal output from 73.3
percent in 2000 from 70 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the country will redouble its efforts to
treat, select and process more coal, with the treatment ratio of
crude coal raised to 30 percent by the turn of the century, from
22 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, in the coming five years, China
will build 19 coal washing plants, and rebuild 16 existing coal
treatment factories.
</P>
<P>
China has started to control pollution by sulfur dioxide in
boilers of its numerous power stations and large industrial
boilers. An increasing number of power generating units have also
been installed with desulphurization equipment.
</P>
<P>
Technology for harnessing sulfur dioxide emitted from
medium-sized and small boilers, industrial kilns and furnaces, and
civilian cooking ovens is under active research and development,
and will soon be introduced on a wide-scale basis.

<P>
SEOUL, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam announced an information society strategy today, saying
the information and communications industry will be fostered as a
leading industry of the country in the 21st century.
</P>

percent, higher than that of Japan and the U.S., which stood at
27.2 percent and 29.3 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Color Printer Market Has Great Potentials to be Tapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The writing is on the wall for
black and white office printers in China.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of office automation, conventional
monochrome printers, which fail to meet the demands of modern
office affairs, will eventually be replaced by color printers,
according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Guo Wei, deputy general manager of Legend Holdings, said
that the world has entered a color era, which is gradually
replacing the monochrome epoch.
</P>
<P>
He added that an increasing number of people are building their
images based on color, so printing equipment will play a
significant future role.
</P>
<P>
Tim Thorsteinson, president of the Pacific Operations of
Tektronix Inc, a world leader in color printers, added that the
world printers market is valued at 40 billion US dollars, with
color printers currently claiming a market share of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the next 3-5 years, color printers will maintain an annual
growth rate of 55 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the needs, Tektronix recently signed an agreement
with Legend, granting Legend exclusive selling agency rights for
Tektronix color printers on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Thorsteinson said he was fairly confident in China, which is
impressive in all aspects, and has bright future.
</P>
<P>
Tektronix has so far established one wholely-owned company, a
product development center, and three joint ventures in China.
But according to Thorsteinson, the company will increase its
investment in China by a big margin in the near future in this
most promising market of Tektronix.

<HEADLINE> China, Largest Consumer of American Ginseng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China has become the third
largest ginseng producer in the world, after Canada and the United
States and the largest consumer of it.
</P>
<P>
The country originally started to plant American ginseng 20
years ago, and now has a total ginseng growing area of nearly four
million square meters. It produces more than 100 tons of dried
ginseng annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, a research team under the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences, started to study seed selection,
cultivation, diseases and processing methods of American ginseng.
</P>
<P>
The research reached advanced world levels, and has remarkably
contributed to the development of the American ginseng industry in
China, according to Yang Jixiang, a professor at Jilin
Agricultural University. The research has passed the appraisal of
an experts' committee headed by Yang.
</P>
<P>
The research team has determined for the first time in the
world, that the optimum water content in the soil during the full
growth period of ginseng is 80 percent, and the gross water demand
is 115 kg every sq m.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the research team has doubled the per unit output
to 2.6 kg every sq m by using a high-yield technique.
</P>
<P>
As the largest American ginseng consumer in the world, China is
consuming more than 60 percent of the world's total output.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Liquidate Shares in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Market sources here confirmed that the foreign investors took
advantage of the recent buoyancy in the market and made their way
back before the market started correcting itself following actions
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the market
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
The liquidation has created a pressure on the country's foreign
exchange reserve, which fell to 1.996 billion dollars from 2.09
billion dollars at the end of June, the Central Bangladesh Bank
(BB) said.
</P>
<P>
But some foreign bank sources said this is not a withdrawal
from the market and it was a normal phenomenon in share trading
and the investors are expected to come up with more investment
shortly.
</P>
<P>
The share market in Bangladesh started thriving after the new
government, which came to power on June 23,took a few market
liberalization steps.
</P>
<P>
The steps include lifting the lock-in restriction, exempting
sales of bonus shares from the capital gains tax and allowing
expatriate Bangladeshis to take up to 5 percent of the initial
public offerings.
</P>
<P>
However, the prices, which started easing since last Wednesday
after the SEC warned investors of risk in trading on rumors and
without verifying the economic fundamentals of companies, recorded
a major slide in the last two days due to the imposition of a
circuit breaker restricting price movement within 10 percent in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
The share prices rose on higher demand caused by an
unprecedented rise in the number of investors against the short
supply of shares to match the demand, an official of the Dhaka
Stock Exchange noted.
</P>
<P>
The demand-supply factors acted more in determining the prices
than those being cited by the SEC, he added.

BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will meet in
Malaysia on Friday to discuss Myanmar's request for an early
integration of the country into the group, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Thai Foreign Ministry sources, the meeting will
evaluate Myanmar's readiness for full membership of the ASEAN, but
a timetable is unlikely to be set for the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ASEAN foreign ministers, urged by the Philippines and
Thailand, reportedly agreed not to push for an early entry of
Myanmar which was favored by Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos reportedly said earlier this
month that the ASEAN's constructive engagement policy with Myanmar
might be reviewed in view of the country's recent crackdown on the
National League for Democracy party.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting to coordinate the ASEAN's stance on
regional issues will also evaluate progress made by Cambodia and
Laos for full membership in the ASEAN next year.
</P>
<P>
Topics like progress in implementing policies of the
Asia-Europe meeting, Mekong development projects and the ASEAN's
request for a nuclear weapons free zone treaty are also on the
agenda of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Repeal Indemnity Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
completed preliminary preparations for repealing the infamous
indemnity ordinance that blocked the trial of the killing of the
nation's father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib.
</P>
<P>
Mujib, the first president of Bangladesh and father of the
present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was killed along with his
wife and sons on August 15, 1975, in a bloody military coup.
</P>
<P>
In order to block any trial of the killing, an indemnity
ordinance was promulgated later by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed who
became president after the assassination of Mujib. The indemnity
ordinance was ratified by the 5th amendment to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
In August 1991, Mohammad Nasim, then an opposition Awami League
(AL) member of parliament and now the post and telecommunication
minister, submitted a draft bill to the then 5th parliament for
repealing the indemnity ordinance. But the bill was never tabled
in the house for consideration during the rule of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
After assuming power on June 23 this year, the AL government
formed a committee with experts from the Law Ministry in late
September to find out ways of repealing the indemnity ordinance,
paving the way for the trial of Mujib's assassination after 21
years.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the committee worked out a draft
bill for scrapping the law and the draft is to be tabled in the
next session of parliament, which is likely to be discussed at the
cabinet meeting today.

continue to blacklist a Canadian arms trading company, according
to military sources.
</P>
<P>
The supreme command and the armed forces will not buy any
weapons from the blacklisted Canadian firm, Hawkeye Intertrade,
during Mongkol's four-year tenure, the Bangkok Post today quoted
the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hawkeye Intertrade, representing General Motors' diesel
division of Canada in the five billion baht (200 million U.S.
dollars) contract to supply 295 armored personnel carriers, was
initially blacklisted earlier this year by the then Supreme
Commander Viroj Saengsnit, who retired from the top military post
last month and is now deputy defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The blacklist would remain as the Canadian firm, which lost out
to the French firm Giat Industries, is continuing to spread rumors
about the supreme command, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The company allegedly conducted a leaflet campaign accusing
Viroj of receiving a kickback from Giat, which won the first
bidding contest.

<HEADLINE> No Movement in Forming Coalition in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- There was little movement
today toward forming a coalition in New Zealand after the general
election on Saturday in which no party won a clear majority.
</P>
<P>
The National Party government, now playing the role of a
caretaker, held its regular cabinet meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
National leader Jim Bolger said the meeting spent some time
discussing the election campaign and the way voters reacted to
National.
</P>
<P>
Apart from receiving a call from ACT leader Richard Prebble in
which he pledged support for National, Bolger said he neither made
nor received any calls from leaders of other parties. ACT won
eight seats in the new 120-member parliament and shares the same
view on economic policies with National.
</P>
<P>
The Labour MPs also held a caucus meeting today which was
briefed on the broad approach the party will take toward a
coalition. But leader Helen Clark described the meeting as
primarily an opportunity to bid farewell to defeated Labour MPs
and welcome new comers.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear which way Winston Peters will jump. The
leader of New Zealand First now holds the key in deciding the
shape of the next government,
</P>
<P>
On Saturday's election, National won 44 seats and Labour 37.
Both will need support from the 17 New Zealand First MPs to form
a government.
</P>
<P>
But Peters seems to be in a no-hurry mood. He spent Sunday on a
boat on the sea and Clark failed to get through to him by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
The first move of New Zealand First is expected to come
tomorrow when its caucus meets for the first time. Peters said on
Saturday night that after the caucus meeting he would announce a
negotiating meeting to talk with other parties.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, National and Labour will hold their separate
caucus meetings to set their terms for the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ reported that now all parties agree that it could take at
least a month to complete the bargain process.

<HEADLINE> Excise Tax Considered for Pickup Trucks in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Buyers of pickup trucks in
Thailand may have to pay excise tax as the country's taxation
agencies are under pressure to find new sources of revenues, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Excise Department under the Finance Ministry is
re-considering the introduction of a five-percent excise tax on
pickups, which it said can no longer be classified as "cars for
the poor" as they are increasingly used to carry both people and
goods.
</P>
<P>
The exemption from excise tax for pickups is unfair to buyers
of passenger cars which are subject to excise taxes ranging from
32.5 to 45 percent based on their engine capacity, the newspapers
quoted officials of the department as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pickups in Thailand are now subject only to a seven-percent
value-added tax but exempted from excise tax.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the new policy might be opposed by auto
dealers who are currently suffering a slowdown in sales.
</P>
<P>
The Banharn government had earlier proposed the introduction of
the excise tax on pickups, but failed to put the policy through
because of a cool response from the related sectors.

BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai navy will continue to
push for the procurement of two attack-class submarines, said Navy
Commander-in-Chief Adm. Vijit Chamnankarn.
</P>
<P>
The submarine procurement plan had been shelved by the Banharn

Vijit, who replaced retiring Adm. Prajet Siridej as navy
commander this month, said the project is part of the navy's
development plan.
</P>
<P>
At his first press conference Sunday, Vijit said the navy will
stay away from politics but will continue to try to convince the
new government, to be formed after the November 17 general
election, of the necessity of procuring submarines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bangkok Post today quoted a source as saying
that a decision by a joint committee of the Supreme Command and
the Navy to buy 17 Stingray light tanks for the Marine Corps has
been rejected.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Accept Seventh Term: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian senior official
said he was sure that President Soeharto, whose current term ends
in 1998, will accept another five-year presidential term, the
Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I am certain that Mr. Soeharto is still ready and prepared for
re-election for Indonesia's next president," Deputy Chairman of
the Supreme Advisory Council Suhardiman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He described the 75-year-old Soeharto, now serving his sixth
consecutive five-year term as president of the world's fourth
most-populous nation, as the "most capable, acceptable" figure for
the presidency in the 1998 poll.
</P>
<P>
"If Soeharto is prepared (to be reelected), it is certain that
the People's Consultative Assembly will elect him," Suhardiman
said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has so far declined to make clear his intentions in
1998, saying he was leaving the issue to the People's Consultative
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, 124.7 million Indonesians in a
population of 196 million have registered to vote in the general
elections due in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
All the three political parties that are officially recognized
in Indonesia -- the United Development Party (PPP), the ruling
functional group Golkar, and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
-- will compete in the elections for 425 seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 75 seats of the parliament are to be filled by
members of the Indonesian armed forces appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members make up half of the seats in the People's
Consultative Assembly that will elect Indonesia's president and
vice president in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Austrians Vote for European Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Austria's ruling Social
Democratic Party (SDP) received 29.2 percent of the votes in the
elections today to fill the 21 seats allocated Austria in the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The vote brings the SDP seats in the parliament down from eight
to six.
</P>
<P>
The SDP was tipped by the People's Party (PP), which won 29.6
percent of the ballots giving it seven seats, while the Freedom
Party (FP) had a 27.6 percent vote, with six seats.
</P>
<P>
With only 67.2 percent of the eligible voters participating in
the election, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, chairman of the SDP,
attributed the loss of the party to the low turnout.
</P>
<P>
Many voters of the SDP didn't cast their ballots, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the results of election would not have much impact on
the work of the Austrian government, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a separate election for the municipal assembly of Vienna
today, the SDP lost its overall majority which it had enjoyed
since 1920. It gained 39.05 percent of the votes, followed by the
FP with about 27.98 percent and the PP with 15.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SDP will have 42 seats in the 100-seat assembly, followed
by the FP with 30 seats and the PP with 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
Some 5.8 million voters were eligible to vote in the first
Euro-poll held in Austria for the Strasbourg-based European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The number of seats are allocated to parties according to their
national popularity.

</P>
<P>

Malaysia, Philcomsat of the Philippines, Jabatan Telekom Brunei
Darussalam of Brunei and CAT of Thailand.

<P>
Each of the six operators previously leased satellite
transponders separately.
</P>

tansponders of Intelsat's satellite orbiting in the 174 degrees
