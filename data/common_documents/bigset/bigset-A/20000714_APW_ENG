   WARNER ROBINS, Ga. (AP) -- For more than a century, Sacred Harp
singing was one of the most popular forms of music in churches
throughout the rural South.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 years, the music -- which features several
standing vocalists taking turns leading the group from the center --
has practically disappeared. It's kept alive by small but loyal
groups who love the music.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way of life,'' said Raymond Hamrick, 84. ''Like any
music, it tends to take you out of your everyday problems. You're
with friends. There are people over the country that go every week.
They sing the same songs, but they still get the same charge out of
it they did 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The vocalists sing without any accompanying instruments -- not
even a harp. Many of the singers say that the human voice is ''The
Sacred Harp,'' which was also the title of a popular songbook
published in Georgia in 1844.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sacred Harp singing is attracting a new following on college
campuses and in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always look for a rebirth,'' said Hamrick, a singer and
composer, after a ''singing'' at the Pilgrim's Rest Primitive
Baptist Church near Warner Robins. ''Maybe it'll skip a generation
and then the young ones will get interested again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacred Harp is both a social and a musical event. The emphasis
is on participation, not performing. Participants refer to their
gatherings as ''singings'' or ''classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs, many of them composed during the late 1700s and early
1800s, have religious themes. Sacred Harp music is arranged in four
parts: bass, tenor, alto and a melody line known as treble. Men
sing bass, women sing alto and both sing tenor and treble,
providing six-voice harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   Sacred Harp is written with shaped notes that originated in
England in the 1600s. The note heads, representing mi-fa-sol-la of
the musical scale, have distinctive geometrical shapes that were
devised to facilitate sight reading.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 singers gathered at Pilgrim's Rest included people from
all walks of life. They started at about 10:30 a.m. and took a
break at noon to feast on covered dishes. After lunch, they sang
for another 90 minutes before heading home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's better than going to church,'' said Wesley Haley, 48, of
Jackson, who has been singing for 12 years. He was there with his
wife, Rita, and teen-age son, Timothy. Two daughters also sing.
''Sometimes you get into a spiritual mood that raises the hair on
the back of your neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Also among the singers were three sisters -- Rose Watson of
Yatesville and Mary Brownlee and Martha Harrell, both of
Barnesville.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came up with it,'' said Watson, a Macon bookkeeper. ''It's
just part of our life. We didn't have TV or radio for
entertainment. We got out the Sacred Harp book and sang.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our earliest memories, before we sang, was hearing our mother
and aunts singing on the front porch,'' said Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   The original Sacred Harp songbook was published in 1844 by
Benjamin F. White and E.J. King. The latest version of the book is
published by the Sacred Harp Publishing Co. in the west Georgia
town of Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   ''One-hundred-and-sixty years ago, we were in the rural South,''
said Hugh McGraw, 69, the company's secretary for 50 years. ''There
was farming going on. Papa and Mama had eight to 10 kids. They went
to singing schools. They went to singings on Sunday. That's played
out now. There's no rural South anymore. Everybody had to move to
town to make their livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw said the company has sold about 90,000 song books over
the past 30 years, some to customers in Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The older people are keeping it alive, but in these new towns
like Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle, it's the younger people
who are doing it,'' said McGraw. The song book features nine of his
songs and six of Hamrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three states host Sacred Harp conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that divides people, you leave at the door of a
singing, whether you're a Baptist, Methodist, Catholic or atheist,
and there are plenty of all of those at singings today, especially
outside the South,'' said Warren Steel, an assistant professor of
music and Southern culture at the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Steel, a singer and authority on the art, is encouraged by the
growth outside the South, but wonders whether that will be enough
to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In places like central Georgia, it's practically disappeared.
Those are the people who have generations of singers and
association. They're the ones who really carried the tradition,''
he said. ''The interest outside the South and in urbanized and
college towns is certainly there, but it remains to be seen how
pervasive it will be and whether it can be passed along.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers 5, Royals 2  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeromy Burnitz and Marquis Grissom hit
first-inning home runs and Jamey Wright won his fourth straight
road decision as the Milwaukee Brewers beat Kansas City Royals 5-2
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wright (5-2) gave up one run and eight hits in seven innings,
walking four and striking out three while leading the Brewers to
their fourth win in five games. He benefited from three double
plays and was handed a 4-0 lead before his first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's first four batters all scored against Blake Stein
(0-2), was making his second start after breaking a bone in his
right forearm during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 14th save in 18
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard singled leading off and Grissom homered into the
Brewers' bullpen. Geoff Jenkins walked and Burnitz followed with
his 18th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom's sacrifice fly made it 5-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Reboulet's RBI single in the seventh stopped an 0-for-19
skid. Mark Quinn homered in the eighth off David Weathers.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, after giving up five runs and six hits and two walks in
the first two innings, allowed just one hit and two walks in the
next four. In all he gave up five runs and seven hits in six
innings, striking out seven and walking three.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee turned double plays in the second, third and fourth,
raising their NL-leading total to 106. In the second, the Royals
had runners at first and third with no out when Dave McCarty lined
hard toward right field. But first baseman Tyler Houston made a
lunging catch and then stepped on the bag for the easy double play.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City loaded the bases with two out in the fifth but
Wright got Mike Sweeney to hit a weak grounder back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wright has pitched at least seven innings in six of his
last eight starts. ... The Royals' major league-leading total of
home runs allowed climbed to 148. ... Thursday was the 33rd wedding
anniversary of Royals manager Tony Muser. ... The Brewers are 5-5
against AL Central teams this year and 10-5 when Burnitz homers.
Burnitz has reached safely in 35 of his last 40 games. ... In an
18-game stretch in which the Royals play 15 at home, they are 4-9
thus far. ... C Jorge Fabregas got Jose Hernandez on a snap throw
to first to end the Brewers eighth.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 11, Yankees 9  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Lowell and Derek Lee hit three-run homers
off Orlando Hernandez as the Florida Marlins opened the second half
of the season by winning for the eighth time in 10 games, 11-9 over
the New York Yankees on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins (46-43), the worst team in baseball in 1998 and
1999, have more wins than the two-time defending World Series
champion Yankees (45-39).
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny (5-7) allowed three runs and six hits in five
laborious innings for his second win in 14 starts since April 23.
He needed 118 pitches to make it through five innings, but left the
bases loaded in the second and two runners on in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (8-7) was not able to avoid the big inning. In his
third start since returning from a minor elbow injury, Hernandez
allowed eight runs -- seven earned -- and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings.
The right-hander won his previous two starts, allowing only two
runs in 13 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque gave up more than that in the first inning. Mark Kotsay
singled with one out and Cliff Floyd followed with a walk. With two
outs, Lowell hit a shot into the left-field seats for his 13th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, a former top Yankees prospect, was traded to Florida
before last season because Scott Brosius was entrenched at third
base for New York. Lowell's homer -- coming one day after the
Yankees traded four minor leaguers to Cincinnati for left-hander
Denny Neagle -- was a reminder of the peril of trading prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Lee homered in the third inning, his 19th of the season and 11th
in the last 27 games, to give Florida a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees closed to 6-3 in the bottom half on an RBI single by
David Justice and a sacrifice fly by Jorge Posada. Ryan Thompson,
called up from Triple-A Columbus earlier in the day, then struck
out swinging with runners on second and third, ending the threat.
Thompson had an RBI double in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored two more in the sixth to knock out Hernandez.
Luis Castillo, who came into the game with four RBIs in 260
at-bats, had an RBI infield single and a second run scored when
shortstop Derek Jeter threw the ball away for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit a solo homer in the sixth for the Yankees before
Florida added two more in the seventh off Craig Dingman. Yankees
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch left the game that inning with a
bruised left wrist after being hit by a line drive by Preston
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   New York closed to 10-6 in the seventh when Posada and Thompson
walked with the bases loaded off Armando Almanza and Braden Looper,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay singled in the eighth and moved around the bases on three
wild pitches -- one by Randy Choate and two by Jason Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees scored three in the eighth on an RBI single by
Justice and a two-run single by Tino Martinez before Antonio
Alfonseca came in and got Jorge Posada to pop out. Alfonseca
finished for his major league-leading 29th save in 32 chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Penny had been winless in five decisions on the road. ...
Wilson tied his career high with two stolen bases. ... The Marlins
are a major league-leading 38-24 record in interleague play. ...
Hernandez is 1-6 with a 6.33 ERA at home. ... Justice, who came
into the game 4-for-26 as a Yankee, went 3-for-5 with two RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Indians 4, Pirates 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By M.R. KROPKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez homered in his return from the
disabled list and Kenny Lofton singled home the winning run in the
10th inning Thursday night, leading the Cleveland Indians over the
Pittsburgh Pirates 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who didn't start in the All-Star game because of the
injury, went 2-for-4 in his first game since May 29, when he
strained his left hamstring running to first base against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out in the first and homered in the fourth, a 419-foot
drive to left-center off Todd Ritchie. Ramirez left for a pinch
runner in the eighth after a bloop single to left.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-all in the 10th, Richie Sexson doubled off
Scott Sauerbeck (3-1) leading off and took third on Enrique
Wilson's sacrifice. One out later, Travis Fryman was intentionally
walked and Jolbert Cabrera walked unintentionally, loading the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton singled to center, the ball just getting by the
outreached glove of outfielder Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay (2-5) pitched a scoreless 10th for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh went ahead in the second on John Vander Wal's RBI
single, but Roberto Alomar's run-scoring grounder tied it in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles, in his first appearance at Jacobs Field since
Cleveland traded him after the 1998 season, put the Pirates back
ahead with an RBI single in the fourth, but Ramirez's two-run shot
in the bottom half, his 14th homer of the season, gave the Indians
a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal walked in the seventh, took second on a grounder and
scored on a pair of wild pitches by Dave Burba, who allowed three
runs and seven hits in seven innings. Ritchie gave up three runs
and six hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ricky Ledee, acquired by the Indians from the Yankees on
June 29 for David Justice, switched his uniform number from 22 to
23, which is the number Justice had worn in Cleveland. ... Giles,
for the most part a backup outfielder when he was with the Indians,
has 60 home runs and 188 RBIs in 228 games with the Pirates. ...
Jason Kendall, Pittsburgh's All-Star catcher, went 3-for-4 and has
reached base safely in 75 of 80 games he has started.

<HEADLINE> Twins 5, Cubs 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Brad Radke won at home for the first time in
almost a month, and Jacque Jones hit a two-run homer as the
Minnesota Twins defeated the Chicago Cubs 5-1 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' team-leading 14th homer in the second inning gave
Minnesota the lead for good, and Radke (6-10) gave up five hits and
one run in six innings to earn his first Metrodome win since June
16.
</P>
<P>
   Radke, who signed a four-year extension with the Twins last
week, walked two and struck out three. LaTroy Hawkins got the final
out for his fifth save in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs starter Ismael Valdes (1-3) worked into the sixth inning,
when Minnesota made it 3-1 on Ron Coomer's leadoff double, a walk,
and Chad Allen's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Allen made the game's key defensive play as well. With Chicago
trailing 2-1, slugger Sammy Sosa led off the sixth with a walk.
Allen, playing his first game at right field in the Metrodome, made
a leaping catch at the wall to rob Henry Rodriguez of an extra-base
hit and hold Sosa at first.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit a bloop single in the eighth to finish 1-for-3, much to
the dismay of many in the crowd of 24,161 who came to see the fan
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's only run came in the fourth. Mark Grace drew a leadoff
walk and advanced to second on Radke's wild pitch. Sosa struck out
swinging after being ahead 3-0 in the count, but Rodriguez's single
scored Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota added another run in the seventh off Cubs reliever
Steven Rain. Jay Canizaro singled with one out, advanced on a
single by Matt Lawton and scored on Coomer's single.
</P>
<P>
   Cristian Guzman added a two-out RBI single in the eighth off
former Twins closer Rick Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It wasn't exactly the three tenors, but Minnesota baseball
legends Kent Hrbek and Tony Oliva joined Governor Jesse Ventura to
sing ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during the seventh-inning
stretch. Ventura performed the song at Wrigley Field earlier in the
season. ... Lights were low as the Twins and Cubs took batting
practice Thursday night. With temperatures near 90 in Minneapolis
and power use at a peak because of all the air conditioners
running, the city asked the Metrodome to keep the lights down until
gametime in an effort to conserve energy. ... Aguilera was honored
before the game for becoming the 13th pitcher to reach the 300-save
plateau. Aguilera, who spent 10 seasons in Minnesota, has 306
career saves -- 254 with the Twins. ... After winning two in a row
heading into the All-Star break, the Cubs failed to equal their
season-best winning streak. Chicago has won three in a row three
times this season.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Ashby Knows Orioles  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Andy Ashby, obtained by Atlanta in a trade with
Philadelphia, will make his debut with the Braves against the
Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game marks a new beginning for the right-hander, who
struggled with the Philadelphia Phillies while fully expecting to
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to be here,'' Ashby said Thursday, a day after the
Braves acquired him. ''It's a relief knowing everything is over
with now.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to helping the Braves maintain their hold on
first place in the NL East, and hopes to learn a thing or two from
new teammates Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the main thing is to every day go out and be able to
sit on the bench and watch these guys pitch. There are going to be
little things I can pick up by watching them pitch, and it's going
to help,'' he said. ''It's going to be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   His start Friday will mark the third time this season Ashby has
faced the Orioles. He experienced mixed success with the Phillies --
he gave up seven runs in 6 2-3 innings on June 11 at Camden Yards
before limiting Baltimore to one earned run in eight innings at The
Vet on July 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''The memories I have in this park from last time aren't the
same as the ones I have of pitching against them at home,'' he
said. ''When I threw against them here, I got the ball up. You do
that here, you're going to get hit. Tomorrow, hopefully I can pitch
instead of just throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was delighted to go from the last-place Phillies to the
division-leading Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a weird couple of days,'' he said. ''I just want to
give us a chance to win.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 13, White Sox 5  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Losing Big Mac didn't slow the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes pitched seven strong innings, Fernando Tatis homered
twice and Shawon Dunston hit a grand slam as the Cardinals routed
the Chicago White Sox 13-5 Thursday night in an interleague matchup
of division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, the major league home run leader with 30, went on
the 15-day disabled list before the game with tendinitis in his
right knee, just as the Cardinals were beginning their season-long
11-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals more than compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Benes (10-3) won his sixth straight decision, allowing nine hits
and two runs, and Edgar Renteria hit his 11th homer for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who lost their last two games before the All-Star
break to the Cubs, have their first three-game losing streak since
May 5-8.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria, the game's second batter, hit a solo shot off Mike
Sirotka (8-7), and one out later Tatis also went deep to give the
Cards a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis had an RBI single and Ray Lankford a two-run double
in the third, and Tatis added his 10th homer -- a two-run shot after
a walk to Jim Edmonds -- to make it 7-0 in the fourth and finish
Sirotka. Dunston doubled in the fifth and when White Sox outfielder
Carlos Lee bobbled the ball, Mike Matheny, who singled, scored all
the way from first.
</P>
<P>
   Two singles and a walk loaded the bases in the seventh and
finished Kevin Beirne. Dunston, the former Chicago Cubs shortstop,
then greeted Jesus Pena with a grand slam to make it 12-1. Edmonds'
sacrifice fly made it 13-1.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka, who won five of his previous six decisions, allowed
eight hits and seven runs in 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko's RBI single in the sixth spoiled Benes' shutout,
and Jose Valentin had a run-scoring single in the seventh. Chris
Singleton homered off Mike James in the eighth. Mark Johnson scored
on Heathcliff Slocumb's wild pitch and Valentin added a sacrifice
fly in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGwire was put on the DL retroactive to July 7. He missed
the Cards' last three games before the break as well as the
All-Star game itself. ... St. Louis leads the majors with 153
homers. The Cardinals have homered in 72 of their 88 games,
including 25 games with at least three homers. ... Dunston's grand
slam was the fifth of his career and second this season. He also
hit one May 30 at Arizona. ... Tatis has six career multihomer
games, his previous on Sept. 26, 1999, at Cincinnati. ... The White
Sox dropped to 8-5 in interleague play, while the Cardinals are
5-5.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch left the New York Yankees' game
against the Florida Marlins in the seventh inning on Thursday night
with a bruised left wrist after being hit by a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   With no outs in the seventh, Preston Wilson hit a line drive
toward second base. Knoblauch jumped too high for the ball, which
ricocheted off his left forearm and into center field for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who missed seven games earlier this season with
soreness in his left forearm also bruised his left thumb on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''The injury is a problem, because that left wrist keeps getting
it,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative and Knoblauch was scheduled to undergo a CT
scan on Friday. He is listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has had trouble in the field all year, making 15
errors in the first half of the season. He fielded his only two
chances Thursday flawlessly.

<HEADLINE> Reds 15, Rockies 6  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit a pair of two-run homers and
the Cincinnati Reds handed Colorado a rare home loss with a 15-6
victory over the Rockies on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, whose 30 homers tied Mark McGwire for the major league
lead, also scored four times in recording his 45th career
multihomer game and his fifth this season. Griffey has 12 RBIs in
his last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey, Barry Larkin and Pokey Reese added homers as the
Reds extended Colorado's season-worst losing streak to eight. The
Rockies dropped to 28-10 at Coors Field this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared in the eighth after Reds starter Elmer Dessens
(2-0) grazed Larry Walker with a pitch. Walker started toward the
mound and both teams emerged from their dugouts, but no punches
were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Buddy Bell was ejected after arguing with umpire
Dana DeMuth. Bell felt Walker was hit in retaliation for Colorado
starter Pedro Astacio (7-6) hitting Griffey in the back in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado reliever Jose Jimenez was ejected in the ninth after
hitting Ed Taubensee, but no players left their dugouts.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a big lead early, Dessens gave up six runs and nine
hits in a career-high 7 1-3 innings. He didn't allow a runner past
first base until Todd Helton doubled with one out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio struggled from the start, allowing Griffey's 29th homer
of the season in the first. Astacio matched a career-high by
surrendering 10 earned runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds added four runs in the third on Dante Bichette's RBI
single and a two-out, bases-loaded double by Dmitri Young. The
rally began when Dessens singled for his third career hit.
</P>
<P>
   Casey made it 8-0 in the fifth with a two-run homer, his sixth.
Larkin added a two-run shot in the sixth. Reese added a two-run
homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado finally broke through against Dessens in the seventh as
Jeffrey Hammonds and Brent Mayne had RBI singles and Neifi Perez
hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hit a long home run to center field off Julian Tavarez
in the eighth, and the Rockies responded with a two-run double by
Helton and an RBI groundout by Brent Mayne in their half.
</P>
<P>
   Reds third baseman Chris Stynes was 3-for-4, scoring four runs.
Stynes reinforced his status as the top hitter in Coors Field
history. Stynes is 29-for-55 (.527) at Coors.
</P>
<P>
Notes: For the second time this season, Bell was in the position
of managing against a son. He faced David Bell when the Rockies
played the Seattle Mariners and looked across the field at Mike
Bell on Thursday. Mike Bell is still seeking his major league debut
for the Reds. ... Rockies 3B Jeff Cirillo held a pregame news
conference to announce a four-year contract extention that includes
a team option for 2006. ... Bichette played for the first time
since July 5. He missed three straight games with a bruised left
shin. ... Larkin ended a 15-game RBI drought. ... Griffey's homer
was his 427th, moving him past Billy Williams for 26th on the
career list.

<HEADLINE> Lane's Death Leaves Opening on Colts  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- Fred Lane was only a member of the
Indianapolis Colts for less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting death of the career leading rusher for the Carolina
Panthers left coach Jim Mora wondering who would be his backup
running back as the Colts opened training camp Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, obtained in an April trade with Carolina, had been
impressive in mini-camp and summer workouts with his new team. Last
week, Lane was fatally shot at his Charlotte home following an
argument with his 25-year-old wife, Deidra. No charges have been
filed in the shooting, which police say occurred in an apparent
domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fred was an excellent addition. We really liked what we saw of
Freddie,'' Mora said. ''It's just a shame that the tragedy had to
happen. He was going to play a lot for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts were looking to Lane to provide some relief for
Edgerrin James, the NFL's rushing leader with 1,553 yards, who also
had 62 receptions for another 586 yards, while scoring 17
touchdowns as a rookie last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a good football player that had been very productive in
the league and he looked very impressive here,'' Mora said of Lane.
''He was a guy you could put in a game and feel comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora isn't sure who will assume Lane's role.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking into finding somebody to add to the roster,''
Mora said. ''We're investigating the possibility of bringing in a
veteran player.''
</P>
<P>
   SportsLine.com reported Thursday night that the Colts have
agreed to terms with Karim Abdul-Jabbar, the former UCLA running
back who spent four seasons with Miami.

   PHOENIX (AP)-- Brandy Reed had 25 points, 10 rebounds and five
assists as the Phoenix Mercury defeated the Sacramento Monarchs
72-64 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the fourth straight for the Mercury, who have
four players out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, upset because she wasn't picked as a reserve by the
league's coaches for Monday's WNBA All-Star Game in Phoenix, hit 10
of 18 shots from the field. She also blocked a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Edwards added 17 points for the Mercury. Sacramento was
led by Kedra Holland-Corn with 19 points and Yolanda Griffith had
16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury led 63-59 with 4:06 remaining before going on a 9-4
run to close the game. Reed scored four points during the final run
and Lisa Harrison hit a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix scored the final 11 points of the first half to lead
38-30 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury widened their lead to 12 points early in the second
half before Holland-Corn got the Monrachs back in the game.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Lure Joyner-Kersee Back  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The chance to compete in a fifth
Olympic Games was enough to lure Jackie Joyner-Kersee, arguably the
greatest female athlete of her time, out of her two-year
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old winner of six Olympic medals, three of them
gold, will compete in the long jump preliminaries Friday in the
U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, appearing alongside her husband and coach, Bob
Kersee, at a news conference Thursday, said she enjoyed retirement
immensely and never missed the competition. But she and her husband
knew that she has enough left to make it to the Olympics one more
time.
</P>
<P>
   Long jumper and sprinter Willye White is the only American woman
to compete in track and field in five Olympics. She did it from
1956-72.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, who holds the American record in the long jump
and world record in the heptathlon, has not made a full-approach
jump since she walked off the track in her farewell appearance in
Edwardsville, Ill., on July 26, 1998. Her workouts have consisted
solely of short-approach jumps, conditioning and technique
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative plans for competing in a meet in Long Beach, Calif.,
June 10 were scrubbed because of a sore Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Her first preliminary jump Friday will be her first jump
anywhere in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Her competition will include Marion Jones, the charismatic
sprinter and jumper whose goal is to win five gold medals in
Sydney. The long jump is Jones' weakest event, but Joyner-Kersee
said she is not aiming to beat anyone, just to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, whose American record of 24 feet, 7 inches has
stood since 1994, said she doesn't have a specific distance in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a competitor. I'm a long jumper right now,'' Joyner-Kersee
said. ''I'm going to get in there and do my best. I don't want to
underestimate anyone. I don't want to underestimate myself. I
really don't know, but I do know that I'm healthy and I'll try to
execute the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her return to the sport, there has been the constant,
usually good-natured bickering, that has long been a part of her
relationship with her husband, who has coached such Olympic greats
as the late Florence Griffith-Joyner and Gail Devers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to find out if a 38-year-old woman as talented as
Jackie can jump over 22 feet, which probably would make the team,
and make five Olympic teams,'' her husband said. ''There's one
story to me here, and that's whether or not Jackie Joyner-Kersee
can make five Olympic teams. Beating Marion and Dawn Burrell or
whoever, that doesn't matter. What counts is being in the top
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee said she ''was kind of relieved'' when she walked
off that track two years go. She has worked to establish her
charitable foundation, has worked with asthmatic athletes and kept
herself and her friends in shape in what she calls her ''everyday
people workout.''
</P>
<P>
   Her return was the idea of both her and her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was as close to 50-50 as anything we've done,'' Kersee
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were times she didn't want to do it. She thought her
husband's approach was not tough enough at times, and at other
times she just wanted to give up.
</P>
<P>
   The second week in April, disgusted with her workout, she told
Kersee ''I don't have to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'You're right,''' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   She picked up her clothes and went home. A week later, she was
back, those five Olympic appearances driving her once again. After
all, the long jump was much less grueling than the heptathlon had
been.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'All right, I only have to do it for 30 meters,''' she
said. '''Can I discipline myself to go 30 meters?' That sounds
pretty simple, but you never know.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kaitlin Sandino and Ryk Neethling of South
Africa repeated as 800-meter freestyle champions at the Janet Evans
Invitational swimming meet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno, 17, was timed in 8 minutes, 38.66 seconds, with 1996
Olympian Claudia Poll of Costa Rica second in 8:40.70. Kalyn Keller
was third in 8:47.39.
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno, who won the event a year ago in 8:36.21, was happy with
her performance after dealing with shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   ''My stroke was really good and the time was really great,'' she
said. ''It feels great to be back in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Neethling, who swims for the University of Arizona, was timed in
8:06.46, overtaking Southern Cal sophomore Erik Vendt in the final
100 meters. Vendt finished second in 8:08.09. Neethling set a meet
record of 8:01.36 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really like to race against Erik. We had a great race at the
NCAAs,'' said Neethling, defeated by Vendt at 1,500 meters at this
year's collegiate championship.
</P>
<P>
   The meet, a major tuneup for the U.S. Olympic trials, continues
Friday through Sunday at the McDonald's Swim Stadium, with five
events each day.

<HEADLINE> PBS Looks To Shake Up Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Public television fans might have to do
without ''Masterpiece Theatre'' on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   PBS has long adhered to tradition in scheduling, leaving series
in place for decades. But the lineup at seven public TV stations is
being shaken up this fall in a test aimed at finding more
competitive ways to air shows.
</P>
<P>
   The results could bring a new national schedule as early as
April 2001, PBS executives told the Television Critics Association
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Taking ''Masterpiece Theatre'' away from the Sunday lineup was
cited as one possibility, though it could be a shock to PBS
viewers. The drama series has held Sunday court for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're willing to take risks. ... They may not all work, but
we're willing to do that,'' said PBS President Pat Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   PBS also will look at teaming programs more effectively, maybe
pairing shows like ''The American Experience'' and ''American
Masters,'' both biography-type nonfiction, said John Wilson, senior
vice president for PBS Programming Services.
</P>
<P>
   PBS stations in the pilot project will be WMFE in Orlando, Fla.;
WQED Pittsburgh; WHYY Philadelphia; GPTV Atlanta; KUED Salt Lake
City; WVIZ Cleveland and KPBS San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the seven stations represent 10 percent of U.S. TV
households.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell also announced that PBS will join National Public Radio
to create a guide for voters before the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time to Choose: A PBS/NPR Voter's Guide,'' a live, three-hour
broadcast on Nov. 1, will examine the issues before voters. Jim
Lehrer of PBS' ''The Newshour'' will anchor the broadcast to air on
PBS and NPR.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who took over as president and chief executive officer
in May, said she wants to see ''more live, more vital'' programming
on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   She said a summit with educational, artistic and media leaders
would be held soon in Utah to brainstorm on new approaches. Three
programming executives, in Los Angeles, Miami and in the Midwest
are being added to PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was asked if there was continuing fallout from the sale
and swapping of PBS station membership lists to political groups.
That occurred under her predecessor, Ervin S. Duggan.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, which drew harsh criticism, did not have a
significant impact on membership, Mitchell replied, adding ''I
don't think you'll see those kinds of issues arise again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress used the episode to renew questions about
publicly funded TV, but Mitchell noted that a recent attempt to
reduce money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was
soundly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming programs announced by PBS include ''The Blues,'' a
documentary series with Martin Scorsese as executive producer and
with directors including Spike Lee and Wim Wenders, and a
bioengineering program, ''Beyond Human.''

<HEADLINE> Newspaper reports identity of man patted down by Whitman  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The man Gov. Christie Whitman was
photographed patting down on a Camden street four years ago has
been identified as a 21-year-old who is now in jail on drug
charges, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman searched Sherron ''Ron G'' Rolax, who was 17 at the time
of the incident, the Star-Ledger reported in Friday's edition.
Rolax refused to comment Thursday, but his uncle, Anthony English,
confirmed that the 21-year-old told him about the incident,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Quayson Davis, 19, told The Star-Ledger that he was with Rolax
and a group of young black men on the corner of Lansdowne Avenue
and Rose Street when Whitman and six state troopers pulled up in
vans. The governor was patrolling Camden streets as part of
crackdown on crime in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the men were rounded up by the troopers and told to
stand with their palms against the side of a building while they
were frisked.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers told the newspaper the governor was then urged to pose
for a photograph while patting one of them down and she agreed.
Davis said Rolax was the last man in line at the wall and was
patted down by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a copy of the photograph obtained by The Associated Press,
Whitman is seen standing behind the man, his hands are spread out,
palms pressed against a wall. In the photograph, Whitman appears to
be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Rolax was not arrested that night. He is now in the Mountainview
Youth Correctional Facility in Annandale on 1998 drug charges,
according to The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Many claim Whitman's search was illegal, and civil rights
activists are planning protests where they will display a
photograph of that search.
</P>
<P>
   A ''major rally'' is planned during the Republican convention in
Philadelphia at the end of the month, and the Whitman photograph is
among the issues to be raised, the Rev. Al Sharpton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in my judgment an outrage that a young person who had
already been frisked, who was known to have no drugs and had not
done anything illegal, to then be made a racial prop for a photo op
for the governor, and she do so gleefully, with a smile on her
face,'' said Sharpton, head of the National Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he would be preaching on the topic Sunday in
Newark and the following Sunday in Teaneck. ''Mrs. Whitman needs to
know she can run but she can't hide,'' said Sharpton, of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the State Police superintendent later fired by Gov.
Christie Whitman now claims the attorney general and the governor's
chief of staff were present the night she searched the Camden man.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman joined state troopers, city police and members of the
Camden County Prosecutor's Office twice in 1996 for tours of city
crime scenes, Carl Williams told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Whitman in the police van on March 28 and May 8 were
Deborah T. Poritz, then the state attorney general; and Peter G.
Verniero, Whitman's chief of staff, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Poritz is now the chief justice of the state Supreme Court;
Verniero is an associate justice. Both were appointed by Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman on Thursday denied they were along, as did a Supreme
Court spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Williams is wrong,'' Winnie Comfort said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero was not in Camden either night and Poritz was there
only once, Comfort said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She did not accompany the governor the night the recently
published photograph was taken,'' Comfort said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has said several times that she did not think before
putting her hands on the man. Whitman says she accepted because she
felt it was her duty to experience all areas of police work.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Thursday he opposed Whitman's visit to Camden, but
was powerless to keep her off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not my idea for the governor to do this. I was against
it. I was gravely concerned,'' he said. ''She's the governor. She's
the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has repeatedly rejected any attempt to associate
her search with the practice of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman asked Williams to resign in February 1999 after a The
Star-Ledger published comments he made about police practicing
racial profiling, or stopping motorists based on their race.
</P>
<P>
   Now Williams says the governor should apologize for the search,
something she never should have done.
</P>
<P>
   ''She should apologize. I think it was a very insensitive thing
to do. I think an apology is in order,'' said Williams, who met
reporters in his lawyer's office. ''Definitely an apology to the
New Jersey State Police for putting them into this situation again.
It looks like our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Superior Court judge dismissed Williams'
discrimination lawsuit that claimed Whitman, Verniero and other
officials improperly asked for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he remained at a command post while Whitman and
her top associates patrolled Camden in a police van. He said he was
not present when a trooper snapped a photograph of Whitman patting
down the man.
</P>
<P>
   Both Williams and Whitman denied charges that a State Police
supervisor offered a week's vacation for the trooper who
photographed the governor with a black suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''That to me is a ludicrous statement. There is no way possible
someone can give extra vacation,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Clifford Van Syoc, said he plans to ask the judge to
reconsider her decision next week.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr. declined Thursday to
comment on the legality of the search, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general believes it would be inappropriate to
address the question of illegality at this point,'' Chuck Davis
said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules in School Shooting Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- The parents of a teen-ager who opened fire
in the lobby of his western Kentucky high school have been
dismissed from a civil lawsuit brought by the parents of three
girls slain in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling by Chief Regional Circuit Judge Will Shadoan
leaves Michael Carneal, 16, as the sole defendant in the $120
million civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen all the evidence and there is nothing in there to
indicate that his parents could have foreseen that this child was
capable of such a violent act,'' Shadoan said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moore, the attorney for John and Ann Carneal, said, ''I
think every jurisdiction in the country would have ruled the exact
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the slain students still plan to move forward
with the suit, scheduled for court Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot more important now that the correct message is
sent. All the money in the world could not reimburse us for the
loss of our daughter,'' said Sabrina Steger, who daughter Kayce
Steger was one of the three students killed in the shooting Dec. 1,
1997. Five other students in the group that was praying when
Carneal, then 14, opened fire, were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal pleaded guilty to three counts of murder in 1998 and was
sentenced to at least 25 years in prison.

   TIERRA AMARILLA, N.M. (AP) -- A judge on Thursday declared a
mistrial in the case of a man accused of abducting and sexually
torturing a Colorado woman four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   David Parker Ray, 60, will remain jailed as he awaits trial on
similar charges involving two other women allegedly held against
their will in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, a former mechanic at a state park, was arrested in 1999
after a woman escaped from his mobile home and ran to a neighbor's
home wearing only a padlocked collar.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched Ray's trailer and found torture devices,
including surgical tools and chemicals, as well as video cameras.
Eventually two other victims were identified by police, including
the Colorado woman.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Neil Mertz said Thursday the jurors deliberated
for 8&AMP;frac12; hours on the Colorado woman's case but couldn't agree on any
of the 12 counts against Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed,'' District Attorney Ron Lopez said. He
said the prosecution plans to retry Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Ray showed no reaction. His attorney, Jeff Rein, said, ''It's
clear that the jury paid attention to the evidence.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyes Quick Budget Deal  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans said Thursday they
want to reach a quick compromise with President Clinton on the
year's biggest spending bill. The hope is to avoid a
campaign-season showdown over schools and other popular issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door meeting, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told the chairmen
of the two chambers' appropriations committees to try striking a
deal with the White House next week, participants said. The
measure, which exceeds $340 billion, covers the Departments of
Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is perennially one of the last of the 13 spending bills
completed -- usually after the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year --
because it is a battlefield over education, workplace safety and
other highly politicized, difficult issues. Republicans are eager
to get those fights resolved before they can become a focus of the
November presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. said
the instructions the leadership gave were ''to try to get what
would be a signable bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can get this bill to the president before the politics
starts, we'll have a working relationship'' with the White House
that could speed completion of the other spending bills, said his
Senate counterpart, Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has signed just one of the 13 spending bills for
fiscal 2001 into law.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci said
administration officials were ''always happy'' to meet with
lawmakers from both parties and both houses working on spending
issues, but signaled that reaching a deal could be tough.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci said Clinton's ''key priorities'' for hiring teachers,
refurbishing schools, health care and labor issues would have to be
met. She also said Clinton wanted what is called a ''clean bill,''
meaning a measure without extraneous amendments, and one that would
leave enough money for his proposals in later measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on what we've seen to date, there's a long road to
travel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto both the House- and Senate-passed
versions of the bill because of cuts in his proposals for teachers,
school repairs and social services grants to states. The bills
would also block planned administration regulations aimed at
reducing workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats were jubilant when the GOP pushed the bill
through the House last month, saying its cuts would help Democrats
capture control of a chamber Republicans now govern with an 11-seat
majority. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., top Democrat on the House
appropriations panel, said Thursday that even a quick deal with
Clinton on the bill would not change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The politics has already been defined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House-Senate bargainers reached agreement on a
roughly $289 billion defense bill for 2001, about $20 billion more
than this year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, about $4 billion higher than what Clinton proposed,
contains money for a 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel.
It also has about $100 billion for procurement and for research and
development, Stevens said, amid complaints by Clinton that
lawmakers have added money for items the administration did not
request.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House and Senate leaders, White House budget
chief Jack Lew said the administration ''opposes'' the defense
bill, but did not use the word ''veto.''

<HEADLINE> Marines Relieve Commanding Officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the midst of investigations into
allegations that Marines at the historic Marine Corps Barracks in
Washington have been distributing and using the drug ecstasy, the
commanding officer of the barracks installation was removed this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Marines Corps officials said the investigation is not related to
Col. G. Kevin Brickhouse's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're aware of the investigation, and while it's something
we're not pleased about, it has no relationship to the reassignment
of Col. Brickhouse,'' spokesman Maj. Patrick Gibbons told The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The removal, which was announced Thursday, took place earlier
this week. Officials said the decision was not based on any
misconduct by the colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Marines at the barracks and at the security detachment at the
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis were charged with the use and
distribution of ecstasy in April. One of those under investigation,
Lance Cpl. Anthony E. Barron, told the Post that they have been
mistreated by fellow Marines and commanding officers since the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The accused Marines were treated as if they were ''diseased and
contagious,'' Barron said, and given more cleanup duty and banned
from participating in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps has received inquiries about the investigation
from two members of Congress, Gibbons said, adding that he had no
information about any mistreatment.

<HEADLINE> Episcopalians Back Female Priests  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Episcopal priests and lay people attending the
church's national convention Thursday voted overwhelmingly to
support a crackdown on dioceses that refuse to let women serve as
priests.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the House of Deputies sends the question to the
other chamber in the church legislature, the House of Bishops,
which is expected to vote Friday, the final day of the 10-day
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Bishops also voted Thursday on an issue the 2.4
million-member denomination has been debating for more than two
decades: the rights of homosexuals in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Though a measure that would have developed ceremonial rites for
non-married couples -- heterosexual or homosexual -- was defeated
earlier in the week, the bishops approved a resolution Thursday
calling on the church to minister to unmarried couples in
committed, monogamous relationships that uphold church values.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution doesn't mention homosexuals, but it is widely
seen as a response to a push for the church to bless same-sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Susan Russell, a Los Angeles-based member of Integrity, an
Episcopal advocacy group for gays and lesbians, said the resolution
to support unmarried couples ''acknowledges God's role in
relationships in ways that transcend sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   But one opponent, Gordon Charlton, a retired Texas bishop, said
he fears it might encourage heterosexual couples to live together
out of wedlock ''This in effect makes matrimony an option for
Christian people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate resolution approved Thursday, church leaders were
directed to continue studying whether ceremonial rites should
eventually be developed for same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of women in the priesthood, the House of Deputies
approved the creation of a task force to monitor three Episcopal
dioceses accused of violating a 1976 church law that allows women
to serve as priests. Women now make up nearly 14 percent of
Episcopal clergy.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, delegates from the three dioceses -- Fort Worth,
Texas; San Joaquin, Calif.; and Quincy, Ill. -- moved to the side of
the exhibit hall and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're being asked to deny what we believe. You can't legislate
matters of faith and we'll go to the wall on that,'' said the Rev.
Canon Charles Hough, chairman of the Fort Worth group. He said the
70 million-member Anglican Church, of which the Episcopal Church is
the U.S. branch, shares the three dioceses' traditional view.

<HEADLINE> Source: Suspects Linked to Victim  </HEADLINE>
By VICKI SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANT TOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Authorities believe a gay black man was
beaten to death because he threatened to reveal a sexual
relationship that he allegedly had with the two teen-age suspects,
a source told The Associated Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-olds charged with murder in the death of Arthur
''J.R'' Warren are accused of beating Warren, then running over his
body in a staged hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors have said the suspects, identified by
relatives as David Allen Parker and Jared Wilson, confessed to the
killing, but officials have declined to publicly discuss a motive.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the investigation said the 26-year-old Warren
had a sexual relationship with Parker and there is evidence
indicating he also was involved with Wilson. The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's family denies the allegation. His sister, Trina Sims,
said Warren was a lifelong friend and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ''J.R. was my friend and J.R. was my brother's friend,'' said
Sims, who now lives in South Carolina. ''They had nothing sexual to
do with him. That's a lie. It's wrong and they all know it. ... My
brother is not a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a hate crime or a black crime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both suspects are white.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Richard Bunner could not be reached for comment
Thursday night, and there was also no answer at the offices of the
suspects' lawyers. They have not commented on the case and a gag
order is in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Marion County Sheriff Ron Watkins has asked the FBI to determine
whether the slaying could qualify as either a hate crime or a civil
rights violation under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal hate-crime law, like West Virginia's state
hate-crime law, lacks protection for those targeted because of
sexual orientation. So far, the Warren case does not appear to
qualify as a bias crime, said Jeff Killeen, an FBI agent in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're following this thing very closely,'' Killeen said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Town, a rural town of about 700 people, is just north of
Fairmont in north-central West Virginia.

Cigarette Makers Mull Future
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tobacco attorneys say a punitive damages award in the millions
would snuff out the industry -- never mind the billions sought by sick Florida
smokers in their landmark class-action case. The 300,000 to 700,000 smokers are
asking for up to $196 billion in punitive damages, an amount the nation's five
biggest tobacco companies say would break them. If the jury awarded $75 million,
the average smoker would receive about $150 if it were split among 500,000
people. If the jury awarded the $154 billion, the smokers would each receive
more than $300,000. The key tobacco defense is that the industry has changed its
ways since states began suing in 1994, and that $257 billion in settlements is
enough.

Another 50 were believed buried. Many of those who died in Wednesday night's

   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- After two days of shuttling back and forth between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, President Clinton was stepping back from Mideast
summiteering Thursday, temporarily turning over the reins to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. As Clinton prepared to honor two previous commitments -- an
address to the NAACP in Baltimore and a medal ceremony in Washington -- the
White House adhered to its steadfast refusal to discuss the substance of the

<HEADLINE> Experts Stress That HIV Causes AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- David Ho, one of the world's leading
AIDS researchers, stood in front of thousands of experts at the
International AIDS Conference and made a statement few would have
thought necessary a few months ago: ''HIV is the cause of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   At previous AIDS gatherings that statement would have been so
obvious as to appear bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   But fears that President Thabo Mbeki's recent flirtation with
fringe AIDS theories has given ''AIDS dissidents'' unprecedented
clout, have pushed many AIDS researchers and activists to take a
stand on what had long been considered a closed issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the conference, 5,000 scientists and doctors
signed the ''Durban Declaration,'' published in the journal Nature,
which stated the link between HIV and AIDS is ''clear-cut,
exhaustive and unambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, the declaration's organizers
explained that their extraordinary letter, widely seen as a rebuke
to Mbeki, was necessary because the very fundamentals of anti-AIDS
efforts are based on the premise that HIV causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important for really all our interventions that the
record is set straight that HIV causes AIDS,'' said Stefano Ella,
president of the International AIDS Society.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here would argue that point, though a handful of AIDS
dissidents have held a few forums, many proudly declaring that they
are part of Mbeki's presidential advisory panel on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Mbeki convened that panel, which included many
controversial AIDS theorists, to educate himself on the disease.
After their first meeting, representatives of the panel said the
scientists were designing an experiment to prove whether HIV caused
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   After the panel's second meeting last week, however, they said
they had been misunderstood and were actually searching for more
affordable ways to test for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has insisted that while the panel was meeting the
government was still working to aggressively fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused Mbeki of wasting time, energy and resources
on debating a long-settled issue while the epidemic cut deeper
through the country. Mbeki has insisted the government was
continuing to fight the disease while the panel was meeting, though
critics have charged that the government was not doing nearly
enough to prevent the disease from spreading or to treat those
already infected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actions always speak louder than words,'' said Charles van der
Horst, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina
and one of the main coordinators of the Durban Declaration. ''If
the government proceeds with implementing a comprehensive HIV
prevention program ... that's the important thing. If the
government persists in dealing with AIDS denialists, that's a big
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Thurman, the Clinton administration's top AIDS official,
said in response to a question that U.S. government officials and
scientists agreed that the virus caused the disease. ''I don't
think there's a doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, head of the African National
Congress' Women's League, took a swipe at Mbeki during a rally
Sunday. ''Let me start by asserting what appears to have become
less obvious in South Africa in the last few months. AIDS exists.
HIV causes AIDS,'' she said to raucous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Hoosen Coovadia, the chair of the AIDS conference, said the
Durban Declaration should not be seen as an attack on Mbeki, but as
a simple effort to set the record straight and permanently bury
discredited theories.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that this conference serves as a watershed to put all
of that behind us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ho was far more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure to properly address the modern plague caused by HIV
disease is an act of irresponsibility that will be judged harshly
by history,'' he told the conference Tuesday. ''President Mbeki, I
beg you not to allow your legacy to be defined by inaction on this
human catastrophe.''

<HEADLINE> Investors Upset With Fujimori  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Already facing the wrath of the U.S. Congress
after his contentious re-election, President Alberto Fujimori is
falling out with foreign investors who are upset with what they
view as a shift toward populist economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's ailing business sector was up in arms this week as
Fujimori's government showed signs of reversing a 10-year record of
market-friendly policies amid allegations that he is backing off
promises to strengthen Peru's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is working to push at least a dozen bills crafted from
''urgent'' presidential decrees through Congress in its final
session before he loses a clear majority at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged Thursday that his measures would bring 5 to 6 percent
growth by year's end and said that he is ''betting'' on ''an
economy with social impact'' -- an uncharacteristic statement for
Fujimori, known during his decade in power for fiscal austerity and
towing a strict free-market line.
</P>
<P>
   In past governments, such phrases have been associated with
populist economic policies that focused on spending on the poor
without regard for macroeconomics or balanced budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the move toward populist policies may be
an attempt to shore up his popularity as he becomes more isolated
internationally and internal opposition grows to his authoritarian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   An array of economists, opposition politicians and business
leaders are calling such reforms misguided, particularly as the
politically vulnerable nation is losing foreign investment at a
furious pace.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign direct investment in the first three months of the year
dropped 88 percent compared to the same period in 1999, from $499
million to $62 million, the Central Bank reported.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won an unprecedented third five-year term in a
questioned presidential runoff May 28 that was boycotted by his
opponent, Alejandro Toledo, who charged Fujimori planned to rig the
results.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said it is reserving judgment on
whether to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Congress last month held back $42 million of
emergency anti-narcotics and development aid for Peru. This week,
Sen. Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican, introduced bipartisan
legislation to withhold $10 million more and to require the United
States oppose aid to Peru in most votes of international financial
institutions, like the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney last week advised investors against putting
money into Peru's stock market. On Thursday, it gave a negative
rating to Peruvian bonds, citing Fujimori's autocratic style,
eroding political support and apparent shift to populist policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not understand why the government has decided to push
for measures that are upsetting the business community at a time
when, politically, the government is not sufficiently strong,''
said Ricardo Adrogue, a vice president of economic and marketing
analysis for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial groups are complaining that the rules under which
they do business are ''erratic and increasingly unpredictable,''
the firm reported Thursday. ''They complain that the rule of law is
implemented in a discretionary fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Fujimori's main proposal approved Thursday by Congress,
companies would lose an automatic tax-free status for profits
reinvested into new mining projects.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Morales, vice president of the business group representing
the mining and energy sector, said that ending the incentive could
drive potential investors to countries like Chile or Brazil,
depriving Peru of hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mining of gold, copper, lead and zinc contributes about 12.5
percent of Peru's annual tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori implemented the tax-free incentive in 1992 when the
economy was just beginning to recover from years of runaway
inflation and foreign companies were still a favored target of
leftist rebels.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia mayor and the police department came
under fire Thursday over the videotaped beating of a black man by a group of
officers. The U.S. Justice Department opened an investigation into whether
Thomas Jones' civil rights were violated, and black leaders decried the beating
as police brutality. A dozen officers -- black and white -- surrounded Jones,
30, as he was beaten and kicked on the street in the middle of the day
yesterday, moments after a stolen car chase and a shootout in which he and a
policeman were wounded. The beating was recorded from a TV news helicopter and
broadcast around the country.

   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the arrest of
ousted president Jamil Mahuad on charges of illegally freezing bank accounts
last year. The arrest order for Mahuad, who was toppled from power after a
military-backed Indian uprising on Jan. 21, was issued by Supreme Court
President Galo Pico, who also called for the arrest of former Finance Minister
Ana Lucia Armijos. The Supreme Court is investigating charges that Mahuad and

<HEADLINE> Abortion Debate Rekindles in Canada  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- It had been more than two years since the last
shooting, and while security remained high at abortion clinics and
protesters still prayed outside, the emotions surrounding Canada's
abortion debate seemed to have eased.
</P>
<P>
   Over a five-day period, all that changed.
</P>
<P>
   A series of incidents, capped by the stabbing of a doctor who
performs abortions and threats against others, has again raised
heat around the abortion issue, and left police and those close to
the industry wondering what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   First was the announcement last week that a Vancouver doctor had
started clinical trials on the so-called abortion pill, prescribed
in Europe but previously unavailable in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Then an anti-abortion candidate won election Saturday as leader
of the official opposition party in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Dr. Garson Romalis was stabbed by a hooded attacker,
and the doctor testing the abortion pill received a telephone
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Police also reported a telephone threat against all Vancouver
abortion providers Wednesday by someone claiming to be with a
previously unknown group called the Baby Liberation Army. The
threat was being investigated despite suspicions it was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows of any direct connection between the events, but
they have evoked memories of five sniper attacks in the mid-1990s
that targeted doctors in Canada and the United States. No arrests
have been made in those shootings, although a U.S. fugitive, James
Kopp, has been charged in two and is a suspect in the others.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis -- who survived a 1994 shooting in the first of the
sniper attacks -- was stabbed in the side Tuesday as he entered his
office building in Vancouver. The 62-year-old doctor remained under
police guard Thursday while recovering at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards also checked people at the entrance of the
office of Dr. Ellen Wiebe, who launched the clinical trials of the
RU-486 abortion pill last month.
</P>
<P>
   It took Wiebe 18 months to win government approval to test the
drug, which can terminate a pregnancy up to nine weeks after
conception. She said Wednesday the trials would continue despite
the stabbing of Romalis, who had nothing to do with her project, or
a threat she received on her telephone answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Police confirmed the threat and said they were investigating
whether the drug testing and the stabbing were linked. They advised
abortion providers to maintain a high security alert.
</P>
<P>
   Pro- and anti-abortion groups condemned the stabbing, as did
Stockwell Day, the former preacher chosen as leader of the new
conservative Canadian Alliance party on Saturday. Day, now a major
challenger for the prime minister's office in federal elections
expected within a year, is a known opponent of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked repeatedly at a news conference Wednesday about the attack
on Romalis, Day got exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been very clear on this,'' he said. ''How would you like
me to spell it out? Denounce, condemn, outrageous, untenable. There
is no way I would countenance, or caucus members would countenance,
anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign Life Coalition, an anti-abortion group, said the
renewed focus on the issue would make the public more aware of
issues such as the testing of what it called ''an anti-human
pesticide'' like RU-486. It offered a $6,500 reward for information
leading to the arrest of Romalis' attacker and accused pro-abortion
groups of trying to smear Day and anyone else that opposes
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say the attention given Day's anti-abortion
stand brought the issue to the forefront and may have eased
inhibitions of extremists looking to cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''Day's going to try and deny that he would support any
violence, and maybe he wouldn't follow up his beliefs with
violence, but (our) position is that his platform and his rhetoric
does incite other people who share his beliefs against abortion to
violence,'' said Marilyn Wilson, president of the Canadian Abortion
Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has been legal in Canada since 1988, although less
readily available in some provinces than others. More than 100,000
abortions are performed annually, and polls indicate most Canadians
favor pro-choice policies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such figures, the anti-abortion movement has remained
vocal and security remains high among the estimated 800 doctors in
the country who perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinics say they get threats repeatedly, and protests are
common, like the brown tombstone on a property adjoining the
Everywoman's Health Center in Vancouver -- where Wiebe works -- that
reads: ''In memory of unborn children killed by abortion next
door.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes Elections in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia is arguing against U.N. plans to
hold a supervised election in Kosovo, warning that deteriorating
security conditions for Serbs prevent any vote from being free and
fair.
</P>
<P>
   If the internationally monitored municipal elections go ahead
this year, ethnic Albanian hard-liners will take power and the
chance of creating a truly multiethnic and democratic Kosovo will
be lost, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov told the Security
Council Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The province's estimated 100,000 Serbs are boycotting the
electoral process until the United Nations satisfies their demands
for security against ethnic Albanian attacks and provides for the
return of Serbs who fled when Yugoslav forces withdrew in June 1999
after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that their non-participation ''would distort both the
ethnic and the political picture in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has close cultural and religious ties with the Serbs and
has been Yugoslavia's strongest supporter on the Security Council
along with China, which also questioned whether elections could be
held freely and safely when minorities in Kosovo are still subject
to numerous and well-organized attacks.
</P>
<P>
   With registration for the municipal elections set to end
Saturday, Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Security
Council that nearly 900,000 applications have been received. But
despite intensive efforts by the U.N. mission which is
administering Kosovo, the Serbs and much of Kosovo's Turkish
population refuse to end their boycott, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. deputy ambassador James Cunningham said the United States
believes ''the solution to violence lies in the political process''
and elections and a responsible government structure ''are the best
way to temper passions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's chief U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, signed a
regulation July 8 which gives him the authority to determine the
date for the municipal elections after consulting Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely expected to take place in October.

<HEADLINE> Angola Asked To Negotiate Peace  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is quietly encouraging
Angola to seize an opportunity to restart the country's collapsed
peace process after a string of government military victories and
new demands by the Angolan people for an end to war.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General Ibrahim Gambari, a U.N. special adviser
for Africa, told a news conference Thursday that the government's
military campaign and tightened U.N. sanctions on UNITA rebels were
beginning to weaken UNITA's ability to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   But Gambari stressed that the government's victories alone would
not spell an end to the quarter-century-old conflict since UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi and his supporters were already engaging in
guerrilla warfare and would likely continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to just start thinking of how to bring the peace
process forward because there is a growing recognition in Angola
that this military victory ... by itself will not bring the
fighting to a complete stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Gambari traveled to Angola in May, he said he brought a
message from Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the United Nations
was ready to work with the government to accelerate that peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Gambari also said he hoped to mend the frayed relationship
between the Angolan government and the world body, which
deteriorated after the government accused the United Nations of
turning a blind eye to rebel violations of a 1994 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   That accord collapsed in December 1998 after the government and
UNITA resumed fighting a war that began after independence from
Portugal in 1975. The U.N. peacekeeping force that had been
overseeing the accord pulled out in February 1999, and only a token
U.N. office remains in the capital, Luanda.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, several ''positive'' events indicate that prospects
for an end to the conflict may be emerging, Gambari said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in June suggested
Savimbi could be pardoned if he surrendered and renounced war. The
president also reaffirmed that the collapsed 1994 peace deal was
still valid.
</P>
<P>
   The government previously said it would no longer negotiate with
Savimbi because he reneged on the 1994 deal -- as well as two prior
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Gambari also pointed to a recent rally organized by grassroots
groups and church organizations that drew some 200,000 Angolans
demanding an end to war and a resumption of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, he said, was looking hoping to capitalize on
the changing situation, but only with the agreement of the Angolan
government, which he said was beginning to regain trust in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a report Thursday, Annan outlined the humanitarian costs of
the war, saying the overall situation in the country remains
''precarious.'' One million people are completely reliant on food
aid to survive and another 2.5 million receive other types of
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Access by humanitarian agencies has been restricted because of
the fighting, leaving hundreds of thousands of people at risk,
Annan said.

<HEADLINE> 4 Cops in LA Scandal Plead Innocent  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four anti-gang officers pleaded innocent
Thursday to charges of falsifying arrest reports in a police
corruption scandal that has led to the dismissal of charges or
convictions in nearly 100 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Michael Buchanan, 30, was charged Monday with four
counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice
stemming from two cases in 1996 and 1997. Sgts. Edward Ortiz and
Brian Liddy and Officer Paul Harper are accused of conspiring with
Buchanan to file false reports.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, Liddy and Harper earlier pleaded innocent to separate
charges alleging they framed a gang member arrested on weapons
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal surfaced last summer when a former officer in the
Rampart Station anti-gang unit, Rafael Perez, made accusations
against his former colleagues in exchange for leniency in his own
case involving the removal of cocaine from an evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 20 officers have left active duty in
connection with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have criticized authorities for giving too much
credence to Perez's claims. The former officer was sentenced to
five years in prison in his plea bargain but was given blanket
immunity for abuses he described.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler overturned the
conviction of a 27-year-old woman arrested for dealing rock cocaine
-- the 97th case to be declared tainted by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Velasquez had pleaded guilty in November 1997 to one
count of selling a controlled substance and was sentenced to 180
days in jail and three years probation. Perez later told
authorities he and a former partner had trumped up the charges
against her.
</P>
<P>
   Fidler also warned that if the officers go to trial, the entire
Los Angeles County Superior Court bench may have to be recused from
hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: A former deputy district attorney who is now a Los
Angeles County judge could be called as a witness. Mark Arnold had
been a prosecutor in a case in which Ortiz and Buchanan allegedly
made false statements during an interview preparing for the trial
of two alleged gang members.

<HEADLINE> Security Is New Problem in Compton  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- The city symbolized by gang warfare,
gangsta rap, corrupt politicians and schools so bad they were taken
over by the state is looking for outside help to bring peace to its
streets.
</P>
<P>
   A conflict between Mayor Omar Bradley and the Compton Police
Department culminated this week with the City Council voting to
disband the department and hand over law enforcement duties in the
city of 93,000 to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic move comes on the heels of a marked jump in crime
in Compton, where eight people were killed in 10 days earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents hope the sheriff's department will restore order
to unruly neighborhoods nestled in the urban expanse that surrounds
Los Angeles. Others say the switch will do little.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the overall context of Compton's problems, whatever you do
in law enforcement is not going to solve those problems,'' said
Gary Blasi, a law professor at the University of California, Los
Angeles, and an expert in public policy and poverty law. ''I wish
it were that easy, and I'm sure the sheriff does too.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will increase the number of law enforcement
officers in Compton from 113 to 189 and shrink the annual police
budget by $7.6 million, city spokesman Frank Wheaton said. The city
will use the savings for youth services, street improvements and
attracting private industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems may prove too chronic for a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   Compton, a once all-white suburb that became largely black in
the 1970s and now is majority Hispanic, began a visible decline
with the Watts riots of 1965. Many business owners fled and the
once bustling community of frame houses and minor commerce began to
struggle economically. Crime and poverty became entrenched,
providing bitter inspiration for rap stars and native sons Dr. Dre
and Eazy-E.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the school district was so mismanaged and in debt that
the state took it over. Former Congressman Walter Tucker III was
convicted two years later of taking bribes while mayor of Compton.
A year ago, city officials declared a state of emergency after a
series of arson fires at local schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police are often the ones that get called on to deal with
the failure of other institutions,'' said Blasi, ''and Compton
seems to have a lot of institutions in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of disbanding the police department surfaced in
February, after the Compton Police Officers Association gave
Bradley a no-confidence vote for his removal of the police chief
and a captain.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Ed Aguirre, the association's president and a
nine-year Compton police veteran, said officers initially opposed
the switch to the sheriff's department but have tired of sparring
with City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like anyone who had any pride, we were being taken over and we
were against it,'' Aguirre said. ''But now I guess it's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre and nearly all the other Compton police expect to get
better-paying jobs at the new Compton Sheriff's Station.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents have endorsed the move. They said they are weary
of Compton's reputation and hope crime will finally go down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even during the day people get hijacked. I don't think the
police aren't doing a good job, but a lot of the time they go with
the flow,'' said Marie Sosa, 18, who is studying for her high
school equivalency degree. ''I think it will be better with the
sheriff. They're more strict.''

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Exporters Set for Expansion  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- The whirring of industrial sewing machines
filled the air as hundreds of workers pieced together Bugle Boy
shirts and corduroy trousers at the Thang Long Garment Co.
</P>
<P>
   The goods are destined for the U.S. market, albeit by a
roundabout route. The Hanoi-based firm provides the labor as a
subcontractor for Hong Kong companies that will sell the items on
the American market.
</P>
<P>
   But with the new U.S.-Vietnam trade deal, General Director Le
Van Hong is happily anticipating the prospect of exporting directly
to the United States, bypassing the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have wanted to export to America for a while, but the
tariffs were too high,'' he said. ''With a trade agreement, I
believe we can be very competitive in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Thang Long is one of hundreds of state-owned export companies
that stand to benefit under the landmark bilateral trade agreement
announced in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The pact would require Vietnam to begin opening its markets to
U.S. goods, services and investments, while Vietnamese industries
gain access to the world's largest market at the same low tariffs
given most nations.
</P>
<P>
   Exporters such as Thang Long would see the impact almost
immediately, as tariffs averaging 40 percent drop to below 3
percent under normal trading relations.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank predicts that the deal could boost Hanoi's annual
export revenues by $800 million, or about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's track performance on exports bodes well for fledgling
expansion efforts. Last year, the country recorded exceptional
export growth of 23 percent, from $9.3 billion to $11.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with crude oil exports, the three export sectors crucial
to growth are garments, footwear and seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vietnam is still a poor country and so the domestic market
remains very small,'' said Pham Chi Lan, executive vice president
of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ''A bilateral
agreement with the U.S., one of the world's largest markets, is an
unprecedented opportunity for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Thang Long, which currently exports 90 percent of the shirts,
trousers, jackets, and knitwear it produces to Japan, Eastern
Europe and the European Union, has been quietly laying the
groundwork for expansion into U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Through subcontracting, Vietnamese goods have already been
tested and met the approval of American consumers, said Hong. Last
year, the company invested in new German-made machinery with an eye
on the impending trade deal. Company representatives attended a
trade fair in Atlanta last September and have already snagged the
interest of about six U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's impossible to gauge what the level of demand will
be, managers already have plans in place to immediately increase
production capacity by up to 40 percent if need be, said Hong. The
company currently produces about 6 million pieces a year, with
annual turnover of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Thang Long employs 2,000 workers -- 1,500 in the main
Hanoi factory, with the rest spread out in Hai Phong city and Nam
Dinh province. That number is likely to increase since plans are
already under way to double production in Nam Dinh, and open up
another operation in Ha Tay province.
</P>
<P>
   ''A U.S.-Vietnam trade deal is very good news for us,'' said
Hong. ''We stand ready.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Mulls Inheritance Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming for tens of billions of dollars in
election-year tax breaks, the Senate neared passage of a Republican
bill that would phase out inheritance taxes in defiance of
President Clinton's veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would repeal the 102-year-old federal excise
tax on telephone service, cut taxes paid by some Social Security
beneficiaries and provide tax relief to farmers. It was possible,
however, that these amendments to the inheritance tax measure could
be removed from the bill and wind up as mainly symbolic gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Republican supporters said the ''death tax,'' which reaches a
top rate of 55 percent, hinders investment and job creation, forces
millions of people to do costly estate planning and particularly
hurts farmers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''No family, no farm and no business should have to worry about
this sort of thing,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House in June, would cut the top 55
percent estate tax rate in 2001 and then gradually phase out all
other rates, with full repeal coming in 2010. The cost was
estimated at $105 billion during the phaseout, ballooning to $750
billion in the decade after repeal would be in effect fully.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the government's revenue loss would be
cushioned somewhat because the bill changes the way assets are
valued -- known as basis -- so that an heir would owe higher capital
gains taxes than under current law once the asset is sold. Capital
gains tax rates, however, are much lower than estate tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It removes death as the trigger for any tax,'' said Sen. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the big cost of repeal and the fact that heirs of
only 2 percent of people who die pay estate taxes was evidence that
Republicans wanted mainly to help the rich. In 1997, for example,
only 43,000 estates out of 2.7 million adult deaths were subject to
the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't disguise what you're doing here in terms of a large
tax cut for the wealthiest people in the United States,'' said Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate voted 53-46 to defeat a Democratic substitute
costing $64 billion over 10 years that would have sharply raised
estate tax exemptions -- now $675,000 per individual -- particularly
for the farmers and small businesses that are hurt the most.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Clinton would
certainly veto the bill and that Democrats would be able to sustain
it. ''This isn't going anyplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides used the debate to highlight some of their other tax
cut priorities. In some cases, the votes were intended mainly for
political consumption by senators up for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   In votes Thursday, the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   --Approved, 97-3, an amendment by Roth to repeal on Sept. 1 the 3
percent excise tax on telephone service that dates from the
Spanish-American War. A House-passed version would phase out repeal
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   --Approved, 58-41, an amendment by Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., that
would repeal a 1993 law imposing income taxes on 85 percent,
instead of 50 percent, of Social Security benefits for people with
earnings over $34,000 for a single taxpayer, $44,000 for a married
couple.
</P>
<P>
   --Approved on a voice vote an amendment by Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, giving several tax breaks to farmers, including creation of
tax-deferred accounts in which they could deposit up to 20 percent
of their earnings. The measure also would repeal a law passed last
year forcing small businesses to pay income taxes on certain sales
immediately, even if the buyers were paying in installments.
</P>
<P>
   --Voted 98-1 to make the business research and development tax
credit permanent. It was extended for five years last year.
</P>
<P>
   Abolition of the estate tax is a top priority for Republicans
and several powerful lobbying groups, including the National
Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of
Manufacturers and the American Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   It is supported by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
GOP presidential nominee, and is certain to be an issue in the fall
presidential and congressional campaigns if Clinton follows through
on his veto threat.
</P>

<HEADLINE> OTC Cholesterol Pill Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- It's a dilemma: Too few Americans use
potentially life-saving anti-cholesterol pills, prompting a push to
sell those drugs over the counter. Yet it takes blood tests to know
if the pills are working, and what if people who really need a
doctor's more aggressive treatment self-medicate instead?
</P>
<P>
   Government advisers took the cautious route on the question
Thursday, declaring that Americans shouldn't use the
cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor without a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of a similar drug, Pravachol, will seek to change the
panel's opinion Friday. But experts deemed it unlikely that either
drug, members of a powerful class of cholesterol fighters called
''statins,'' would sit next to the aspirin and antacids any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are interested in playing a role in their own health
care,'' said Edwin Hemwall of Mevacor manufacturer Merck &AMP; Co., who
complained that patients now turn to unproven herbs and dietary
supplements. ''They deserve to have better options.''
</P>
<P>
   But advisers to the Food and Drug Administration chastised
Merck, saying the company didn't prove it can safely sell a
nonprescription dose of Mevacor to the right patients.
</P>
<P>
   The main risk is that nonprescription therapy ''will be viewed
by consumers as alleviating the need for intensive care,'' said
panel chairman Dr. Eric Brass of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a blow to some physician groups, including the
American Medical Women's Association and Association of Black
Cardiologists, that argue nonprescription therapy could help fight
heart disease, the nation's top killer.
</P>
<P>
   Some 53 million Americans have high cholesterol. Only a small
fraction of those with the worst cholesterol levels use
prescription medication. Many don't know they have high
cholesterol; others don't have insurance coverage for prescription
drugs. Plus, many doctors don't follow federal prescribing
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about a third of heart attacks occur in patients whose
cholesterol is higher than optimal but not high enough for
prescription therapy -- levels of 200 to 240.
</P>
<P>
   It is those moderate-risk patients -- 15 million people -- that
Merck and Pravachol maker Bristol-Myers Squibb want to target, by
selling them low doses of Mevacor and Pravachol over-the-counter.
Higher-dose versions of the drugs would remain prescription-only.
(That, however, is a technicality since simply swallowing more
pills increases the dose.)
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA advisers rejected Merck's plan. The problems:
</P>
<P>
   --Patients don't seem to understand cholesterol well enough to
self-medicate. In one study, half the people who thought they were
candidates for over-the-counter Mevacor were wrong. Their
cholesterol was either so high they needed a doctor's care, or too
low to even consider drugs.
</P>
<P>
   --How to ensure nonprescription patients get blood tests to know
if their cholesterol is responding to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   --While high-dose statins have proved life-saving and even
low-dose Mevacor can lower cholesterol, Merck never proved that a
mere 10 milligrams a day would prevent heart attacks in
moderate-risk patients.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even Merck's best analysis estimated that 60 to 70
people would have to use low-dose Mevacor regularly to prevent one
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA isn't bound by its advisers' recommendations but
typically follows them.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision isn't truly fair to Merck, one panelist
acknowledged. A dietary supplement called Cholestin contains the
same cholesterol-lowering ingredient as Mevacor yet, because of a
law Congress passed in 1994, is allowed to sell over-the-counter
without any FDA safety oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a clear paradox,'' said Dr. Richard Neill of the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''two wrongs don't make a right,'' countered Dr. William
Tamborlane of Yale University.

<HEADLINE> Steelworkers OK Arbitration Process  </HEADLINE>
By MARK JEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- United Steelworkers voted overwhelmingly
to use arbitration to end their 21-month labor dispute with Kaiser
Aluminum Corp., the union announced Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The only union local to vote against the proposal was in Newark,
Ohio, where there were 135 votes against and 60 in favor, union
spokesman Jon Youngdahl said. Among the 2,282 members casting
ballots, 74 percent favored arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Union members ''are ready to return to work,'' Youngdahl said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute affected 2,900 members at its start, but some have
since retired or taken other jobs as the dispute dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   The vote means Kaiser and the Steelworkers will try to finish
negotiations on a five-year contract by July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Any remaining issues, including wage increases, will be handled
through binding arbitration by a five-member panel, which will
choose either the company's position or the union's on each issue.
The panel is to hear unresolved issues Aug. 21-25 and rule by
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are expected to return by the end of September, two
years after the labor dispute began. Houston-based Kaiser has said
replacement workers would be laid off, but would be considered for
any vacancies left by Steelworkers who do not return.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now know that whether through continued negotiations by
mid-August or through interest arbitration by the end of September,
our members will proudly march back to their jobs with a fair and
equitable agreement,'' chief union negotiator David Foster said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser spokeswoman Susan Ashe said, ''The company is pleased
with the positive outcome of the ratification vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Steelworkers at five Kaiser plants walked off the job over
wages, benefits, outside contractors and a number of other issues
Sept. 30, 1998. The company hired replacement workers and locked
out union members in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute covers employees in Mead, Trentwood and Tacoma,
Wash.; and plants in Gramercy, La.; and Newark, about 30 miles east
of Columbus, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Let Go of Delegates  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain will keep a schedule fit for a
nominee at the Republican National Convention, seeking the
spotlight even as George W. Bush claims the Arizona senator's
delegates and the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tentative schedule includes one news conference, three
speeches, dozens of media interviews and a bus trip. With an eye on
a second presidential race, the Arizona senator will promote
himself and his reform agenda at the July 31-Aug. 3 convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''When John McCain endorsed Governor Bush ... he said two
things: First, 'I endorse George Bush for president.' Second, 'I
will never stop fighting for my reform agenda.' Those two things
are not mutually exclusive,'' said McCain spokesman Todd Harris.
''He plans to go to Philadelphia to reiterate his support for
Governor Bush while reminding the Republican Party and the nation
of the important reform issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said McCain is welcome to do what
he wants in Philadelphia. ''It's a Republican convention and
Republicans should come and enjoy the festivities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though some mid-level Bush aides are grumbling about McCain's
publicity blitz, senior advisers to both politicians say there is
little friction at the top. Advisers in both camps say they're
working together to make sure McCain's schedule doesn't conflict
with Bush's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers met Thursday to review McCain's plans for his
prime-time speech Aug. 1. So far, neither side has reported
disagreements over the address.
</P>
<P>
   There has been at least one hitch in the discussion: Bush's
campaign had asked to book all of McCain's media appearances, only
to be told that the senator's independent-minded staff had taken
care of that task and didn't need the Bush campaign's help.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who dropped out of the race in March, earned about 240
delegates. Bush supporters were installed in about 70 of those
slots after McCain bowed out, leaving the senator with 170
delegates he considers to be backers.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser said McCain will release his delegates before
the convention, though some may be bound by state law to cast their
first ballot for the senator. His wife, Cindy McCain, is an Arizona
delegate and plans to vote for Bush, according to McCain political
director John Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can support George W. Bush,'' Arizona delegate Philip
Townsend said in a recent interview, ''but my first choice is John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain won't allow his name to be put in for nomination,
resulting in a de facto release of his Arizona delegates. McCain
will address his delegates at a rally on the eve of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The senator and his press corps will arrive in Philadelphia two
days before the convention opens.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Merrill, a pollster at Arizona State University, said
McCain is smart to look for his own headlines out of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It continues to show his brilliance in understanding the media
and how he can use the media to support his self interest,'' he
said. ''But it's a fine line because if the Republican party people
don't feel he is doing everything to support the party, it could
backlash against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the senator's tentative schedule:
</P>
<P>
   --A speech at one of the alternative conventions being organized
by Republican activist Arianna Huffington for fun and attention.
Campaign finance reform will be his main topic.
</P>
<P>
   --Meeting with state delegations, most likely those with the most
influence in future presidential nomination fights.
</P>
<P>
   --Interviews with CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' NBC's ''Today
Show,'' ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' CNN's ''Larry King Show''
and Comedy Central's ''Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   --An autograph session for people buying his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   --A speech to a Jewish-American lobbying organization
</P>
<P>
   --A news conference with MTV regarding the voting practices of
young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   --A private dinner for media heavyweights and a separate party
for 500 people, including political supporters and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's convention address will stick to the night's theme of
''strength and security,'' though aides say he will expand the
subject to include a discussion about America's role in the world
and his belief that Americans should ''serve a cause greater than
one's own self interest.''
</P>
<P>
   That theme leaves room for a mention of McCain's signature issue
of campaign finance reform, aides said, though they had not decided
whether to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes McCain's campaign finance plans, and his aides
would have final say on the draft of the senator's address.

<HEADLINE> Nader's Threat To Gore Highlighted  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The possible threat to Al Gore from a Ralph
Nader candidacy was underscored by a new group of polls taken in
the nation's six largest states that showed Gore's standing against
George W. Bush lower in several surveys that included Nader.
</P>
<P>
   In two states that have been close in head-to-head matchups,
Bush had a 14-point lead in Pennsylvania, where Nader had 8 percent
of the support, and in Illinois, where Nader got the support of 6
percent in the polls by American Research Group of Manchester, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led Bush in New York by 9 points and California by 7
points, where Nader got almost 10 points in each state. Gore has
had a double-digit lead in those states in two-way matchups in
earlier polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were close in Florida, 45 percent for Bush to 43
percent, where Nader seemed to have little impact. Bush led Gore in
April's ARG poll. In Texas, Bush led Gore by 50 points, 71 percent
to 20 percent and again Nader seemed to have little appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The polls did not include Buchanan in the matchups, and it was
unclear whether or not that inflated the support for Nader, a
consumer advocate and Green Party nominee. Pollster Dick Bennett
said he only included Nader because he has been chosen as his
party's nominee, while Buchanan has not.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan pollster Ed Sarpolus saw a similar thing happen with
Nader as a choice in a Michigan poll, but wasn't convinced the
strong Nader showing would stay until November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't see these large numbers holding for Nader,'' said
Sarpolus, who predicted many of these core Democratic voters would
return to Gore by November. ''He is not Ross Perot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the threat from Nader could complicate the Gore strategy if
it causes him to fight for states that once were thought safe, like
California.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Nader can do is make it necessary for Gore to pay a whole
lot more attention to California than he wants to pay,'' said
political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, of Claremont Graduate
University. ''That's the Bush strategy and the introduction of
Nader helps the Bush strategy. Every dollar that is spent, all the
resources spent in California have to come from another
battleground state.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sarpolus said his poll suggested Nader's support comes
directly from Gore, Gallup Poll executive editor Frank Newport said
the evidence is more mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're aware that the Gore campaign seems worried about it,''
said Newport, but said his national polls have shown the presence
of Nader and Buchanan has little effect on the margin between Bush
and Gore. Nader was at 6 percent and Buchanan at 2 percent in a
recent Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   ARG pollster Bennett said another finding of his state polls is
that Gore's unfavorable ratings in several of the states are high,
sometimes in the high 40s or above, usually higher than Bush's
negative ratings in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone polls of 600 likely voters in each state were
taken July 7-12 and have an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A national poll by the Pew Research Center suggested that Bush
is getting stronger support from Republicans than Gore is getting
from Democrats. The poll of 1,673 registered voters taken June
14-21 had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Republicans, 56 percent, said they were strong
supporters of Bush, while less than half of Democrats, 47 percent,
said they strongly supported Gore. Bush's independent backers were
more enthusiastic about him than Gore's were for their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greater intensity of Bush's support may portend better
things for him regarding voter turnout in the fall than for Gore,''
said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. ''It's
awfully important to get your core supporters enthused so they get
out and vote.''

<HEADLINE> Sub Teachers Looking For Respect  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They get no respect. Teachers snub them. They
get paid less. And students welcome the arrival of a substitute
teacher by doubling their usual mischief.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, substitutes are banding together in hopes of
improving their lot: Dozens of the part-time instructors are
gathering in Washington on Friday and Saturday for a first-ever
national meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be taken off the baby sitters' list,'' said Eleanor
Hinton, a retired school guidance counselor who started subbing
because she missed kids. ''We are professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinton once left a middle school class at midday when a fight
among unruly students spilled out into the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I buzzed security three times,'' she said in an interview on
the eve of the conference. ''I'll tell you, I just gave them (the
students) the key to the classroom and I left. They were in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Subs from Florida to Michigan on Thursday recalled horror
stories of student stink bombs, teachers who didn't leave lesson
plans and principals indifferent to classroom riots.
</P>
<P>
   Hinton said the national conference is aimed at changing the way
hundreds of thousands of substitute teachers are treated. They will
decide Friday whether they want to organize as a union, much like
the two major organizations that represent 3.5 million full-time
teachers. Besides more pay, health coverage and respect, the subs
want fair hearings when officials complain about their work and
more access to computer training and other professional
development.
</P>
<P>
   Substitutes routinely fill in for teachers while seeking
full-time teaching jobs or as part-time or retirement work that
allows reduced and flexible hours. In cities like Seattle,
Philadelphia, Fresno, Calif., and Eugene, Ore., they have organized
through the local chapters of the National Education Association
and Service Employees International Union. But there has not been a
single substitute teacher organization until now.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants to look into creating associations that could
bargain with school boards on substitutes' behalf, Hinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately it would improve education for kids,'' said James
Dorward, a researcher at Utah State University's Substitute Teacher
Institute in Logan, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   On any given school day, 9 percent of U.S. classrooms need a
substitute to replace an absent teacher, he said. A well-heeled,
focused organization could have a key role in raising the pay and
training for the ever-growing demand, Dorward said.
</P>
<P>
   Substitutes are a much hotter commodity today. Teacher
shortages, student growth and mandates for smaller class sizes have
left schools scrambling to fill classrooms. And the booming economy
and competition from better-paying jobs is making school
administrators' task even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts are using the pool of subs to recruit
full-timers, even supplementing the cost of degrees and
professional licenses.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, their problems and concerns mirror those of
regular teachers: Pay is low, expectations are high. Shortages are
looming, especially in inner city classrooms and for specialties
such as teaching disabled children or math and science courses. But
without the protection of full-time status, bargaining contracts or
credentials, the going can be tougher for substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are abysmally paid, '' said Kathleen Lyons, spokeswoman
for the NEA teachers union, which pledged this year to increase
efforts to help substitute teachers organize and otherwise improve
their situations. ''They're paid less than folks flipping
hamburgers at McDonald's. The idea is to replace a teacher who's
not there. Education is still supposed to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay varies from district to district, but averages about $65 a
day. Some urban districts like Los Angeles pay more than $150 a
day, but most smaller districts pay just $30 a day.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of a handful states that require substitutes
to have a bachelor's degree and pass a basic skills test. Most
states hire substitutes who have no diploma beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases you are putting people in the classrooms who you
don't know very well,'' said Dorward, also an associate professor
in Utah State's College of Education. ''Consequently not a lot of
learning takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   Subs say that such jobs offer little protection from student
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''If somebody says Ms. McBee grabbed my arm, that's it, I'm out
with no question,'' said Millie McBee, who's been subbing more than
a decade in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hinton said the organization would help professional substitutes
identify and attend special training workshops. And that is
important as more schools are calling their substitutes for days at
a time to fill slots left vacant by full-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just going to teach two days a week and found myself in
the classroom every day,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Summer Nutrition Programs Miss Kids  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Every summer afternoon, courtesy of the
federal government, 100 poor children in Dallas get a sandwich and
a piece of fruit at three Methodist churches.
</P>
<P>
   Any other child that's eligible for the federal school lunch
program is entitled to as many as two free meals daily in the
summer, but most don't get it. Fewer than one in four eligible
children nationwide participate in the summer program and in some
states it's fewer than one in 10.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't enough day camps, activity centers, schools,
churches and other sites authorized to offer the meals, and federal
rules make it too difficult for organizations in some areas to
qualify for the program, nutrition advocates said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3.2 million children participated in the federally
subsidized summer food program last year out of the 14.9 million
who get free or reduced cost lunches at school, according to
Agriculture Department data analyzed by the Food Research and
Action Center, a private advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ''States and communities are falling far short of using
available resources fully, and many needy children are missing the
meals and vital nutrients they need during the summer just as much
as they do the rest of the year,'' said Lynn Parker, a spokeswoman
for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states have participation rates under 10 percent, the
largest of which is Texas, where 142,374 youngsters got free meals
last summer out of the 1.6 million children in the school-lunch
program. Alaska has the lowest rate, with 2.9 percent of its
eligible kids participating.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia had the highest participation rate, at
67.6 percent, followed by Nevada at 44.1 percent and California at
43.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some kids are on their own to fend for themselves. Usually
it's not a nutritionally balanced meal,'' said Shawn Jucht, who
runs the Dallas program.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the low participation in the summer program is
that federal rules require that 50 percent of the children fed by
an organization must be eligible for subsidized school lunches,
says the Food Research and Action Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unless 50 percent are eligible, the group providing the meals
gets no USDA reimbursement for any of the children fed. That
threshold was raised from 30 percent as a cost-cutting move in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Reimbursements for the summer meals are $1.25 for each breakfast
served, $2.18 per lunch or supper and 50 cents per snack.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states -- California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York,
Texas, Vermont and Washington -- chip in some of their own money to
make up for a cut Congress made in the reimbursements in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With the low participation rates, many children are winding up
in soup lines, said Doug O'Brien, public policy director for
America's Second Harvest, a hunger relief program that distributes
food to 200 food banks nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those food banks reported in a 1998 survey that they
have ''many more'' children coming in for food during the summer
than at other times of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you expand the summer food program, you'll drive down
demand at feeding programs. We don't believe that kids should be
getting food at soup kitchens and church pantries when there's a
summer nutrition program,'' said O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials have been visiting states with the lowest
participation in the program to recruit new organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1997, Texas required all school districts to offer
summer meals if at least 60 percent of the children in the district
were eligible for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to make it available in every possible
community,'' said Chris Traylor, a spokesman for the Texas Human
Services Department. Rural areas ''are the most difficult to
target.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, meanwhile, is requiring that programs be available in
areas where 50 percent of the youngsters are eligible.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NJ Police Boss Speaks About Photo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman's attorney
general and chief of staff -- both of them now justices on the state
Supreme Court -- were present in 1996 when she was photographed
frisking a black man during a police ride-along, the former state
police superintendent says.
</P>
<P>
   Former Superintendent Carl Williams, who was fired by Whitman in
1999 for linking drug trafficking to minorities, told reporters
Thursday that Whitman was joined in the police van by Deborah T.
Poritz, then attorney general, and Peter G. Verniero, then
Whitman's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Poritz is now chief justice of the Supreme Court; Verniero is
also a justice. Both were appointed by Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman on Thursday denied they were along, as did Supreme Court
spokeswoman Winnie Comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Williams is wrong,'' Comfort said.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, taken by an officer during a visit by the
governor to Camden, was subpoenaed in May by several black and
Hispanic troopers who claim their superiors subjected them to
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, whose administration have been dogged by accusations of
insensitivity to minorities, has rejected any attempt to associate
the patdown search and the 4-year-old photograph with the practice
of racial profiling, in which police target suspects based on race.
</P>
<P>
   During the governor's visit to Camden, state troopers offered
Whitman the chance to search a suspect. Whitman said she accepted
because she felt it was her duty to experience all areas of police
work.
</P>
<P>
   The man she frisked is Sherron Rolax, who was 17 at the time,
the Star-Ledger of Newark reported Friday. Rolax refused to
comment, but an uncle, Anthony English, said his nephew told him
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Rolax, who was not arrested that night, is now in the
Mountainview Youth Correctional Facility on 1998 drug charges, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Thursday that he opposed Whitman's visit but was
powerless to keep her off the streets: ''She's the governor. She's
the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor fired Williams after he was quoted as saying that
minorities are more likely to be involved in cocaine and marijuana
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a judge dismissed Williams' lawsuit that claimed
Whitman, Verniero and other officials improperly asked for his
resignation.

<HEADLINE> Bush Aims To Swing All Voter Types  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's trip to the NAACP convention
in Baltimore this week was more a signal to swing voters that he's
open to all types of Americans than it was a direct bid for black
voter support.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a cornerstone of the effort to show he's not a
fire-breathing right-winger,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political
scientist at the University of Texas and a veteran Bush-watcher.
''His-long term mission is to reposition the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's NAACP trip on Monday, the upcoming Republican convention
filled with images of diversity, and campaign stops in between
focused on the needs of the poor are all part of that effort to
appeal to swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in presidential elections routinely get the support
of about 10 percent of black voters or slightly more. If Bush
pushes that number a bit higher among blacks, the most loyal voter
base for Democrat Al Gore, it still won't be nearly as important to
his campaign as the message he sent this week to the broad middle
of the American electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a message to moderate, white, middle-of-the-road
Americans who might be afraid that electing a Republican
conservative from the South would turn the clock back on civil
rights,'' said political scientist Lance DeHaven Smith of Florida
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told those present at the NAACP meeting in Baltimore that
he wanted to say ''here's where we have fallen short and here's
where we will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his own stop Wednesday and quickly reminded the NAACP
of his longstanding commitment.
</P>
<P>
   He was introduced by an NAACP board member as someone who,
''unlike a lot of people, has not just discovered the NAACP, has
not just discovered the problems of poor people, African-American
people and people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign staff said his efforts to reach out for Hispanic
and black votes are real, but acknowledged the symbolism of the
trip as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is sincere in his efforts to attract minority
voters and these events also symbolize the governor's desire to be
a unifying force on the national scene,'' said spokesman Ray
Sullivan. ''He's serious about ending partisan strife in Washington
and bringing people together, people from all parts of the country,
all political parties and all ethnic backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush trip was dismissed as ''transparent political
posturing'' by Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman. ''He said nothing
of substance and has done nothing of substance to appeal to
African-American voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip provided an important image for the campaign that
counters the image of Bush at a conservative Christian college in
South Carolina during that state's primary campaign, said Kathleen
Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family has a tradition of pushing the Republican Party
toward expanding its appeal to minorities. Former President Bush
addressed the NAACP in 1988, and encouraged the GOP earlier to
increase its efforts to win over minorities. Jeb Bush, younger
brother of the likely nominee, reached out to blacks in 1998 on the
way to winning the governorship of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The father got 11 percent of the black vote in 1988 and Jeb Bush
got 14 percent in Florida two years ago. George W. Bush's support
among blacks in current national polls is in the mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Plascencia, associate director of the Tomas Rivera Policy
Institute at the University of Texas, which focuses on issues of
interest to Hispanics and other minorities, said it's difficult to
judge what Bush would do as president based on his limited role as
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing much has changed,'' Plascencia said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the principal campaign tasks for the likely nominee is
reassuring moderates and independents who may be suspicious of his
''compassionate conservative'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of independents are worried about private deals (with
very conservative leaders), especially people focused on the
abortion issue,'' Buchanan said. ''They point back to the South
Carolina primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he believes George W. Bush's efforts at outreach
are ''spontaneous and genuine,'' but questioned the level of
follow-through in government policies after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He provides great grace notes,'' Buchanan said, ''but the
policies aren't there.''

<HEADLINE> Piazza Back To Normal After Beaning  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mike Piazza went back to work Thursday night
against another intimidating pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game since being hit in the head by Roger Clemens'
fastball Saturday, the New York Mets catcher faced hard-throwing
Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's first pitch to Piazza was high and in, but Piazza
didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, it's good just to get back out there,'' said
Piazza, who singled in the eighth inning and threw out a runner in
the Mets' 4-3 loss to the Red Sox. ''I feel lucky there wasn't more
severe effects. It's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and Martinez last squared off in June 1998, and exchanged
words through the papers after Martinez plunked Piazza in the hand.
Piazza said that confrontation wasn't on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was two years ago,'' he said. ''I'm not going to go up
there and feel like I have anything to look out for.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up grounding to third in his first at-bat, flew out
twice to right, and singled in the eighth. The eighth-inning hit
was misplayed by Carl Everett, allowing Edgardo Alfonso to score
from first to give the Mets a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's beaning has provided ample fodder for the New York
media in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   First, Piazza called a news conference and accused Clemens of
throwing at his head, a charge the New York Yankees pitcher has
denied.
</P>
<P>
   The saga continued when Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
charged that the Mets were using the incident to distract attention
from the fact that they dropped the first three games of the series
with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know if it's worth a response,'' Piazza said of
Steinbrenner's comments. ''It's a very unusual opinion. Personally
I don't care what people think. I said what I had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine said only those who have been hit
in the head by a pitch should be talking.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't have anything to say because you don't know
anything about that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Athletics 2  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds, back after missing the
All-Star game because of a slightly fractured right thumb, put San
Francisco ahead with his 29th home run as the Giants beat the
Oakland Athletics 4-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, who missed six of eight games before the All-Star break,
homered in the fourth off Mark Mulder (5-5), leaving him tied with
Toronto's Carlos Delgado, one behind Mark McGwire of St. Louis and
Ken Griffey Jr. of Cincinnati, who share the major league lead. It
was Bonds' first homer since June 29 at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Ortiz (5-8), just demoted from the rotation, relieved
starter Joe Nathan after a scoreless but shaky first inning and
allowed one run on four hits in six innings. Robb Nen pitched the
ninth for his 18th save in 23 chances, allowing Eric Chavez's 14th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder gave up two runs and four hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Marvin Benard extended the lead to 4-1 in the
seventh with a two-run single off Doug Jones. San Francisco had
loaded the bases when Ellis Burks tripled, Bill Mueller walked and
J.T. Snow reached on shortstop Miguel Tejada's error.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's RBI single put San Francisco ahead in the second but
Jason Giambi's sacrifice fly tied the score in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan loaded the bases in the first inning on Long's single and
one-out walks to Giambi and Ben Grieve. Tejada and Stairs then
popped out.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, who was on the disabled list earlier this season with
tendinitis in his right shoulder, felt tightness in the shoulder
during warming up and during his short appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was 4-8 with a 6.92 ERA before he was sent to the bullpen,
winning once -- at Houston on June 25 -- in his last nine starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ortiz's previous relief appearance at Chicago on Sept. 28,
1998. ... The Athletics placed John Jaha on the 15-day disabled
list with tendinitis in his left shoulder. It's possible Jaha will
have surgery, which will keep him out for six weeks. The A's
recalled Adam Piatt from Triple-A Sacramento to fill the roster
spot. Piatt, who joins the A's for the third time this season, has
hit .283 with eight home runs in 65 games with Sacramento. ... The
Giants will continue their charity Until There's a Cure Day at
their new digs, Pacific Bell Park. The event, which raises money
for AIDS research and treatment, will be held July 16 when the
Giants play the Rangers. The Giants were one of the first teams to
raise money for the cause.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Holds Tour de France Lead  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONT VENTOUX, France (AP) -- With the 12th and toughest leg of
the Tour de France successfully completed, Lance Armstrong has the
title in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has a 4-minute, 55-second lead after finishing second
to Marco Pantani in Thursday's 93-mile stage to Mont Ventoux.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Texan has already proved himself as the most
powerful rider in the mountains -- where the tour is won and lost --
with two second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first part of the race has gone really well. But there is
still a long way to go,'' Armstrong said. ''There is no way the
tour is already won.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armstrong is a great competitor,'' he said. ''He is in such a
good position it is difficult to see him being stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountain stages aren't over. On Saturday, there is a
155-mile trek into the Alps, with climbs to follow on Sunday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Armstrong powered away from his main rivals on
Thursday makes him appear capable of stretching his lead over Jan
Ullrich, his only serious rival in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was the only racer who could keep up with 1998 tour
winner Pantani after the Italian rider made up a gap of more than
30 seconds late in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the job was done, Armstrong held back at the end to
preserve energy for the rest of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had no intention of stealing the glory from the
popular Italian, having ensured a bigger lead over Ullrich, who was
exhausted on the slope.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by suspicions over drug taking, Pantani, the only
rider to have won the Tour de France and the Italian Giro in the
same year, nearly quit the sport two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani didn't want to defend his tour title last year after
being thrown out of the 1999 Giro because of a positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
   But the rider whose bandana and earrings have earned him the
nickname ''The Pirate'' remains highly respected in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the mind of a lot of people, Pantani is the best climber in
the world, and for him a win is important. I will forget stage wins
for now,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   'A new tour has begun for me with the possibility of a good
placing in Paris,'' the Italian said.
</P>
<P>
   Team managers have said all along that the rider who emerged as
leader at Ventoux, 62 miles north of Marseille, would still be
wearing the yellow jersey as leader on the final dash along the
Champs-Elysees on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   That's Armstrong. And Thursday's racing did nothing to dispel
the predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good day for us,'' Armstrong said. ''There were two
stories. I want to thank the team. The second was the wind. It was
so windy today that I am glad it is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 300,000 fans cheering on the cyclists in the
final 13-mile climb, Armstrong always looked in control, with his
U.S. Postal Service teammates more aggressive than during a
disappointing performance in a climb in the Pyrenees on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th stage was regarded as the toughest of the 2000 tour,
and the climb up Mont Ventoux was unforgiving. Just 14 miles from
the finish line, riders are only about 900 feet above sea level. By
the end, they are more than 6,000 feet above it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the hardest climb of this year's tour,'' Armstrong said
before the race. ''It is very special, very mystical. It is so hard
that if you are good, you can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mont Ventoux's special place in tour history added spice to
Armstrong's bid for consecutive wins.
</P>
<P>
   The peak has witnessed some of the 97-year-old race's greatest
climbing -- and one of its greatest tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, British cyclist Tom Simpson, cheered on by fans under a
burning sun, collapsed and died near the peak. Tests showed his
blood contained amphetamines, a stark reminder that drug problems
are nothing new to cycling.
</P>
<P>
   As well as being the toughest leg, the course to Mont Ventoux
was perhaps the most gorgeous of the three-week tour, with cyclists
passing miles of lavender fields and lemon trees before the final
steep climb.
</P>
<P>
   The race continued Friday with the 13th stage, a 115-mile course
from Avignon to Draguignan.

<HEADLINE> Three Tied for Senior Players Lead  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Bruce Fleisher has started fast in majors
before, only to be disappointed. Will it happen again?
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, John Jacobs and South African Hugh Baiocchi all
matched the first-round record with 7-under-par 65s to share the
lead heading into Friday's second round of the Senior Players
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble for Fleisher, who has never won a major, generally comes
in the later rounds. Especially if he's playing a big-name star
like Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Fleisher was the leader after three rounds
of the U.S. Senior Open, only to have Irwin make up two strokes on
the first hole and breeze past him for the victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bruce didn't use his head on that first hole in the Open,''
Jacobs said after Thursday's round. ''Hale is one of those guys, if
you give him a little crack, he'll break the door down.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, lurking three strokes off the pace at 68, was satisfied
with his position.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't identify that well with Thursdays and Fridays,'' said
Irwin, seeking his fourth win and second major of the season. ''But
I do like weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, who has won 10 times since joining the senior circuit
in 1999, beats Irwin once in a while, of course. But so far, never
in the big ones -- and this is the fourth and final major for the
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to sit here and deny that I can beat him from
time to time,'' said Fleisher, who had just one victory during his
years on the regular PGA tour. ''I can and will. But if you really
look at the overall picture of how I feel, I've got total respect
for Hale Irwin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin isn't the only big name in this field.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders had a 1-stroke edge over Tom Kite, Bob Murphy and
Jesse Patino under almost perfect conditions at the TPC of
Michigan, a 6,966-yard layout designed by Jack Nicklaus across the
road from the world headquarters of sponsoring Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Thompson, Allen Doyle and Jerry McGee were another
stroke back at 67.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't feeling that well,'' Fleisher said. ''But I made that
no-brainer (30-foot putt) for birdie at No. 8 and that kind of got
me going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fleisher's best shot of the day was a 4-iron he holed from
197 yards for an eagle on the par-4 14th.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball rolled up the plateau to the second level of the
green, where the pin was located, fans began shouting, ''Go, go.''
When the ball disappeared into the cup, Fleisher dropped the club
and thrust both arms over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had some doubts when it was in the air,'' said Fleisher, a
three-time winner this season who went into the championship
trailing Irwin by just $10,474 on the money list. ''But, gosh, that
was pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   A few paces from the hole, Fleisher went into an exaggerated
slow step to the cup. After lifting the ball up past the pin,
Fleisher gave it a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Was this a practiced routine?
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you kidding me?'' Fleisher said, laughing. ''That
surprised me, just like everybody else. Still, it was the best shot
I hit all day. The best-feeling shot.''
</P>
<P>
   While Irwin and Larry Nelson -- the rest of Fleisher's threesome
-- labored over their putts, Fleisher sat on the hill overlooking
the green and tied his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the final major on the senior circuit, it's
Fleisher's last chance this season to fill a noticeable void on his
resume.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't measure my success by majors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, seeking his second win of the season, got off to the
quickest start, with birdies on the first two holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This course is in very good shape, and the greens were
holding,'' said Jacobs, who is 13th on the money list. ''When you
have those two combinations, they are going to shoot low. I don't
care where they stick the pins, they are going to shoot low.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the course is in magnificent shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Baiocchi, who hasn't won since 1998, shot 33-32 for his low
round of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't had a very good year at all,'' said Baiocchi, 35th
on the money list. ''The difference today is that I putted really
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Five other golfers -- Chi Rodriguez, Nicklaus, Ben Smith, J.C.
Snead and Tom Weiskopf -- have shot 65s on the opening day of this
event. But only Nicklaus, in 1990, went on to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of this event will earn $315,000 of the $2.1-million
purse.

<HEADLINE> Williamson, Perry Share GMO Lead  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jay Williamson thought small, and it helped him
take a share of the early lead at the Greater Milwaukee Open.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson and Kenny Perry shot 7-under-par 64s in the first
round of the GMO on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first players off the course on a gorgeous day at
Brown Deer Park, Williamson played a steady, bogey-free round that
included several big shots with his 30-inch putter. He cut his
putter down last week to what he claims is the smallest club on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a fan of small clubs in general,'' Williamson said. ''It
allows me to bring it straight back and straight through.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, who bounced back and forth through qualifying school
and the lower tours for much of the 1990s, would love to beat a
weakened field at the GMO. Just five players ranked in the top 50
are here, with most choosing to take an extra week of practice for
next week's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to play a golf tournament knowing that I have a job
for the next year,'' Williamson said. ''I'm really close to being
where I want to be in this world of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his lifestyle has changed drastically since the birth of
his 14-month-old daughter Whitney. Practice time is more scarce,
and early-morning tee times like the one he had on Thursday don't
scare him as much.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's made me a much better person,'' Williamson said. ''I'm
still trying to figure out if it's made me a better golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders are just one stroke ahead of a group of five players
that includes Madison native Jerry Kelly. With an enthusiastic
gallery cheering his every move, Kelly birdied three of four holes
late in his round and held a share of the lead before bogeying his
final hole to finish with a 65.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has yet to win on the tour, but he has consistently
performed well in front of the home fans. His best career finish
was a second place in the 1996 GMO, and last year he held a lead on
the tournament's final day before falling to Carlos Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of feel like I'm destined to win somewhere, and this
has been my best tournament,'' Kelly said. ''You put two and two
together, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   After his round, Kelly headed to his home 80 miles away in
Madison. He planned to spend the evening working on his game and
spending time with his 23-month-old son, Connor, who joined his
father in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get some adrenaline out there when you know you're playing
well,'' Kelly said. ''But it's not quite the same as when you get
the lead on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Pavin, Frank Lickliter, Loren Roberts and Cameron Beckman
matched Kelly's 65, while Franco was one of six players two strokes
off the lead at 66.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who beat Tom Lehman by two strokes last year, is trying
to become the 10th player in tour history to successfully defend
two tournament titles in the same year. Two months ago, he defended
his title in the Compaq Classic in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who hasn't won on tour since 1995, played in the
afternoon, but still matched Williamson's morning score. He
credited the immaculate condition of Brown Deer Park's greens with
his ability to close strong in a bogey-free round.
</P>
<P>
   The course was hit with 13 inches of rain in June and more this
month. The greens are mostly dry now, but still moist enough to be
soft. More than one player called them perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I play like I did today, I've got a good shot at this golf
tournament,'' Perry said. ''I think as the greens speed up by the
weekend, it's going to be a very challenging course.''

<HEADLINE> Late Arrival Shares Early LPGA Lead  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- The solution to Rosie Jones' putting
problems found her.
</P>
<P>
   A player with 10 career victories on the LPGA Tour, including
one in each of the last five years, isn't supposed to have just two
top 10 finishes by the time July rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been struggling with my putter for the last month,''
Jones said. ''I've been playing well and I felt like I could have
contended, but I just didn't have a good putter.''
</P>
<P>
   There didn't seem to be much of a problem Thursday as Jones shot
a 4-under-par 67 in the opening round of the Big Apple Classic and
shared the lead with Allison Finney and Kim Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam, coming off her fourth victory of the year,
Michele Redman and Jennifer Feldott were tied for fourth with 69s.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made seven birdie putts, including three in the last four
holes at Wykagyl Country Club. None of the birdie putts was longer
than 16 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suddenly, yesterday, I stumbled into something, something that
felt good,'' Jones said. ''I had just lined it up wrong. To just
line it up right isn't always easy. Something has to click in your
setup to make it work and be comfortable, and I did that yesterday.
It just kind of found me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has had success in this tournament sponsored by Japan
Airlines, finishing third in 1990 and second in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time I play a golf course in New York, they really set up
well for me because you have to hit it down the middle,'' Jones
said. ''You really have to hit it straight here and play good,
solid golf, and you usually have to bring your putter with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Finney, whose only tournament victory came in 1989, also closed
with a flourish, going 4 under for the last four holes.
</P>
<P>
   She eagled the par-5 15th with a 12-foot putt and made birdies
on the par-3 16th and par-5 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was kind of coasting and got hot the last few holes,'' said
Finney, who had missed four straight cuts before finishing tied for
51st last week at the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic. ''Making the cut
last week was a big boost for me. I'm not exempt this year and it's
just been hard for me to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Finney likes being in the New York area for reasons other than
the golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, I got to go down and see a rehearsal for 'One Life
to Live,' the soap opera,'' she said. ''That was a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the last player into the field as the first
alternate, and she didn't find out she would be playing until two
hours before she teed off. She replaced Wendy Doolan, who had to
withdraw because of a hand injury.
</P>
<P>
   Williams came up with her low round of the year and her first
below 70.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hadn't hit a ball for 10 days because I have a bad back,''
Williams said. ''They called me, so I had to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' best finish in her 11 years on tour was a tie for
second in 1988. She had back surgery in September 1998, and that
limited her to eight tournaments last year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was struck in the neck by a stray bullet in 1994 as she
walked into a drug store in Youngstown, Ohio, hours after
completing a tournament round. The bullet lodged in her right
shoulder and was removed the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a round as good as Thursday's, Williams had to answer
questions about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather be known as 'The girl that won the tournament, did
you know she got shot?' rather than 'Oh, that's the girl that got
shot,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, who won this event in 1998 and is second on the money
list, was 2 over after the front nine and her four birdies on the
back included the two late par-5s.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster, third on the LPGA money list, had a 70, including
an eagle at No. 15, while Karrie Webb, No. 1 on the money list, had
a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Sherri Steinhauer opened with a 74.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Secure More Power  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Pressured by fears of more unrest, Fiji's
tribal chiefs picked a rebel supporter as vice president Friday,
opening the way for backers of coup leader George Speight to fill
Fiji's new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage crisis that began May 19, when rebels seized
Parliament, ended Thursday when Speight released his 18 captives in
exchange for the right to reshape Fiji's government. In charge
would be ethnic Fijians -- not the Pacific nation's ethnic Indian
minority.
</P>
<P>
   At Speight's behest, the Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's
traditional power, named Ratu Josefa Iloilo as president Thursday.
For the vice president post, they deferred to Speight's wishes
again and appointed Ratu Jope Seniloli on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Iloilo is expected to name the new government within days,
presumably filling it with Speight supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have just resolved the crisis we have been in,''
said Sitiveni Rabuka, chairman of the chiefs' council.
</P>
<P>
   But the chiefs didn't seem entirely happy with doing Speight's
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wins a coup,'' said Rabuka, a former military officer
who led two coups in 1987 and was later elected prime minister. The
recent crisis had left Fiji badly damaged, and Speight's victory
was hollow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole nation suffers. He is free to enjoy his
self-perceived victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A caretaker administration appointed by Fiji's military leaders
will stay in place until the new government is picked. The military
has been in control of Fiji since shortly after the May coup.
</P>
<P>
   Even after releasing the last of their hostages, the rebels kept
up the pressure on the chiefs by issuing thinly veiled threats of
more civil strife unless they are installed in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get into power, we will call off the dogs,'' rebel
spokesman Jo Nata told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio earlier
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the hostage crisis, Fiji is a vastly changed
country. The elected government is gone, ethnic tensions remain
inflamed, and the crucial tourist industry is ravaged. The United
States, Australia and New Zealand and have urged their citizens to
leave. International sanctions are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's rebels are indigenous Fijians who said the nation's
large ethnic Indian minority had too much power. They demanded that
the country's multiracial constitution be scrapped and that
Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, be
deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal reached Sunday, Speight released the last of his
hostages -- including Chaudhry, now stripped of power -- just as the
chiefs began their two-day meeting Thursday to pick the
government's top spots.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Speight said his campaign will not be complete until
his men are in power -- despite renewed warnings that Fiji will
become an international pariah if rebels are included in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   And he warned that any attempt to restore multiracial democracy
in Fiji would result in another civil uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any attempt by anybody to return Fiji to the status quo before
May 19 will be met with the same resistance we showed to the army
of this country,'' Speight told Australia's Nine Network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's deal fulfills many of Speight's demands, including a
new government, a new constitution curtailing Indian rights and
immunity for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the chiefs' council urged rebel supporters to stop a
campaign of civil unrest that has been sweeping the Pacific
archipelago nation over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Speight supporters occupied several police stations, a military
base, a hydroelectric dam and a tuna cannery. They also surrounded
the capital, Suva, with roadblocks and threatened to close down the
international airport.
</P>
<P>
   However, four tourist resorts were seized by groups apparently
taking advantage of an amnesty for political crimes to pursue land
disputes. No hostages were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the European Union
say sanctions are inevitable unless Fiji returns to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian government said Friday it would ''absolutely
not'' accept Speight or anyone involved in taking hostages as
members of Fiji's new government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Chaudhry was illegally removed in a criminal act and I
think the behavior of the great Council of Chiefs in bowing to
Speight's demands has been to betray the democratic institutions of
Fiji,'' Australian Prime Minister John Howard said.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturers Pressure USA Swimming  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the U.S. Olympic swimming trials less than a month away,
there seems to be more attention on what everyone will be wearing
than the competition itself.
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming has banned the revolutionary, full-length bodysuits
from the Aug. 9-16 trials in Indianapolis. But two major
manufacturers are pressuring to get that decision overturned,
insisting they can meet the demand of outfitting some 1,300
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schubert, coach of the U.S. men's team that will swim in
Sydney, is getting tired of the whole controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just tell us what we can wear and let us focus on swimming,''
he said Thursday during a meet in California. ''It's been so
distracting and disruptive. I would hope would we would stick with
the decision the board of directors made. All the kids are
comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adidas is offering suits -- free of charge -- to any competitor
who wants to wear the high-tech attire. Another company, Tyr Sport,
filed a grievance Thursday with the U.S. Olympic Committee, asking
it to overturn the decision made last month by swimming's governing
body.
</P>
<P>
   But a change of course would cause major problems for another
manufacturer, Nike, which has switched its production lines to turn
out suits meeting the standards imposed by USA Swimming.
</P>
<P>
   The board of USA Swimming voted overwhelmingly June 22 to
prohibit full-length bodysuits from being worn in the Olympic
trials, even though the world's governing body, FINA, has approved
the suits for the Sydney Games in September.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Tyr's grievance, USA Swimming said it plans to
review last month's decision, which affects only the trials.
American swimmers have been wearing the suits at other meets and
will be allowed to do the same in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our intention, as it has been from the beginning, to do
what's best for both the athletes training for the trials and those
that will ultimately make up our 2000 U.S. Olympic swim team,''
said Chuck Wielgus, the organization's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Bodysuits, which are believed to improve performance as much as
3 percent, are seen as one of the major reasons for the outbreak of
world-record performances in recent months. But, with some
manufacturers struggling to keep up with demand, USA Swimming was
concerned there wouldn't be enough bodysuits for everyone at the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Wielgus expressed regret that ''our athletes are the ones who
are getting caught in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the mayhem over this issue, the media focus has turned away
from the great stories about our athletes to stories about
swimsuits,'' he said in a statement. ''Less than four weeks out
from the trials, our athletes should be focused on their
preparation and not concerned with this issue. It is our intention
to resolve this matter as quickly and fairly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming asked the four leading suit manufacturers -- Speedo,
adidas, Nike and Tyr -- to make their revolutionary suits available
to all swimmers by June 14, giving them plenty of time to get
comfortable in the new attire before the trials.
</P>
<P>
   But adidas was the only one that met the deadline, which led USA
Swimming to ban the newest bodysuits from the trials. Last week, it
clarified that ruling by saying it affected those suits that
covered the arms and stretched below the knees.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas, aligned with Australian sensation Ian Thorpe and signed
up American world record-holder Ed Moses, said it could provide a
full-length suit to any swimmer that wanted one at the trials.
Discussions between the two sides are underway.
</P>
<P>
   ''What made us make this decision was the performance of the
athletes,'' said Chris Duplanty, swim sales manager for adidas.
''It's just another step, from our standpoint, of standing behind
the athletes as they prepare for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that it wasn't a marketing ploy to lure more
swimmers to adidas' products and gain more exposure at the
high-profile trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''If availability was the bottom line and there are full
bodysuits out there that are available, maybe just with a different
brand on them, then that's the confusing part for us,'' Duplanty
said. ''We hear what USA Swimming is saying and we're acknowledging
their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike is hoping the original decision will stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've switched our production to the knee-length suits,'' said
Kathryn Reith, a company spokeswoman. ''Should USA Swimming decide
at the last minute that full-length suits will be allowed, we may
not be able to produce one for every single swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyr Sport said it can provide enough suits for its swimmers at
the trials. If the company fails to reach an agreement with the
USOC within two days, the grievance goes to the American
Arbitration Association for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision is illogical and unreasonable,'' Tyr spokesman
Chris Wilmoth said. ''If it's permissible to wear (bodysuits) to
qualify for the trials and at the Olympics, then it should be fine
to wear them at the actual trials.''

   Handed a three-run lead by Brian Anderson, Byung-Hyun Kim (2-4)
walked Rusty Greer leading off and hit Rafael Palmeiro with on an
0-2 pitch with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto hit an RBI single and Segui, batting for Gabe
Kapler, followed with a triple that dropped below the glove of
diving Steve Finley in center.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb was intentionally walked, and pinch-hitter Dave
Martinez walked with two outs. Alicea then singled to right.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman (2-4) won despite allowing an RBI infield single
to Bell in the eighth, and John Wetteland pitched a scoreless ninth
for his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Scott Sheldon started the Rangers' comeback with an
eighth-inning homer off Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Bell hadn't homered or driven in a run in nine games since June
30 before his solo shot in the third off Rick Helling. After Tony
Womack's fifth-inning single, Bell hit an opposite-field homer,
giving him 11 this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bell's first multihomer game of this year, the seventh of
his career. He had been homerless in 43 at-bats since connecting
off Cincinnati's Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona third baseman Matt Williams and first baseman Erubiel
Durazo were activated from the disabled list before the game and
each went 1-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, beaten by the Reds on July 3 for his first home loss
in 20 starts since Sept. 19, 1998, allowed four hits in eight
innings, struck out six and walked none, allowing an eighth-inning
homer to pinch-hitter Scott Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   Helling left after a leadoff walk to Bell in the seventh. He
gave up seven hits and four walks and struck out three. He escaped
a bases-loaded jam in the fourth when Travis Lee struck out on
three pitches and Anderson hit into a forceout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Diamondbacks put INF Danny Klassen on the DL and
optioned OF Rob Ryan to Triple-A Tucson. ... Although Ivan
Rodriguez's hitting streak ended at 11 games, Greer's single in the
first inning extended his streak to 11 -- his longest since last
August. ... Texas LHP Darren Oliver, on the DL since June 17 with
weakness in his left shoulder, is scheduled to make his third rehab
start for Triple-A Oklahoma on Friday at Nashville.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 4, Angels 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Leyritz hit a two-out, RBI single in the
10th inning after Adrian Beltre tripled to lift the Los Angeles
Dodgers over the Anaheim Angels 4-3 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's one-out triple off Al Levine (1-1) went into the
right-field corner. Anaheim then brought left fielder Darin Erstad
into the left side of the infield, leaving three fielders between
third base and second, and Kevin Elster grounded out to Erstad as
Beltre held.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad then returned to left field, and Leyritz drove the ball
to deep right-center as Beltre easily scored.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Osuna (2-4) retired all three batters he faced in the
10th.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had tied the score at 3 in the seventh on Shawn
Green's RBI single off Shigetoshi Hasegawa, a run partially created
when Paul LoDuca's one-out grounder got past Mo Vaughn at first for
an error.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus, coming off his first All-Star appearance, had
connected on Carlos Perez's first pitch to him in the seventh for
his 26th home run and a 3-2 lead. Garret Anderson had just led off
the inning with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield had given the Dodgers a 2-0 lead in the third
with a two-run homer off Ken Hill in the third inning. Sheffield's
home run, his club-high 28th, came after LoDuca's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels closed to 2-1 on Bengie Molina's RBI single in the
fifth after Los Angeles center fielder Todd Hollandsworth misplayed
Glaus' leadoff drive to center into a double.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth first started to turn to his right, then spun to
his left as he tried to get back to catch the line drive. He then
seemed to lose sight of the ball and it dropped behind him. Molina
followed with his run-scoring single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Perez gave up three runs and nine hits in his seven innings. He
has walked only two in his last 19 1-3 innings spanning three
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Hill allowed two runs and four hits in six innings. He struck
out eight, including Green three times, and walked five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Angels pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, who hasn't pitched since
June 16 because of a strained rib cage, is to make his first rehab
start Friday night for Class-A Lake Elsinore against San
Bernardino. He will be limited to 50-60 pitches. ... Anaheim won
the 1999 season series against the Dodgers 4-2. ... Matt Herges was
been the surprise star of the Dodgers' bullpen in the first half of
the season. The 30-year-old rookie reliever is 6-0 with a 3.27 ERA
over his 52 1-3 innings. ... Dodgers C Todd Hundley is expected to
miss the next few games because of a broken right thumb. The
switch-hitting Hundley will remain available for pinch-hitting duty
from the left side of the plate. ... Los Angeles shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek has missed the last four games because of a viral
illness and probably will be placed on the 15-day DL.

<HEADLINE> Critics Denounce 'Jaws' Ads  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Jaws'' movie posters displayed on beach
trash cans and lifeguard stations have critics snapping that the
toothy posters frighten children.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters and beachgoers who don't speak English might mistake
the advertisements for a warning, they argue, even though shark
attacks are virtually unheard of here.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is offensive. Certainly, it's inappropriate,'' said beach
activist Howard Bennett. He said his 3-year-old granddaughter
refused to swim after seeing an ad on a trash barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The posters are part of a national ad campaign promoting this
week's release of ''Jaws'' on digital video disc, or DVD, 25 years
after the debut of the horror movie about a giant shark that
terrorizes a New England resort.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, a version of the original movie poster, features the
''Jaws'' title in big red letters, along with the snout of a gaping
great white. The poster appears on about 400 beach trash bins and
dozens of lifeguard towers in Ventura, Orange, and Los Angeles
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was focusing on the fact that this was recognizable. ... It
was just part of the American culture,'' said Kerry Gottlieb, chief
deputy director of the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and
Harbors. ''I certainly didn't want to have anybody be afraid or
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   One poster on a Santa Monica lifeguard station is on a sign
urging ''Swim Near Lifeguard'' that includes warnings about
riptides and keeping dogs off the beach.
</P>
<P>
   No one has complained to Universal Studios, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads surfaced June 19 and will come down July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gotten nothing but positive feedback,'' said Greg
Wooden, vice president of marketing for Adopt A Beach, which
provides Los Angeles County with trash barrels and contracts with
other companies to place ads.
</P>
<P>
   At Playa del Rey, the ads didn't seem to keep anyone away
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's kind of funny,'' said Ashli Hutchison, sunbathing
with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Chase Sutton said the ads didn't keep him from
swimming, but, he added, ''Little kids might think, 'Oh, there are
sharks in the ocean.'''

<HEADLINE> Former Starr Aide on Trial  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two former aides to Kenneth Starr say the
spokesman for the independent counsel's office, Charles Bakaly III,
misled a judge when he initially denied any role in news leaks
during President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly's lawyers, in the opening day of his contempt trial
Thursday, got one of the lawyers to admit that some information
provided by the former spokesman was left out of a key court
submission that led to the criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was to continue Friday before U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson, who was hearing the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Former Starr deputy Solomon Wisenberg testified Thursday he
became concerned to learn that Bakaly had admitted to the FBI that
he was a source for some of the information in a January 1999 New
York Times story. Written during Clinton's trial in the Senate, the
article said Starr concluded he had constitutional authority to
indict a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks before his FBI interview, Bakaly had submitted a
sworn statement to Johnson denying he had confirmed any information
to the reporter who wrote the story or was one of the unnamed Starr
''associates'' quoted in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ''My problem was Bakaly admitting he was one of the Starr
'associates' referred to in the Times article,'' Wisenberg
testified, calling the story a ''ham-handed attempt to influence
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg, testifying against his former aide, said Bakaly's
account to the FBI was ''inconsistent with what he told me. He
denied he told me he wasn't an 'associate.'''
</P>
<P>
   The defense elicited a key concession from one of the Starr
lawyers who helped prepare Bakaly's sworn statement.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Bucklin said he didn't include all the information Bakaly
had provided to him in the original court statement, because he
didn't want it to fall into the hands of Clinton lawyer David
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kendall was pursuing allegations of illegal grand
jury leaks against Starr's office. ''I couldn't show that to David
Kendall,'' Bucklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucklin said he omitted Bakaly's material initially because the
leak investigation was at a preliminary stage. More comprehensive
statements denying leaks were submitted later but only to the
judge, Bucklin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bucklin also testified that Bakaly changed his story over
time. The spokesman originally ''assured me that he was not'' the
source for any information in a New York Times article during the
Senate trial, Bucklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Bakaly was responsible for Starr's office
submitting court papers, prepared by Bucklin, denying it was a
source for the Jan. 21, 1999 article.
</P>
<P>
   Bucklin said the independent counsel's original denial was ''put
together almost exclusively'' from Bakaly's information. He later
was forced to ''withdraw the entire argument that the OIC (Office
of independent counsel) was not the source.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''new information'' about Bakaly's role came not only from
the spokesman's later admissions, Bucklin said, but from FBI
investigators and from Wisenberg
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly is not accused of leaking any improper information that
was covered by grand jury secrecy rules, simply accused of
misleading the court about his role.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor John Griffith told the court Thursday that Bakaly
''had been a source or the source of a lot of the information in
the article.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly admits he provided the Times with a Watergate-era
memorandum on indicting a sitting president and a copy of Starr's
congressional testimony on the subject. The former spokesman said
this was part of an effort to steer the Times away from writing
about the deliberations in Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Bucklin was asked whether Bakaly told
investigators he provided the historical information to ''steer''
the reporter away from the story. ''I'm not sure it was to steer
him away,'' Bucklin answered.
</P>
<P>
   When defense lawyers pointed to internal Starr notes backing
Bakaly's version, Bucklin said he wasn't disputing the notes but
''I don't remember it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Bids Farewell To NAACP  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- In 1992, Bill Clinton's ties to the nation's
largest civil rights group were initiated in the heat of
controversy stirred by an opponent's political gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot, addressing the
NAACP convention in Nashville, Tenn., strained to convey to his
black audience exactly who was being hurt by the nation's economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Perot's campaign, the candidate on several
occasions used the distancing term ''you people'' to get his
message across. People began to question Perot's racial
sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   Before the same audience hours later, Clinton, the fresh-faced
Arkansas governor, introduced his freshly minted vice presidential
choice, Al Gore, to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech pegged to Perot's fumble, Clinton used the term
''we'' more than a dozen times to describe his vision for America
and how black Americans would play a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address, sprinkled with homespun stories of his
growing up with black friends and confidantes, drew a tremendous
ovation from the thousands there.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as Clinton gave his final speech as president to
the NAACP at the closing of the group's annual convention, memories
of 1992 flooded back to Benjamin Hooks, then the group's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a wonderful day for Clinton. You could feel he
made friends that day,'' Hooks said.
</P>
<P>
   That friendship and record high opinion poll numbers with black
America lasted through Clinton's six visits to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- even through
tough times like Clinton's public abandonment of Lani Guinier, his
nominee to run the Justice Department's civil rights division,
through his implementation of a welfare overhaul and through his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a touch of melancholy in the air for many as
Clinton spoke Thursday and provided the send-off for the
organization's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some pointed to Clinton's hardscrabble upbringing, others his
youth and still others noted the racial and ethnic diversity among
his advisers. But regardless of the reason, it was nearly
impossible to find someone not saying good things about the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad because I don't think we will ever see another
president like him,'' said Sandra Murdock of St. Louis. ''He was an
outsider when he got to Washington. He didn't come from a powerful
family or special privileges. He understands what it's like to come
from the bottom like a lot of people here do.''
</P>
<P>
   W. Jeanne Cummings of Long Island, N.Y., said, ''He's part of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I rushed up to the front so I could shake his hand because I
think he's walked in our shoes. He has known hard times,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Tracy Jacobs said she was sad Clinton was leaving
because she believes he is the only national leader who would
directly confront racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of white people are scared to talk to black people
honestly,'' Jacobs said. ''But he's in touch with us. It's not
something you can manufacture. Either you are born with it or you
aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the occasion to promote Gore as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a lot of vice presidents, a lot of vice presidents
made great presidents -- Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, Harry
Truman, Lyndon Johnson,'' Clinton said. ''But we've never had a
vice president that did so much good as vice president as Al Gore --
never, not ever in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the audience wondered whether Gore would be able to
maintain Clinton's popularity with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore received a much more enthusiastic response from the
audience Wednesday than that given Monday to his chief rival for
the presidency, Republican George W. Bush, some in the audience
said they feared a ''Clinton-letdown'' in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish they could just bottle whatever it is Clinton has and
sprinkle it all over Mr. Gore,'' said Odessa Jackson of Cheraw,
S.C. ''I'm going with Gore because he's the Democrat, but I think I
see some Clinton letdown coming. He's almost like having one of us
there in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Clinton's close relationship with the NAACP has
caused a slight dilemma for the group, which, because of its
tax-exempt nature, must remain non-political.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, the NAACP's national board chairman, acknowledged
as much in introducing Clinton when he said that while the
organization does not endorse candidates or political parties, it
had a special tie with the man leaving the White House in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know how to recognize our friends, and the president is our
friend,'' Bond said to loud cheers.

<HEADLINE> Secrecy Shrouds Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Entering a fourth day of Mideast
negotiations at secluded Camp David, U.S. mediators expressed
dogged determination to move the talks forward -- and an equally
fervent desire to maintain a veil of secrecy over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal here ... is to try to make these talks successful,''
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said after Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright -- sitting in Thursday for President
Clinton -- met with senior negotiators from both sides and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Having extracted pledges of silence from summit participants,
U.S. officials repeated with what has become their Camp David
mantra: The less said about how things are going, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not trying to characterize optimism or pessimism at any
given moment,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the sidelines of the talks, non-negotiators spoke freely,
with the Palestinians' unofficial spokeswoman expressing pessimism
as to whether any headway could be made.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are not easy issues,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, referring to
the so-called core disputes -- the status of Jerusalem, which both
sides claim as their capital; the fate of more than 2 million
Palestinian refugees displaced by the creation of the state of
Israel; and the boundaries of any future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of addressing Jerusalem and refugees and the
boundaries, they still have not been resolved,'' Ashrawi said. ''I
doubt they will be successful in this time period.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants were working against a Sept. 13 deadline for
signing an accord. The Palestinians have said they would declare
statehood that day, treaty or no treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said it does not want to impose any
''artificial deadline'' on the length of the summit, but Clinton is
scheduled to leave Wednesday for a meeting in Japan of
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic sources indicated the talks so far had been intensive
and serious, but had not produced a breakthrough on any of the core
issues.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. spokesmen have said nothing about the substance of
negotiations, alluding only to the fact that the two sides were
''grappling'' and ''struggling'' to resolve extremely difficult
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was away from Camp David for about eight hours Thursday,
handing off the role of lead mediator to Albright. Asked why the
secretary met with Barak but not Arafat, Boucher said only that
U.S. mediators were doing what they thought best to move the talks
forward.
</P>
<P>
   During his break from the talks, Clinton attended a White House
signing ceremony for a U.S. trade agreement with Vietnam, where he
expressed hopes that old enmities could be put aside in the Middle
East as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Former adversaries can come together to find common ground in
a way that benefits all their people, to let go of the past and
embrace the future, to forgive and to reconcile,'' he said before
flying back to the presidential retreat for a group dinner and to
spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the pace of talks may be affected by the
Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown
Saturday, and the Muslim holy day, Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware of the religious obligations of the parties as
they make them known to us, and we will make sure that the plan of
activities takes those into account,'' Boucher said, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Palestinians would be able to go ahead
with plans for a ''leadership meeting,'' which would include three
senior PLO officials -- all sometime critics of Arafat -- who
traveled to the United States and are staying in the Washington
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not aware that there's been a request to bring in
political leaders,'' said Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, seeking to build a broad base of support for any accord
reached, brought a large entourage in addition to the negotiators
in residence at Camp David, the Navy-run presidential retreat
tucked away in the Catoctin Mountains, 90 miles from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has added a delegate to its negotiating team, Boucher
confirmed Thursday. Israeli officials identified him as Dan
Meridor, the chairman of the committee in Israel's parliament that
deals with military and foreign affairs.

<HEADLINE> Deal Readies Vietnam For Reform  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- A historic trade pact between the United
States and Vietnam marks a victory for the free-market reformers in
this communist nation and could be the biggest boost to its
struggling economy in years.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after they went to war, Vietnam and the United
States signed a deal Thursday in Washington under which Vietnamese
goods and services will gain access to the world's largest market
under the same system of low tariffs enjoyed by most nations.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Hanoi will implement measures to open up Vietnam's
state-controlled markets to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Trade Minister Vu Khoan praised the deal, reached
after four years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Internationally, this is an important step in our integration
into the world economy,'' he said on state television.
</P>
<P>
   For this poverty-stricken communist nation of 76 million people,
the impact is potentially as far-reaching and profound as the
market-oriented reforms that reversed Vietnam's virtual collapse
from collectivized farming in the mid-1980s, said analysts and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the short term, it instantly restores the sense that
Vietnam continues to move forward with international integration
and economic reform,'' said Virginia Foote, president of the
U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is sure to restore economic momentum to the country,
which has seen growth in its goods and services cut in half in
recent years and foreign investment pledges tumble 85 percent from
peaks of $8 billion before the Asian financial crisis began in 1997
to under $2 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of commerce, the effects could be immediate for
Vietnamese businesses, as U.S. tariffs averaging 40 percent will
drop below 3 percent under normal trading relations. The World Bank
has estimated that the trade pact could bring an estimated $800
million to Hanoi's annual export revenues in the first year alone.
Currently, the biggest export from Vietnam to the United States is
coffee, but exports of shoes and textiles are expected to climb
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a good opportunity for our products to penetrate
the huge U.S. market,'' said Vu Ngan Gian, export manager of Ho Chi
Minh City-based Hiep Hung Leather and Footwear, which exports some
$10 million of leather goods to the European Union. ''We have been
approached by some American companies in the past, but in the
absence of normal trading relations, we could not compete with
Chinese exports.''
</P>
<P>
   For American businesses already in Vietnam, including Nike Inc.,
lower U.S. tariffs could provide incentive to manufacture more
goods here. The footwear giant currently produces about 10 percent
to 12 percent of its total goods in Vietnam, said Chris Helzer,
Nike's director of government affairs for Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't increase our overall production, but it makes
factories in Vietnam as competitive as Thailand or Indonesia,'' he
said. ''That is something we'd look at.''
</P>
<P>
   By removing the last commercial vestige of the Vietnam War, the
pact also completes the process of normalization that began five
years ago when diplomatic ties were reestablished between the
former foes. The reconciliation process has been the top priority
for U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson, a former prisoner of war, since
he took office in 1997 as the first postwar ambassador to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the deal, which still must be ratified by the
U.S. Congress and reviewed annually, would fundamentally change
Vietnam's way of doing business, introducing an unprecedented level
of competition and financial openness.
</P>
<P>
   It requires that trade barriers be lowered, state industries
compete with foreign companies, and copyright and investment
guarantees be raised to international levels.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to Hanoi's fears that competition by American
companies will overwhelm domestic industries, U.S. firms will
initially have restricted access to Vietnam's banking, insurance,
telecommunications, tourism and technical services markets. But
there is a clear timetable in place for complete access.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the bilateral trade agreement was the crucial
litmus test for Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, which has been
internally divided over the merits of opening its markets to global
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' final ratification may not happen until late this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the psychological boost of a signed deal shouldn't be
underestimated, said Peter Ryder, head of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hanoi. The trade deal, coupled with next week's opening
of Vietnam's first postwar stock market, could trigger a new
infusion of foreign capital here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing couldn't be better in that sense,'' said Ryder, a
businessman who arrived in Vietnam in the early 1990s. ''It's the
clearest signal in years that Vietnam is finally on the move.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. Officials Probe Assisted Living  </HEADLINE>
By BILL POOVEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- One 64-year-old resident wandered out of
an assisted-living facility and fell from a bluff to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, this one 92, climbed out a window and ended up in a
field where he died in freezing temperatures. A third died after he
reportedly didn't receive appropriate medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths and hundreds of complaints against assisted-living
homes in Alabama highlight problems regulating a growing national
industry that officials here say is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   A state license to operate an assisted-living home ''isn't worth
the price of the Scotch tape it took to stick it on the wall,''
said Paul Hamrick, a top aide to Gov. Don Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials have complaints against almost 200
unlicensed assisted-living homes. Inspectors say they have
discovered abuse and neglect, including residents tied to chairs as
punishment and others with untreated broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   With only three state inspectors to check standards of care,
living conditions range from upscale communities with plushly
decorated clubhouses to overcrowded, slum-like operations in
doublewide trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is here and it is getting worse every day,''
conceded Tommy McDougal, director of the 246-member Assisted Living
Association of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives agreed Thursday to proposed tougher
rules to protect residents, increased fees and stiffer penalties in
response to the governor's threat to end state oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I refuse to hear any more horror stories of abuse and neglect
at licensed and unlicensed facilities in this state,'' Siegelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   More talks were scheduled for Friday, and some of the proposals
were to be presented next week to the state health board.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't just deregulate and abandon,'' said Dick Short, a
legislative liaison for the American Association of Retired Persons
in Alabama. ''We are anxious to see them work out something.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government doesn't regulate assisted-living homes as
it does nursing homes, which provide 24-hour medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Assisted living is one of the fastest growing housing options
for the aged, serving as a medium between their own home and a full
nursing facility. In many cases, including in Alabama, assisted
living costs about half as much as nursing homes and some states do
not require a license before a facility may open.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the industry -- made up of 25,000 to 30,000 homes --
cares for about 600,000 people. That includes 8,000 residents in
Alabama's more than 300 assisted-living homes, which mostly offer
meals, light housekeeping, laundry services and social activities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Williamson, Alabama's health officer, said deregulating
the facilities would remove an appearance of the state putting its
stamp of approval on abusive treatment and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of deregulating, if that means taking away basic
health and safety protections, that could be a big problem,'' said
Steve McConnell, a vice president of the Alzheimer's Association in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama forbids assisted-living homes from keeping residents who
have Alzheimer's or other severe dementia, but health officials
contend the rule is largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were to go and attempt to enforce that, nobody is sure
where the number would be, but several thousand assisted-living
residents would have to leave,'' said Rick Harris, the state's
chief of health provider standards. ''There is no place to put
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of Barney McNabb and William Trice, both with
Alzheimer's disease, attracted attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking out a window, Trice wandered away from a home in
Huntsville to a field where he collapsed and died in January.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb left the Oak Trace Lodge Assisted Living Facility in
Cullman County, climbed over a fence and fell from a bluff. His
body was found June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama health officials said they sent a license revocation
letter Wednesday to owners of the Golden Oaks home in Harpersville,
where a resident became bedridden, lost 40 pounds over several
months and died.
</P>
<P>
   An inspection report showed that the resident never received
''skilled medical care'' recommended by a doctor. Siegelman
requested a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked for an investigation of the Shady Oaks
assisted-living home in Albertville where inspectors discovered
''improper sexual behavior between residents who likely are not
cognitively capable of consenting to such contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gary Lane nor Rudy Southerland, co-owners of the two
homes, could be reached Thursday by telephone for comment.

<HEADLINE> Gore Reminded of Nader Threat  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- The gymnasium was stifling, the questions
even hotter as Al Gore went looking for good campaign-commercial
footage and found, instead, the specter of Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   At a town-hall meeting in this battleground state, some 200
skeptically undecided voters also forced the vice president to
defend his advocacy of the death penalty, his push for free trade
with China, even his wife's decades-old drive for parental warning
labels on music with obscene lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Y'all are certainly asking easy questions this evening,'' he
joked halfway through the nearly three-hour forum. A film crew had
outfitted the un-air-conditioned school gymnasium with studio
lights to collect fodder for future campaign or Democratic National
Committee TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   There was praise for the Democratic presidential candidate,
sure, but some voter comment was far from flattering.
</P>
<P>
   One woman sternly admonished: ''It has felt to me like the
Clinton-Gore administration gave an awful lot of ground back to the
right and I would like to know why I should vote for you and not
Ralph Nader. And don't tell me, 'Because I'll split the vote.
That's not an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The question -- plus another woman's counsel, ''You ought to be
acknowledging more that there are more than two candidates in this
race.'' -- come at a time when polls suggest that Nader is a growing
threat to Gore's support from the left, including in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Couillard, a special education teacher and union member,
said he could never vote for Bush but was flirting with a vote for
Nader. He said he was impressed with Gore as ''very genuine,'' but
didn't want to hear any evidence that Gore improperly handled his
1996 fund raising or he would vote for Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I ever found out that (Gore) was in somebody's pocket that
would be it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore camp has recently made quiet entreaties to top
Nader backers, Gore avoided speaking his rival's name in answering
questions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic success that has come with the Clinton-Gore
policies has helped working families far better than slogans, far
more than rhetoric,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In this working-class city 96 miles north of Detroit, where the
national prosperity has not spread so thickly, several voters poked
holes in Gore's proud record of economic success and complained of
high taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had more jobs, but they're not as good jobs,'' one woman
said.
</P>
<P>
   An autoworker complained that Gore's support for free trade with
China threatened to rob him of his job. Gore said he thought
America and the autoworker were better off if the nation was open
to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his opposition to eliminating taxes on capital
gains, saying that 90 percent of that kind of tax relief benefits
only the small slice of America's wealthiest taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about ''censorship'' and wife Tipper's 1980s crusade
to warn parents against obscene or violent rock lyrics, Gore
defended her, too -- and said the record warning labels now
routinely used only assist good parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the arguments of people who say that can have a
chilling effect on the creative community. But I don't think it's
fair for them to insist upon on open spigot to deprive parents of
the chance to do that,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   A retired black minister, who voiced confidence Gore would win
the White House, nonetheless chastised him for supporting the death
penalty and insisted upon hearing Gore's plan for making sure that
convicts on death row ''get every access to prove they are innocent
before they are killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated a position he's had to air several times since the
accuracy of death-penalty convictions and the efficient rate of
executions in Texas under Bush's governorship have been called into
question.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he supports legislation requiring the use of DNA
evidence, when available, in capital cases, and also a moratorium
on executions in states that find a high error rate in convictions.
Illinois, where the governor has already imposed a moratorium, is
the only example Gore gave.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, before calling it a night and returning to Washington,
Gore was asked to defend his very style.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who indicated she likes Gore's politics said he's been
so low-profile as vice president that she's had to question whether
he is ''strong enough to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where have you been for the past eight years?'' the woman
asked, as Gore chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   He replied that the vice presidency is a ''mixed blessing'' that
had forced him to take a back seat in order ''to help him be the
best president he can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it like the woman behind the man?'' he said. ''Well, you
know, actually, I've learned a lot about some of those issues.''

<HEADLINE> New Way Found To ID Web Customers  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the ongoing search for a way to positively
identify a customer on the Internet, a credit reporting leader
plans to use customers' credit records to quiz them on their
identities when they want to sign up for the Checkfree online
bill-paying service.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies of every sort have grappled with the ID
issue, using a number of tactics. Biometrics, the practice of using
a person's physical traits as identification markers, has gained
notoriety with its sci-fi scans of fingerprints, eye retinas and
irises, and even the space between two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta-based Equifax, one of the ''big three'' credit
reporting agencies, has signed a deal with Checkfree to use its
authentication engine to verify identity.
</P>
<P>
   After a potential Checkfree customer enters a name, address,
birth date and Social Security number, Checkfree sends that
information to Equifax, which uses it to pull up the person's
credit report. Then Equifax sends back a set of multiple-choice
questions, such as which bank financed the person's car loan, and
how much their mortgage payment is.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax says this is a secure way to quickly identify a person,
rather than Checkfree's old way that requires the company to send a
potential customer a key number back in the ''real world'' through
the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our strategy is to provide safety, security and privacy for
Internet commerce transactions,'' said Rich Crutchfield, who heads
Equifax's e-commerce unit.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax does more for Checkfree than another potential customer.
Since Checkfree is a service designed to pay bills over the Web,
the user normally has to enter account information for utilities,
loans and other outstanding bills. But since a customer's credit
record already has that information, Equifax can fill those in
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The automatically entered information does not include the
outstanding balance or repayment details, which under federal law
cannot be divulged to third parties without the consumer's
permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes the application process for Checkfree easier for the
consumer,'' Crutchfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions involving a credit report are encrypted and
only take place between the user and Equifax. Checkfree never gets
information about a person's credit rating, according to
Crutchfield.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax asks questions about car loans, student loans or similar
creditors because that information usually can't be gotten by
stealing someone's wallet, Crutchfield said. Customers are also
warned, and allowed to use a method that doesn't involve their
credit record. Like brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce is a
difficult balance between speed and quality, Crutchfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers want instant gratification, but on the other hand
they're very concerned about safety and privacy on the Internet,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, gave the scheme a conditional approval as far as
privacy is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short, this is potentially one of the less objectionable
ways of verifying identity, provided that the information that's
being sent to Equifax is not shared with any third party, including
Checkfree,'' Steinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with computer hacking tools that allow a malicious person
to spy on the very keystrokes of a victim, Steinhardt said
consumers shouldn't worry so much about Equifax's program.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a Checkfree customer and running online bill
payment, you're running a risk by interception by a cracker in any
event,'' he said. ''This is one of the less risky events'' since
it's encrypted.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on speedy acceptance of credit reports-as-ID anytime
soon, though. Customers are bound to be skeptical when faced with a
quiz about their car loans from years ago, and Steinhardt is still
skeptical as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The devil in these things is always in the details,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Girls Dies After Being Locked in Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- Heat is being blamed for the death of a
2-year-old girl who accidentally locked herself in a car as
temperatures reached 102 degrees Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be totally accidental,'' said Lt. Mike Linder of
the Yellowstone County sheriff's department. ''It looks like the
girl got into the car and couldn't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary reports indicate the girl was playing around the car
when she entered the vehicle and the door closed.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's name was being withheld, said Keith Montgomery,
Yellowstone County Coroner.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was scheduled for Friday.

<HEADLINE> Judge Resorts To Ruling in Poetry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- One judge here isn't averse to a little
verse.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in his career, Superior Court Judge J.
Michael Eakin has written an opinion in rhyming verse. In May 1999,
Eakin upheld the prenuptial agreement of a divorcing couple in a
series of rhyming couplets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Eakin used 121 lines of verse to deny an appeal by a
man who had been ordered to pay $1,155 in veterinarian bills after
hitting a miniature poodle with his car.
</P>
<P>
   A county judge ruled Sipula was negligent and responsible.
Sipula appealed to Superior Court, insisting the dog owner was at
fault for walking the dogs in the street.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Eakin penned his poem. It concluded:
</P>
<P>
   So while counsel raises issues that are worthy and well taken
</P>
<P>
   in the end, we find the effort to apply them here's mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   We must conclude the issues raised do not warrant a new trial
</P>
<P>
   and all that we may offer now is this respectful, rhymed denial.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no reason you have to be dull,'' the judge said. ''Too
often, judges and lawyers write in stilted Latin and use big words
just to use them, and it isn't necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipula's attorney, William Askin, said he was considering an
appeal -- but not because of the way Eakin expressed the court's
findings. ''I have no problem with a well-written opinion,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Wants AIDS-Pregnancy Policy  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Former President Nelson Mandela
called Friday for a stepped-up government fight against
mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus, a topic that has
brought South Africa under a crush of international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need bold initiatives to prevent new infections among young
people, and large-scale actions to prevent mother-to-child
transmission,'' Mandela told thousands of cheering delegates at the
closing of the 13th International AIDS Conference in the coastal
city of Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and AIDS activists from around the world have
criticized South African President Thabo Mbeki's controversial AIDS
policies. The country has refused to make available medication that
was proven to reduce the chance of mother-to-child transmission of
the disease, and Mbeki has cited fringe scientists who question
whether HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela called for both sides to end their argument. He said
they should concentrate on fighting the disease that already
infects 24 million Africans and is predicted to claim the lives of
millions more in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much unnecessary attention around this conference had been
directed toward a dispute that is unintentionally distracting from
the real life-and-death issues we are confronted with as a country
... a region, a continent and a world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the face of the grave threat posed by HIV/AIDS, we have to
rise above our differences and combine our efforts to save our
people. History will judge us harshly if we fail to do so now, and
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates gave Mandela's speech a standing ovation.
Conference chairman Hoosen Coovadia called it ''music to our
ears.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 scientists, doctors and AIDS workers attended
the weeklong conference -- the first held in Africa, where 70
percent of the world's 34 million AIDS sufferers live.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us not equivocate: A tragedy of unprecedented proportions
is unfolding in Africa,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is destroying families, overwhelming health care systems
and destroying education systems as both students and teachers
across the continent die, he said. He called on the South African
government to treat the opportunistic infections that prey on AIDS
sufferers, care for affected children and work to dispel the
paralyzing stigma that surrounds AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stigma and discrimination can be stopped, new infections can
be prevented and the capacity of families and communities to care
for people living with HIV and AIDS can be enhanced,'' he said.
''The challenge is to move from rhetoric to action, and action on
an unprecedented scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela called for increasing African resolve to fight the
disease, but also stressed the need for an international
partnership. At a news conference before the speech, Mandela
accepted a $5 million gift from the United States Agency for
International Development to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund.

<HEADLINE> Senate Mulls Inheritance Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming for tens of billions of dollars in
election-year tax breaks, the Senate neared passage of a Republican
bill that would phase out estate taxes in defiance of President
Clinton's veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would repeal the 102-year-old federal excise
tax on telephone service, cut taxes paid by some Social Security
beneficiaries and provide tax relief to farmers. It was possible,
however, that these amendments to the inheritance tax measure could
be removed from the bill and wind up as mainly symbolic gestures.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate balked at adding another popular provision to the
bill. An amendment by Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., to suspend the
18.3-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax until after the November
elections was defeated 59-40. Abraham said the temporary tax
reduction was needed to lower high fuel prices. Opponents said it
would jeopardize money for road building and other transportation
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Republican supporters said the estate tax, which reaches a top
rate of 55 percent, hinders investment and job creation, forces
millions of people to do costly estate planning and particularly
hurts farmers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''No family, no farm and no business should have to worry about
this sort of thing,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House in June, would cut the top 55
percent estate tax rate in 2001 and then gradually phase out all
other rates, with full repeal coming in 2010. The cost was
estimated at $105 billion during the phaseout, ballooning to $750
billion in the decade after repeal would be in effect fully.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the government's revenue loss would be
cushioned somewhat because the bill changes the way assets are
valued -- known as basis -- so that an heir would owe higher
capital-gains taxes than under current law once an inherited asset
is sold. Capital-gains tax rates, however, are much lower than
estate tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It removes death as the trigger for any tax,'' Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., said of the repeal bill.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the big cost of repeal and the fact that heirs of
only 2 percent of people who die pay estate taxes was evidence that
Republicans wanted mainly to help the rich. In 1997, for example,
only 43,000 estates out of 2.7 million adult deaths were subject to
the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't disguise what you're doing here in terms of a large
tax cut for the wealthiest people in the United States,'' said Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate voted 53-46 against a Democratic substitute
costing $64 billion over 10 years that would have sharply raised
estate tax exemptions -- now $675,000 per individual -- particularly
for the farmers and small businesses that are hurt the most.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Clinton would
certainly veto the bill and that Democrats would be able to sustain
it. ''This isn't going anyplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides used the debate to highlight some of their other tax
cut priorities. In some cases, the votes were intended mainly for
political consumption by senators up for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   In votes Thursday, the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   --Approved, 97-3, an amendment by Roth to repeal on Sept. 1 the 3
percent excise tax on telephone service that dates from the
Spanish-American War. A House-passed version would phase out repeal
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   --Approved, 58-41, an amendment by Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., that
would repeal a 1993 law imposing income taxes on 85 percent,
instead of 50 percent, of Social Security benefits for people with
earnings over $34,000 for a single taxpayer, $44,000 for a married
couple.
</P>
<P>
   --Approved on a voice vote an amendment by Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, giving several tax breaks to farmers, including creation of
tax-deferred accounts in which they could deposit up to 20 percent
of their earnings. The measure also would repeal a law passed last
year forcing small businesses to pay income taxes on certain sales
immediately, even if the buyers were paying in installments.
</P>
<P>
   --Voted 98-1 to make the business research and development tax
credit permanent. It was extended last year for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Abolition of the estate tax is a top priority for Republicans
and several powerful lobbying groups, including the National
Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of
Manufacturers and the American Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   It is supported by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
GOP presidential nominee, and is certain to be an issue in the fall
presidential and congressional campaigns if Clinton follows through
on his veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 8.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose in early trading Friday after new
government data showed inflationary pressures remain under control,
boosting investors hopes that the Federal Reserve is done raising
interest rates this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.81 at 10,814.52 in
the opening minutes of trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up
45.22 at 4,229.08 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.63
at 1,503.47.
</P>
<P>
   With little earnings news reported Friday, investors were
instead focusing on three reports that provided more evidence of a
slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers,
rose 0.6 percent in June. While that gain was bigger than expected,
it mostly was due a sharp rise in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which
doesn't include energy or food costs, fell an unexpected 0.1
percent in June, the best showing since January.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, retail sales rose by a slightly
bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent in June, but excluding the
volatile automobiles category sales rose just 0.2 percent, weaker
than expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a third report, industrial production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose an expected 0.2 percent in
June, the slowest pace since September.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports showed that the Federal Reserve's six
interest-rate hikes over the last year were cooling off the
economy's pace and keeping inflation under control. That helped
ease investors' fears that the Fed will raise rates again this
year.

<HEADLINE> ABC Allowed To Interview Kevorkian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A judge has ordered the state Department of
Corrections to allow ABC News an on-camera interview with jailed
assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Director Bill Martin refused the network's request
to interview Kevorkian and two other inmates in April 1999. ABC
sued, alleging the department arbitrarily and unconstitutionally
applied a new policy barring cameras and recording devices in the
state's 39 prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee County Circuit Judge Robert Ransom on Thursday ordered
Martin to allow the ABC newsmagazine ''20/20'' to bring its cameras
into the state prison and tape the interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Ransom agreed with the department's decision to keep the
other two inmates out of the TV camera's view.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Friday as
investors remained cautious despite new government data that showed
inflationary pressures remain under control.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 10.60 at 10,778.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were slightly higher. The Nasdaq
composite index was up 21.09 at 4,195.95 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 3.54 at 1,499.38.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors stayed on the sidelines on Friday ahead of next
week, when many companies will report their second-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The market on Friday focused mainly on three new reports that
provided more evidence of a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers,
rose 0.6 percent in June. While that gain was bigger than expected,
it mostly was due a sharp rise in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which
doesn't include energy or food costs, fell an unexpected 0.1
percent in June, the best showing since January.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, retail sales rose by a slightly
bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent in June, but excluding the
volatile automobiles category sales rose just 0.2 percent, weaker
than expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a third report, industrial production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose an expected 0.2 percent in
June, the slowest pace since September.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports showed that the Federal Reserve's six
interest-rate hikes over the past year were cooling off the
economy's pace and keeping inflation under control. That helped
ease investors' fears that the Fed will raise rates again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 134.57 million
shares, down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.81 at 541.95.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.62 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.83 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.16 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia, US To End Satellite Quotas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia and the United States have agreed to lift
quotas that control how many U.S. commercial satellites can be
launched using Russian booster rockets, the Russian Aerospace
Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The existing pact stipulates that American companies can launch
no more than 20 satellites aboard Russian rockets each year. But
the pact expires Dec. 31, and in consultations several weeks ago,
the two sides decided not to renew it, the agency said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The sides decided not to announce the change until after
Wednesday's launch of a service module for the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   The quota system was introduced in 1993 amid U.S. concerns that
Russia would offer to put satellites in orbit at below-market
prices. Washington also had concerns about the reliability of
Russian launch technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the demand for commercial satellite launches has grown, and
Russia's Proton-K rocket has proved to be one of the world's most
reliable. Russia has also kept its launch prices within market
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Russia receives about $70 million for a satellite launch -- a
coveted source of revenue for the cash-strapped government.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Eyewitness Karski Dies  </HEADLINE>
By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Jan Karski, a former Polish diplomat who
provided early eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the West
during World War II, has died. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Karski died Thursday at Georgetown University Hospital in
Washington, D.C., a university spokeswoman said. The Polish embassy
there confirmed that he died of heart and kidney ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jan Kozielewski in 1914 in the central industrial Polish
city of Lodz, he joined the Polish diplomatic service in 1935 and
served as artillery officer in the September 1939 campaign against
the Nazi invasion. He was captured by the Red Army after the
Soviets invaded Poland from the East a few weeks later, but escaped
to join the underground.
</P>
<P>
   His excellent memory and courage made him a courier. As an
officer in the Polish resistance, he made four runs to the West
with reports from underground leaders to the exiled Polish
government. He was captured in Slovakia in 1940 and tortured by the
Nazi Gestapo, but he escaped with the help of Polish partisans who
attacked the prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, disguised as a Nazi guard, Karski sneaked into the
Izbica death camp in eastern Poland and twice entered the Warsaw
Ghetto, where he witnessed mass killing and torture of Jews. He
brought his story to the West, briefing political and religious
leaders in London and then meeting personally with President
Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Karski's report, and pressure from the Polish exiles, led to the
Allies' 1942 statement condemning German crimes against the Jews.
But in the months that followed, when Karski tried to tell his
stories to Allied leaders, they reacted with silence and took no
concrete action, Karski said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe they did not believe, maybe they thought I was
exaggerating,'' he said in a 1995 interview with The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''Roosevelt did not show any feelings, did not make any
comment,'' he recalled. ''He told me to repeat in Poland that the
Allies will win the war and that the criminals will be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Story of a Secret State,'' a book Karski wrote about the
resistance movement, life in occupied Poland and Nazi atrocities,
first appeared in 1944 in the United States and became a
bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, communist leaders seeking to claim all credit for
opposing and ousting the Nazis denied the existence of the Polish
underground Home Army, which operated on orders from democratic
Poland's government-in-exile in London. Thousands of Home Army
fighters were jailed and many were sentenced to death on charges
fabricated by the communists.
</P>
<P>
   Karski settled in the United States and lectured on
international affairs at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire Georgetown University community is grateful and
proud that he chose to share his gifts with us for nearly forty
years,'' the Rev. Leo J. O'Donovan, Georgetown's president, said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Only after communism fell in 1989 was Karski able to visit his
homeland. After that, he divided his time between Poland and a home
in Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Karski will be buried at Mount Olive cemetery in Bethesda, Md.
His grave will be next to that of his late wife, actress Pola
Nirenska, who died in 1992, the PAP news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Free Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Tired and sunburned after 83 days'
captivity in the jungle, a Malaysian released Friday by Muslim
rebels said he hoped his fellow hostages would also be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Jawah Salawat, a 38-year-old police corporal, was the
second Malaysian freed by the rebel group Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have said there ''is a very good prospect of
additional hostages being released'' in the coming days,
Philippines government spokesman Ricardo Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in good health,'' Abdul Jawah told The Associated Press in
Zamboanga, where he was taken after his release on the southern
Jolo island. ''I'm happy, but I remember my friends, and I'm hoping
and praying that they will also be released.''
</P>
<P>
   He described his time with the rebels as a ''very interesting
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I admire the Abu Sayyaf because I was treated well,'' he said.
''They never harmed me.''
</P>
<P>
   His release was negotiated by Malaysian officials, who said no
ransom was paid. Instead, the officials promised to persuade the
government to initiate development projects in Sulu province, the
area where the rebels operate. Jolo island, where the hostages are
being held, is part of Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
   Between the hostages seized April 23 at a Malaysian diving
resort and several other groups of captives, Muslim militants are
now holding 39 people in the southern Philippines, including 21
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Salawat's release came as foreign ministers from France, Germany
and Finland were in the Philippines urging President Joseph
Estrada's government not to use violence to try to free the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told reporters he was
thankful for assurances from Estrada that ''there will be a
peaceful, sound, and we hope quick release of all hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja released one hostage's
letter appealing for the captives' release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our mental condition is getting worse every day and it is not
far from one of us committing suicide,'' wrote Risto Vahanen, a
Finn. ''Please do your utmost to get us out of these inhumane
conditions without delay, peacefully without force.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado suspended formal
negotiations with Abu Sayyaf leaders more than a month ago after
the rebels began escalating their demands. He said he was
optimistic Friday after talking twice the previous day by telephone
with Ghalib Andang, an Abu Sayyaf leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two Muslim rebel groups
fighting the Philippine government for a separate Islamic nation in
the south.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted After Slay Plan Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A man who left detailed plans for his wife's
killing on his electronic organizer was convicted of her murder
Friday and sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a carefully planned murder, which is quite apparent
from the evidence on your Psion organizer,'' Judge Jonathan van der
Werff said in sentencing Gary Debruin.
</P>
<P>
   Belinda Debruin's throat was slit and she was stabbed more than
100 times with a screwdriver and knives at the couple's home in a
London suburb. She also suffered a fractured skull in the Dec. 1,
1999, attack.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told the Inner London Crown Court jury that the
35-year-old Debruin, a debt-ridden salesman, killed his wife to
collect insurance on her life and tried to make the attack look
like a robbery gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   He disposed of his bloodstained shirt and the weapons and went
to work as usual -- even telephoning a travel agent to book a
holiday for his wife's birthday a week later.
</P>
<P>
   However, Debruin was caught by blood specks on his shoes and
clothing -- and by an entry made on his Psion organizer a month
before his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rubber glvs, throwt, take tel off hook, leave purse out with
contents spread out, take chq crd and crdt crds, ring mobile just
befor yo leave,'' read the entry, filed under ''Bdb,'' for Belinda
Debruin.
</P>
<P>
   Debruin confessed to the killing but pleaded manslaughter on the
grounds of provocation. He painted his wife as a cruel, domineering
woman with expensive tastes who belittled him until he
''completely, totally and utterly lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury of seven men and five women was more convinced by the
prosecution's depiction of 33-year-old Belinda as a devoted mother
who dressed her children in designer clothes and sent them to
private school.
</P>
<P>
   Financial woes brought on by Debruin's failed printing business
and string of lost jobs put a strain on the marriage, the court was
told.
</P>

   ''He was simply an inadequate individual, who couldn't hold down
a job, ran up debts, blamed everybody else and finally resorted to
murder,'' said police Detective Sergeant Peter Allbut. ''There is
no doubt the motive was purely financial.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Depend on Mobility  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   VEDENO DISTRICT, Russia (AP) -- With eight lean-tos made of
branches and four canvas tents huddled under trees, the makeshift
rebel camp deep in the foothills of Chechnya looks like a last
outpost for a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is flimsy compared with Russian forces' fortified
posts, bunkers and checkpoints, but it also demonstrates one reason
why the rebels remain a formidable opponent after 10 months of war
against a vast and heavily equipped army.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' success in bloodying Russian troops depends on the
speed with which they can swoop into the Russian-controlled
lowlands, launch ambushes and melt away into the forests, where
federal troops are reluctant to pursue them. The rebels' mobility
is their best weapon against the Russians' overwhelming advantage
in air power and heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   They pitch camp for a few days, hidden from air surveillance by
the thick foliage, then move on again.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no sense in building any fortifications because of air
raids, and in any case combat units do not stay in any one place
for long,'' said a rebel named Saib-Magomed. ''But sometimes we use
military bases in the mountains that were built before the war, or
the bases left behind by Russian troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops quickly seized control of Chechnya's lowlands
during the first few months of the war, which started in September.
But the military campaign stalled as most rebel bands took refuge
in the rugged southern mountains, from which they have conducted a
guerrilla war. They vow to keep fighting until the last Russian has
been expelled from the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels carry almost all their ammunition on their backs, in
rucksacks that weigh up to 132 pounds. To cut down on the load,
some forgo sleeping bags, bedding down instead on the forest floor.
And many wear water-resistant camouflage uniforms every day to stay
dry during summer downpours and avoid having to carry a second set
of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''During one of our marches, I had to carry two mortar shells.
My arms became numb, I felt like I couldn't go on anymore, but I
didn't want to admit it,'' said a 20-year-old fighter named Ruslan.
''I had only one wish: to get rid of everything, throw myself on
the ground and die.''
</P>
<P>
   The makeshift camp in the Vedeno district, about 35 miles south
of the capital Grozny, is one of several that dot the southern
foothills. Rebels estimate that about 1,000 of their number are in
this district, and other militant bands are scattered across the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spend all my time in the forests,'' rebel commander Shamil
Basayev said in a televised interview released this week by the
Azerbaijan News Service. ''We have bases all over the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp is an eight-hour walk along mountain paths from the
nearest village. On a recent, scorching afternoon, fighters lounged
in the camp, collecting their strength for the night -- when they
are on the move.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels lead a spartan life, bathing in cool springs and
creeks that meander through the hills. Inside the tents,
machine-guns and grenade-launchers hang off twigs of the wooden
beams that serve as frames. Some of the tents have radios, which
help the rebels monitor the government's information campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's funny to hear Russian reports that federal
troops have found some of our military bases with arms arsenals,''
Saib-Magomed said. ''We certainly have our hiding places, but there
are only a few of them, and none have been discovered yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers cook most of the rebels' food, bringing them boiled
meat, flatbread, potatoes and noodles. When the rebels are on the
march, or surrounded, they eat canned food.
</P>
<P>
   Medicines pose a greater problem, since the fighters have little
more than iodine, ointments and bandages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is practically impossible to care for seriously wounded
fighters. We try to get them to a hospital as soon as possible,''
said a doctor who joined up with the rebels and gave only his first
name, Surkho.
</P>
<P>
   Mumadi Saidayev, a senior rebel field commander, agreed that the
fighters occasionally had problems getting enough medicine. But, he
said, the rebels could always restock their weapons arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian troops help us in this,'' he said. ''The majority
came here to make money, so we'll always have what we need in
exchange for cash.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Ban Ruins India Rural Economy  </HEADLINE>
By HEMA SHUKLA
<TEXT>
<P>
   EKVARI, India (AP) -- The once-grand mansion run to ruin is the
only indication the Bhola Singh family was once prosperous. Today
in the courtyard, tired women in threadbare clothes bake unleavened
bread on wood-burning stoves, and scampering barefoot children swat
at flies.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Bhola Singh's fields lay fallow, left unattended
after militants decreed that lower caste peasants would no longer
plow the fields of upper caste landlords.
</P>
<P>
   The blockade, the militants declared, was to break the
landlords' centuries-old control of the land and their exploitation
of the peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't tilled our land for 11 years. They killed six
members of our family because of the land,'' said Sunaina Devi, who
lives with 18 other Singh family members in Ekvari village in
eastern India, some 525 miles southeast of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,000 people have been slain in a decade of caste
killings in central Bihar, India's poorest and most lawless state.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the human toll, a major casualty of the bloodshed is
agriculture, the state's economic base. In some places, it has
ceased to exist. Families have been forced to sell property and
jewelry to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Although the house of Bhola Singh is huge by rural standards,
with wide verandahs wrapped around two stories and more than a
dozen rooms, its paint is peeling and parts of the walls are
crumbling. There is no money for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Central Bihar, around this village, was once considered India's
''rice bowl,'' but now no more than 5 percent of its rice mills are
functioning, and most of the fields are brown and barren.
</P>
<P>
   Young lower caste men, barred from tilling the fields, must turn
elsewhere for work and abandon their villages, leaving them
vulnerable to retaliation in the caste warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Devi's father-in-law and three other male
relatives were shot dead while supervising plowing in defiance of
the ban. Two years later, two more Singh men were killed while
overseeing installation of a well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have one son, but I have sent him away,'' Devi said. ''If he
remained here he would have been killed or at least jailed in a
fake (legal) case.''
</P>
<P>
   About 83 percent of India's 1 billion people are Hindus,
classified by adherents into four major castes. The government has
been trying to educate members of lower castes and promote equal
rights, and more people are challenging the status of the upper
castes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bihar landowners, members of the Bhumihar community, blame
two outlawed groups for the violence -- the Maoist Communist Center
and the People's War Group.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Maoist Communist Center guerrillas killed 35
Bhumihars in Senari. On June 17, the Bhumihars' private militia,
Ranvir Sena, struck back in Miapur, a nearby village, killing 34
people -- 19 women, seven old men, seven boys and one young girl.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the Maoists vowed to attack four or five
Bhumihar-dominated villages within 30 days, saying ''the toll will
not be less than 150.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranvir Sena's area commander retorted that the militia would
''kill 10 times the number they kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The news created panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fear is always in our hearts. Until our menfolk return in the
evening, we shrivel with anxiety,'' said Lallani Kunwar, whose
husband was among the six Singh men killed.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bhola Singh negotiated with the Maoists and was
allowed to farm seven acres, about 10 percent of his holding, on
condition that he turn over to the guerrillas some 1,400 pounds of
rice per acre farmed. On average, each acre yields about 3,300
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even giving away more than 40 percent of their harvest, the
family's fortunes have improved. They are eating better and can
send their children to school. But they don't have enough for the
dowries of their 11 girls of marriageable age.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we began farming two years ago, we have been able to
marry off two girls. The grooms were understanding and didn't
demand any dowry,'' Devi said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 who remain are aged 15 to 20. In rural India, girls marry
soon after puberty, and women nearing 20 are considered spinsters.
Indian social custom calls for the bride's family to supply a
dowry, and a prosperous family like Singh's would be expected to
provide at least the equivalent of $100,000 for each daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our biggest fight is for the marriage of our daughters,'' said
Kunwar, the widow, who has five daughters. ''Once they are married
off, we will be at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Bhumihar leaders say they are preparing to defend
themselves against the guerrillas' threatened attacks. Bhola Singh
said there are 5,000 armed men in Ekvari.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these men here are soldiers of the (Ranvir) Sena,'' Singh
said, nodding toward a group of men standing behind him. ''We
haven't surrendered our arms. If we do so, we will be killed.''

<HEADLINE> AIDS Conference Focuses on Funds  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- The high-profile International AIDS
Conference, held for the first time at ground zero of the epidemic,
ended Friday as it began, dominated as much by questions of money
and political will as of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 people from around the world came together for
a week to look for solutions to an epidemic that now infects 34
million people on the planet, 95 percent of them in the poorest
regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge is to move from rhetoric to action, and action
at an unprecedented intensity and scale,'' said Nelson Mandela,
South Africa's former president, referring to his country's often
criticized response to the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those at the conference spoke of cutting-edge
research into new drugs, like ones that have changed AIDS into a
manageable disease in wealthy countries, most of the attention was
on the much more basic need to prevent the explosive spread of the
virus in countries with the fewest resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us who came here are putting pressure on the
governments of the world to ante up the money to pay for drug and
prevention programs that are so needed,'' said Canada's Dr. Mark
Wainberg, head of the International AIDS Society, the meeting's
sponsor. ''I hope people won't go back to life as usual. This can't
be the end of it. It has to be the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, head of UNAIDS, said Africa alone needs $3
billion a year -- 10 times what is being spent now -- to offer the
most basic AIDS prevention and care.
</P>
<P>
   In general, experts know how to stop AIDS: Educate people about
how the disease spreads. Promote condom use. Discourage
promiscuity. Control other sexually transmitted diseases. Treat
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the meeting spoke of the need of wealthy governments and
pharmaceutical companies to understand the complexity and urgency
of the epidemic -- to comprehend that AIDS is the worst infectious
disease threat in recorded history, as Dr. Roy M. Anderson of
Oxford University described it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meeting has really underscored the need for global
solidarity on HIV/AIDS,'' said Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, deputy AIDS
chief at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''It
is the first conference in which I have perceived such a compelling
sense of urgency. The heat is on. There is no way to ignore the
catastrophe that is taking place around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   However, another theme of the week was the need for those at
greatest risk to help themselves, for governments in the poorest
countries to acknowledge AIDS' threat to their people and to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''What came out of the conference is a need for African
governments to commit more of the little resources we have to this
fight,'' said Kojo Lokko of the Ghana Social Marketing Foundation.
''We keep talking about how poor African countries are, but we can
do better than we have. It's not enough to say that somebody from
far away should come save us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the ultimate solution to the epidemic is
development of a vaccine. However, no significant breakthroughs in
this area were reported at the meeting, and experts believe an even
modestly effective AIDS vaccine is several years away.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many doubted the AIDS drugs that transformed the
epidemic in the United States and elsewhere could have much impact
in poor countries because of their high price. But now that
thinking is changing. Experts talked of pressuring pharmaceutical
companies to lower their prices and allow cheaper generic versions
of their medicines to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this shift is a belief that widespread availability of
AIDS drugs could substantially slow the epidemic as well as help
those already infected. AIDS drugs lower the amount of virus in
semen and other fluids, and this makes virus carriers much less
likely to infect others.
</P>
<P>
   One area where drugs could make a difference is stopping the
spread of HIV from infected mothers to their babies. Research this
week confirmed that just one dose of the drug nevirapine during
labor can substantially lower transmission, although virus that
spreads after birth through breast-feeding wipes out much of the
benefit. In one notable announcement of the conference,
nevirapine's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, said it will offer the
drug free to infected pregnant women in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The international AIDS meeting will be held next in 2002 in
Barcelona, Spain, and in 2004 in Toronto.

<HEADLINE> US, China Sense Urgency Over Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Sharing a sense of urgency, both the
United States and China want movement soon on reconciling Taiwan
with the mainland. After three days of talks with senior Chinese
officials, however, Defense Secretary William Cohen heard little
more than a softening of tone.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Friday he told Wang Daohan, the Beijing government's
top contact with Taiwan on reunification issues, that ''time is of
the essence,'' and that China should realize that a special
opportunity exists in the early months of the administration of
Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe every opportunity should be taken advantage of to
explore ways in which a reconciliation can be achieved''
peacefully, Cohen told a news conference after his meeting with
Wang.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen flew to Shanghai on Friday after two days of talks with
top Chinese leaders in Beijing, including President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Wang ''indicated that this needs to be resolved'' but
Beijing still insists that Taiwan acknowledge in advance that if
reunification takes place, it will not have the status of a
separate state. China describes its formula for reunifying with
Taiwan as ''one China, two systems,'' meaning the capitalist Taiwan
economy could remain in place but Beijing would be the sovereign
power.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year China said the Taiwan issue needed to be
resolved soon or risked becoming a trigger for war. Senior U.S.
officials traveling with Cohen said they heard no such rhetoric in
their talks this week, although it is clear that Beijing would like
to see progress soon on a peaceful path to reunification.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member of Cohen's delegation, speaking privately, said
Cohen believes the opportunity for a breakthrough could slip away
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the mainland waits six months on this, probably the chances
of moving things forward diminish,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   This and other officials who were present in Cohen's talks said
the Chinese were less bellicose than only a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really impressive if you see the change in tone, a change
in the nature of the discussion,'' said one official, who has been
closely involved in China affairs since before the U.S. erroneously
bombed China's embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia last May, an event
that ruptured relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The discussion is in a sense more relaxed, it's more
constructive, it's more forward-looking, there's not a sense of
total stubbornness and crisis,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after his meeting, Cohen said he found no
surprises in Wang's main message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Wang indicated that this needs to be resolved (and) there
has to be a commitment to the one-China policy on the part of
Taiwan,'' Cohen said. While not offering any specific new ideas,
Cohen said the Chinese government needs to conduct ''some creative
examination'' of options.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said the defense secretary was
satisfied that he had achieved his goal of encouraging officials to
move ahead now on the Taiwan dispute during talks this week in both
Beijing and Shanghai. Bacon said Cohen had not expected any
immediate breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has encouraged all the officials with whom he talked to
seize the moment,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been careful to avoid getting
involved as a mediator in the China-Taiwan dispute, although it has
exhorted both sides to hold face-to-face talks in search of a
peaceful resolution. Washington acknowledges China's claim to
Taiwan, but by law must help the island maintain its defense.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Wang, Cohen addressed the Shanghai Stock Exchange,
which he called the ''epicenter of the burgeoning Chinese economy''
and a future engine of growth for the economies throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He touted the power of free trade and predicted quick approval
by the Senate of permanent normal trade relations with China, which
he said was a key to completing the ''circle of stability,
prosperity and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The wealthier China becomes, the more its people will embrace
democracy and demand change, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Becoming a full partner in the world economic system will lead
to inevitable change in China,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Jerusalem Plans  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some of the proposed plans for Jerusalem, beginning
with each
side's declared positions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli position:
</P>
<P>
   Keep Jerusalem exclusively under Israeli sovereignty, keeping
status quo of freedom of access to holy sites, and with open
borders to a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian position:
</P>
<P>
   Divide the city into two capitals, the Palestinians in the east
and the Israelis in the west, with no physical division demarcating
the border. There would be separate municipalities but an umbrella
body would coordinate issues affecting both capitals. In the
ultrasensitive Old City, Israel would retain sovereignty only in
the Jewish quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives:
</P>
<P>
   --Beilin/Abbas plan: negotiated in informal talks in 1995 between
Yossi Beilin, now Israel's justice minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, a
top aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. This would expand the
borders of the city to include West Bank suburbs, where the
Palestinians would base their capital. Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has rejected the plan, insisting on sovereignty within the
current municipal borders.
</P>
<P>
   --Boroughs: This would allow the Palestinians partial
administrative control in Arab neighborhoods, including health,
education and utilities. In the Old City, holy sites including the
Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher would be
managed by the Palestinians while overall sovereignty would be
retained by Israel. The plan, put together by Israeli doves and
city planners, is reportedly on the table at Camp David.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem a Pivotal Issue in Mideast  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestine Hamdallah and her family live wedged
into the dust-swept corner of a construction site where a soaring
testament to the triumphant Jewish return to Jerusalem is planned.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old mother of three has turned down substantial
offers from representatives of American Jewish millionaire Irwin
Moscowitz to hand over her small white house in the Ras al-Amud
neighborhood to his latest project, a 132-apartment complex with a
view of Jerusalem's walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdallah's objection is simple: once she moves out, she would
never be welcome in the new complex -- because she is an Arab.
Moscowitz has made a career of buying land in traditionally Arab
neighborhoods to reinforce the Jewish majority in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband says he was born here and we have no other place to
go, so we are staying,'' Hamdallah said in her living room,
speaking over the racket of drills and jackhammers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The baby can't even sleep,'' she added, referring to the
8-month-old son at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdallah's confrontation with Moscowitz goes to the heart of
one of the toughest issues facing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David: who controls
Jerusalem and its highly charged symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians seek Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of the
state they hope to declare this year. Israel insists that the parts
of the city it captured in the 1967 Mideast war will remain united
under its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such seemingly intractable positions, academics, clerics
and others have come up with ideas they say could accommodate both
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has armed himself at the talks with one such report by an
Israeli think tank, the Jerusalem Institute. It divides Jerusalem
into boroughs that would allow limited sovereignty in Palestinian
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister and a close Barak
adviser, says that areas where Israel would be willing to cede some
control include water, electricity, education and health.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media have also reported that Barak is ready to hand
over some neighborhoods to total Palestinian control -- in exchange
for Israeli control of West Bank Jewish settlements now functioning
as suburbs of the city. According to the most recent figures, the
city, at the end of 1998, had 433,600 Jewish and 196,100 Arab
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of dividing Jerusalem into boroughs -- in the Jerusalem
Institute plan, 12 Israeli boroughs and four Palestinian -- dates to
the 1970s, although it has never officially been proposed by any
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   What is new about the Jerusalem Institute's plan -- and the
apparent interest in it by Barak, who carried a copy in his
briefcase to Camp David -- is that it cedes some Israeli powers in
the walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Holy sites such as the al-Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest site in
Islam, and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where Jesus is
believed to have been crucified, would be managed by the
Palestinians. But overall sovereignty would be retained by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Olmert, Jerusalem's mayor, dismisses such notions as
''Italian pasta. Everything would be mixed up with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmert has endorsed Moscowitz's footholds in Arab neighborhoods,
which the Palestinians have decried as provocative attempts to
diminish their stake in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners say any handover that endangers Jewish sovereignty
at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, would negate the
triumph of the 1967 war, when Israel's victory ended two decades of
Arab refusal to allow any access to Jewish holy cites in the Old
City.
</P>
<P>
   That is the logic behind efforts by Olmert and Moscowitz to
build a wall of Jewish neighborhoods around the Old City by buying
land -- often through third parties -- from Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts, Palestinians say, disrupt the contiguity of Arab
neighborhoods and could prejudice the outcome of talks on the
city's final status.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerusalem is the core of peace, the sake for which we have
spilled so much blood,'' said Faisel Husseini, the top PLO official
in the city. ''Without Jerusalem there is no peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Such declarations by both sides inhibit creative solutions, says
Ora Achimeir, director of the Jerusalem Institute. By removing what
she calls the ''nonstarter'' issue of sovereignty from discussion,
the sides can be more flexible in coming up with solutions,
including what she describes as ''functional sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli leaders -- most notably Haim Ramon, the Cabinet
minister in charge of Jerusalem -- say such solutions miss the
point: Jerusalem's fate cannot be resolved now and should be left
for later.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, an architect of the breakthrough 1993 Oslo accords
and now Barak's justice minister, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   His informal talks with Mahmoud Abbas, a top Arafat aide, a few
years ago resulted in a plan to extend the municipal boundaries to
West Bank suburbs, allowing the Palestinians to declare a capital
in new areas of Jerusalem while the Israelis maintain control of
much of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Beilin says, is not to be swept up in emotional
questions of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   For Hamdallah, whose home and patch of olives trees are
virtually lost in the bustle of construction, the solution is
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right in two -- half for the Israelis, half for the
Palestinians,'' she said, slapping her right hand down the middle
of her left palm.

<HEADLINE> Former Cat Stevens Denies Hamas Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Yusuf Islam -- formerly known as pop star Cat
Stevens -- criticized Israeli authorities on Friday for deporting
him and denied that he had ever knowingly supported Islamic
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, 51, who changed his name after becoming a Muslim in the
late 1970s, was refused entry into Israel hours after arriving
Wednesday. The former singer said he was told only that he was a
''threat to national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Defense Ministry officials refused to comment on Islam's
case other than to say that the Shin Bet, Israel's internal
intelligence agency, had ordered him barred from the country. The
Maariv Daily in Israel reported that the government claimed Islam
had delivered tens of thousands of dollars to Hamas, a militant
Islamic group, during his last visit in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''Upon my return to London, reports were already circulating
that the Israeli authorities were trying to excuse their actions by
linking me to terrorist groups,'' Islam said in a statement. ''I
want to make sure that people are aware that I've never knowingly
supported any terrorist groups -- past, present or future. It's
simply an attempt to cast doubt again on my character and good
intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Islam -- who as Cat Stevens who wrote such songs as ''Peace
Train'' and ''Wild World'' -- said that he is presently supporting
orphans in Hebron, and all his donations in the past have been
given to humanitarian causes.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says that money designated for Hamas-backed charities
often is diverted to the militant Islamic movement's guerrilla
wing. Hebron is a Hamas stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   The former singer said that he arrived in Israel on Wednesday
with a film crew from VH1, traveling with him as part of a
television special on his spiritual discovery, called ''Behind the
Music.'' The crew had traveled with Islam to Bosnia, and were
headed to Israel via Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, Islam said he was separated from the crew and
detained by airport authorities when his name appeared on a list of
people banned from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Islam had previously been barred from entering Israel in 1990,
when he tried to get in along with his 8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The former singer, who was born Stephen Georgiou, took Cat
Stevens as a stage name and had a string of hits in the early
1970s. He abandoned his music career in 1978 and changed his name
after converting to Islam. He initially believed his former
lifestyle was forbidden by Islamic law, but has since started
writing songs again.
</P>
<P>
   He later began teaching and actively spreading the word of his
religion, founding a Muslim school in 1983.

Play Looks at German Jews After WWII   
An AP Entertainment Review
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Playwright Amos Kamil focuses on an intriguing
place and time, Germany one year after World War II, in his new
play, ''The Flame Keepers,'' now running at the off-Broadway 47th
Street Theater. But his execution is less clear than his
conception.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Flame Keeper'' is set in a Berlin cigar shop. Dr. Julius
Reiter, played by Lenny Mandel, comes to the shop every morning,
specifically to harass the owner, Ernst Gruber, played by Paul
Whelihan. The word flame is used each time Reiter asks Gruber to
light his cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter, a Jewish professor, had fled Germany, fearing
persecution by the Nazis, and now has returned. He taunts Gruber.
Did Gruber know the previous owner of the cigar shop, or the
florist whose shop was nearby? Both were Jewish and now they're
gone. Reiter also announces his plans to go to Palestine to help
build a Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the no-intermission play, there is a dramatic
turnaround. Up to that point, it's assumed that Gruber is a
non-Jewish German, in effect part of the apparatus of oppression.
Suddenly it becomes clear that he is Jewish, and endured the war
here in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the men argue about whether Jews should have tried
to survive by leaving Germany or staying. And they argue, with a
barrage of quotes from philosophers, whether Jews need to be
religious.
</P>
<P>
   The acting by Mandel and Whelihan is fine. But the writing moves
in jerks, and some points that should be incisive instead come
across as muddled.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Goforth directed, and Kenneth Foy created a cozy,
realistic-looking cigar shop.

<HEADLINE> US Military Ships Collide Off Oahu  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Two U.S. military ships collided in the Pacific,
causing significant structural damage to the vessels but no
injuries, the Navy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Denver and USNS Yukon continued to operate on their own
power after Thursday night's accident 180 miles west of Oahu, the
Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver, an amphibious transport dock ship based in San
Diego, was scheduled to arrive at Pearl Harbor later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yukon, an oiler that is part of the military Sea Lift
Command and includes civilians among its crew, was expected to
arrive back at its base in Pearl Harbor this weekend, said Lt.
Cmdr. Conrad Chun, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know how many people were aboard each ship at the time
but said the Denver normally carries 380 and the Yukon 100.
</P>
<P>
   The collision is under investigation, the Navy said.

<HEADLINE> Safety Testimony at Lockerbie Trial  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- An airport official admitted
Friday that airliners leaving Malta may have routinely carried bags
whose owners were unknown, reinforcing prosecutors' contention that
the suitcase bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 came from an Air
Malta jet.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans charged with the murder of 259 people on board
the Pan Am airliner and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie,
Scotland, worked in the Libyan Arab Airlines offices on the
Mediterranean island of Malta.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim that on the morning of the Dec. 21, 1988,
explosion, the defendants planted an unaccompanied suitcase with
the bomb on Air Malta Flight KM 180 to Frankfurt, Germany. They say
the suitcase was transferred there onto a feeder flight connecting
with New York-bound Flight 103 at Heathrow airport in London.
</P>
<P>
   Wilfred Borg, general manager for ground operations, appeared
testy and defensive as the Scottish prosecutor Alan Turnbull
pressed him on baggage security procedures at Malta's Luqa Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the procedures as ''flexible,'' Turnbull presented
the court with Air Malta records from 1988 and 1989 and singled out
a number of flights that showed discrepancies between the number of
bags checked and those counted by loading supervisors on the
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Turnbull pointed to a Dec. 21, 1988, Air Malta
flight to Cairo in which five bags left on the tarmac in a previous
flight were cleared without any apparent record of their
identification by passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the obvious inference not that baggage was on board without
passengers?'' asked Turnbull.
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' said Borg.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must have at least have been a possibility,'' insisted
Turnbull.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot discount the possibility,'' the witness answered.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbull said 55 bags were checked and recorded as loaded onto
KM 180 to Frankfurt, but noted that although the flight coupons
belonging to a group of three passengers showed 16 bags, the
check-in list registered only 14 bags.
</P>
<P>
   Borg rejected the prosecutor's suggestion that a decline in the
average number of inconsistencies after February 1989 suggests
security lapses were cleaned up after German police came to Malta
to question airport employees in connection with the Lockerbie
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Turnbull asked Borg to verify a photo
badge that gave defendant Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, the Libyan
airline's station manager, security clearance throughout the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   This was after the prosecutor had asked whether a person
familiar with security operations and access to loading areas could
''deliberately have circumvented the checks you had in place?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything is possible,'' said Borg. ''Whether it was probable
is a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began May 3, is being held at a former U.S. air
force base before a Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
   Fhimah and co-defendant Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi deny any
role in the terrorist bombing, accusing Palestinian groups of
responsibility. Prosecutors say the two men were Libyan
intelligence agents.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Storms Mass Wedding in Jordan  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A Palestinian tribesman stormed into an
outdoor mass wedding party Friday and opened fire, killing a member
of a rival tribe and wounding another guest before he was shot and
killed by police, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, identified as Khalid al-Ghizawi, was seeking revenge
against Saeed Harazeen, a guest at the wedding, police said. He
opened fire as 70 Muslim couples were celebrating their marriages,
causing panic among the crowd of over 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Ghizawi was retaliating for the recent killing of a relative
by Harazeen's tribe, a police official told The Associated Press.
Both men belong to Palestinian families from the Gaza Strip and now
live in Jordan's Gaza refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Harazeen died on the way to the hospital of five gunshot wounds
in and around the heart, officials at the Islamic Hospital said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The second wounded man, Mustafa Hamad, 59, was in good condition
at the Islamic Hospital, where officials said he had a slight wound
in the left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Although tribal revenge is a crime under civil law, the
phenomenon is widespread in the Arab world, especially among the
once-nomadic Bedouin tribes who roamed the Arabian desert until
they were settled in different countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses said the gunman stormed into the wedding party at a
football courtyard at Al-Itihad High School in Amman's upscale
Sports City district.
</P>
<P>
   One eyewitness said he saw the gunman walking toward Harazeen,
who was chatting with friends. He said the gunman took out his
weapon and shot Harazeen several times before police, on hand
because of the large gathering, fired back.
</P>
<P>
   The party was canceled, and the brides and grooms were swiftly
escorted out.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 24; Nasdaq Climbs 47  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday following the release of new
government data that showed inflationary pressures remain under
control.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 24.75 at 10,813.46.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 47.15 at 4,222.01 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 8.01 at 1,503.85.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of next week, when
many companies will report their second-quarter earnings. The
market on Friday focused mainly on three new reports that provided
more evidence of a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers,
rose 0.6 percent in June. While that gain was bigger than expected,
it mostly was due to a sharp rise in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which
doesn't include energy or food costs, fell an unexpected 0.1
percent in June, the best showing since January.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, retail sales rose by a slightly
bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent in June, but excluding the
volatile automobile category, sales rose just 0.2 percent, weaker
than expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a third report, industrial production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose an expected 0.2 percent in
June, the slowest pace since September.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports showed that the Federal Reserve's six
interest-rate hikes over the past year were cooling off the
economy's pace and keeping inflation under control. That helped
ease investors' fears that the Fed will raise rates again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earnings are fine, inflation is fine, the world is in good
shape, but people are still a little nervous about the stock
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''We had a very tough spring
and that forced many people to be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive economic news helped push banking and financial
stocks higher. J.P. Morgan, which reported strong earnings on
Thursday, gained $5.563 to $129.688, while Citigroup rose $1.188 to
$67.813.
</P>
<P>
   Merck came under some selling pressure, falling $1.813 to $67.25
after a federal advisory panel told the Food and Drug
Administration that the company's Mevacor is a safe and effective
treatment to reduce high cholesterol, but it shouldn't be sold
without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which were up sharply in early trading, gave
back some gains by early afternoon. Semiconductor shares were
mixed, with Altera Corp. gaining $9.125 to $120.188 after reporting
better-than-expected earnings, while PMC-Sierra dropped $7.5 to
$221.438.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 639.81 million
shares, down from 692.06 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.76 at 541.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Victims More Than Those Who Die  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- The 4-month-old gurgling and smiling
baby boy was so unwanted by his HIV-infected mother she could not
wait for his birth to get rid of him. She demanded a Caesarean
section and then abandoned the infant to the only place that would
have him, a home run by missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not one person wants to take an HIV baby,'' said Colin
Pratley, who runs the Shepherd's Keep home for abandoned babies.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned babies, orphaned children, elderly women forced to
raise the children of their deceased children -- as AIDS sweeps
Africa, it is not just those who die that are its victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''AIDS is clearly a disaster,'' former President Nelson Mandela
said Friday in the closing speech to delegates at the 13th
International AIDS Conference in the coastal city of Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy in African countries worst hit by the pandemic
is expected to fall to around 30 within a decade, according to a
study released at the conference by the U.S. Census Bureau. In
Botswana, the report predicted life expectancy would drop to 29 in
10 years because of AIDS. Without the epidemic, it would be 71.
</P>
<P>
   With most of those dying from AIDS between the ages of 25 and
45, ''there is a whole generation that is going to disappear,''
said Peter Piot, the United Nations' top AIDS official.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the people who are the breadwinners, they are
developing the country, they are the ones the country has invested
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When they disappear, a dwindling number of elderly are left to
care for a flood of parentless children, Piot said
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally when you are 60 and 70, you have the right to a good
old age where you are taken care of by your children. It's not
normal ... that they have to take care of their (ill) children, of
their grandchildren and be the breadwinners,'' Piot said. ''That
means an enormous destabilization.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, nearly 28 million African children will have lost at
least one parent to the disease, according to a report by the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   In six African countries, nearly one-third of children under 15
will have lost at least one parent by then, mostly because of AIDS,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In Zambia, 65 percent of households where the mother had died
dissolved, forcing the children to live with impoverished elderly
relatives, one study presented at the conference said. Many of
those orphans were malnourished and had to drop out of school,
increasing the risk that they would never break out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   With so many orphans and abandoned children, many African
countries will find themselves contending with a generation of
angry, unwanted and uneducated children.
</P>
<P>
   ''These countries are at severe risk. Their governments may fail
and future generations will not be there,'' said Carol Bellamy,
executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since Pratley, 54, and his wife, Cheryl, opened
their home for abandoned babies, they have cared for 127 infants,
97 percent of them HIV positive, Pratley said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the abandonments, such as a month-old girl brought in
Thursday after being left in an apartment building, are tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as the baby shoved into a plastic bag and thrown
onto a busy highway, are horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   The Pratleys keep these children until they are six months old
and then look for families to adopt them. Since the HIV that many
were born with disappears after a few months, many find homes,
Pratley said.
</P>
<P>
   This is because it can take months to determine whether a baby
will remain HIV positive. At birth, many babies still have residual
cells from their mothers that carry the virus. However, as those
cells disappear, the virus also disappears from many infants.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shepherd's Keep nursery, 14 babies sleep quietly in cribs
lining the walls of a living room and two bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Their tiny fists used to clench as they slept, Pratley said.
Now, with the love and care of nursery staff, their hands have
slowly opened, a sign the severe trauma they have suffered was
seeping out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be abandoned at birth, there is nothing worse than that,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Minister challenges Bush: 'Missed opportunity' on death penalty  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A religious leader forcefully challenged
George W. Bush on Friday for allowing an execution in Texas, saying
the governor ''missed an opportunity to show some of this
compassion'' he talks about in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about Gary Graham's guilt ''gave you a way to show some
compassion and love in a way that had not been shown before,'' the
Rev. Joseph Garlic told the presumptive GOP presidential nominee as
the two men sat at close quarters during a discussion at a
community center in an inner-city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''You and I must differ on the death penalty,'' Bush quickly
replied. Fairly enforced, he said, it saves lives. ''My job is to
uphold the laws of my state and that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a political decision for me,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   But Garlic persisted, ''While you may say to me it was not a
political decision, it was not a moral decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was polite but pointed as the community leader
pressed Bush to explain why he had permitted the execution of a
black man whose conviction largely hinged on the testimony of a
single eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   When Garlic said he was not satisfied with Bush's initial
answer, the Texas governor said, ''Well, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Garlic said the issue wasn't whether he favored the death
penalty or not but whether ''beyond a reasonable doubt the man was
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reply was similar to his first one: ''We just disagree on
that case.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's fate also figured in a later Bush appearance at a New
York Conservative Party lunch in New York, where he campaigned with
Senate candidate Rick Lazio, who is running against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A few protesters interrupted Bush's remarks by standing and
shouting, ''Stop the racist death penalty. Stop the racist
executions.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has put more people to death than any other state, and
opponents argue that flaws in its justice system allow innocent
people to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he feels certain no innocent Texas inmates have
been executed during his governorship.
</P>
<P>
   He did not have the authority to stop Graham's execution last
month since the inmate had received his one-time, 30-day
gubernatorial reprieve from Bush's predecessor, Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did appoint members of the Board of Pardons and Paroles
that rejected Graham's request for a reprieve, and the governor
said just before the execution, ''After considering all the facts,
I'm confident justice is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   His stop in Elizabeth was in a low-income area across the street
from a building with bars on the first-story windows. Upstairs in
the community center, Bush called for a $400 million increase in
federal aid for after-school programs, with the money to be made
available to low-income parents. He also said institutions such as
churches and synagogues should be eligible to receive federal
funding for such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government shouldn't fear faith and love,'' he
said. ''We should welcome faith and love'' in helping children.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has campaigned for over a year as a
''compassionate conservative,'' and he often says he wants the
''American dream to touch every willing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke earlier in the week at the NAACP convention in
Baltimore. ''My point to the NAACP is sometimes people hear the
word 'Republican' and say he doesn't care. Particularly a white guy
Republican, he really doesn't care,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He told his audience in Elizabeth he hoped his stop at the civil
rights group's convention would prompt people to say ''this guy may
be a little different cut from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated around a table where he and several local leaders
discussed social programs run at the community center, Bush also
said, ''I don't know how many Republican candidates have come to
this neighborhood before.''

By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNAGOV, Romania (AP) -- Harangued by European officials for its
poor treatment of orphans and abandoned children, Romania on Friday
promised to streamline its communist-era system and ensure that
money reaches needy youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the World Bank and the European Union met
with Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu on Friday to discuss the
problem, and urged rapid change.
</P>
<P>
   When communism was overthrown in Romania in 1989, footage of
children living in dismal conditions in state orphanages prompted
foreign families to adopt thousands of Romanian children.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has told Romania to reform its child welfare
system, paying particular attention to the 110,000 to 150,000
children who are abandoned and living in state institutions.
Romania is seeking to join the EU by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money doesn't always get to the children. It gets lost in
bureaucratic circles,'' said Romanian Foreign Minister Petre Roman.
''We must reduce child abandonment and do all we can to show that
abandonment is immoral and a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing poverty -- the average monthly salary is $94 -- and
lingering communist mentalities that encouraged the
institutionalization of impoverished or sick children, have kept
state orphanages full.
</P>
<P>
   The EU, the World Bank and the Romanian government are working
to keep children in families by encouraging foster care and income
supplements to needy families. If Romania follows the strategy to
get government money to children, it will be eligible for
international loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge the rapid implementation of these steps and rapid
reform ... much is yet to be done,'' World Bank representative Ziad
Alahdad told reporters after three hours of discussions at the
lakeside resort of Snagov, 25 miles north of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Isarescu, who has personally devoted himself in
recent months to heading Romania's campaign to improve child
welfare, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a simplified, transparent and efficient system,'' he
said, acknowledging that in the past, when government money was
tight, food to children was among the first things reduced.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Hits 200 in Nigeria Blast  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADEJE, Nigeria (AP) -- The confirmed death toll from a fiery
explosion at a gasoline pipeline in the Niger Delta jumped to 200
on Friday, pushed up by the discovery of more bodies and the deaths
of badly burned villagers.
</P>
<P>
   And the death toll could rise higher still: Many of the injured
-- including those with serious burns -- are in hiding, fearful of
arrest in connection with Monday's blast. Some bodies were hastily
disposed of by villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Ministry of Health official Chris Oghene Chovwen said at least
200 people were confirmed killed. Okpe municipal government
chairman Fullman Akpere said about 180 were killed on the spot and
20 others died later of their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline near the villages of Adeje and Oviri-Court had been
vandalized before it caught fire. Most of the victims were
impoverished villagers, including many children, who were scooping
up gasoline from the pipe when it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline sabotage is common in Nigeria, and the penalty in the
past has ranged from prosecution to being shot on sight by police.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian Red Cross workers drove village-to-village Friday to
try to convince injured people to seek medical care, but most were
nowhere to be seen. Some were apparently being treated by
traditional doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are afraid of being arrested. And they would prefer to
die with their fear,'' Red Cross official Attah Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   A single injured man with oozing burns on his arms, legs and
face turned up at a mobile station set up by the Red Cross team in
Adeje. Thirty or 40 others were believed to be in hiding not far
away. At least two injured people apparently died after refusing
appeals to get treatment in nearby Mereje, said Dr. Vincent Oziga,
a physician there.
</P>
<P>
   The burned man in Adeje, 25-year-old Sunday Tumewo, said he had
been too frightened to go to a nearby hospital and instead treated
his burns himself for several days using a simple antiseptic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was afraid,'' Tumewo said without elaborating. ''I don't
want to think about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Niger state Gov. James Ibori on Thursday urged the injured to go
to doctors and promising they would not be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet hospitals were largely empty, and villagers deserted nearby
communities after the fire, fearing a police crackdown. By Friday
many had begun returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly parents of 23-year-old injured Michael Ebiaghere
decided to take their son to a local hospital Friday after
realizing his life may be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took him this morning because we couldn't handle it,'' his
mother said. Her voice was weak and her eyes stared in a fixed
gaze. She declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   The true death toll from the blast may never be known. Witnesses
saw at least 100 corpses the day afterward. Some local reporters
have estimated that as many as 250 people were killed and many of
the bodies were hastily buried in shallow graves by fearful
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the fire ignited by the explosion still smoldered
despite intermittent rainfall. The water turned the area into a
blackened swamp filled with the overpowering stench of gasoline and
rotting flesh. At least 15 decaying corpses still lay in the field
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy closely resembled an accident in nearby Jesse, where
more than 700 people were killed in 1998. Since then, the
government has tried to educate villagers about the danger of
''scooping,'' the illegal practice of scavenging fuel from
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the pipeline here had been sabotaged seven times
since January, state oil officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Akpere, the municipal official, said scavenging fuel is the only
way for many villagers to make a living. He claimed land, rivers
and swamps in the area were badly damaged by the oil industry,
hindering farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't fish because the water is polluted. They can't farm
because the land has been destroyed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, accounting
for about one-twelfth of oil imported by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 23; Nasdaq Climbs 73  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday following the release of new
government data that showed inflationary pressures remain under
control.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 23.69 at 10,812.40.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 73.28 at 4,248.14 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 13.39 at 1,509.23.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of next week, when
many companies will report their second-quarter earnings. The
market on Friday focused mainly on three new reports that provided
more evidence of a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers,
rose 0.6 percent in June. While that gain was bigger than expected,
it mostly was due to a sharp rise in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which
doesn't include energy or food costs, fell an unexpected 0.1
percent in June, the best showing since January.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, retail sales rose by a slightly
bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent in June, but excluding the
volatile automobile category, sales rose just 0.2 percent, weaker
than expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a third report, industrial production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose an expected 0.2 percent in
June, the slowest pace since September.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports showed that the Federal Reserve's six
interest-rate hikes over the past year were cooling off the
economy's pace and keeping inflation under control. That helped
ease investors' fears that the Fed will raise rates again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earnings are fine, inflation is fine, the world is in good
shape, but people are still a little nervous about the stock
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''We had a very tough spring
and that forced many people to be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive economic news helped push banking and financial
stocks higher. J.P. Morgan, which reported strong earnings on
Thursday, gained $5.513 to $129.438, while Citigroup rose $1.313 to
$67.938.
</P>
<P>
   Merck came under some selling pressure, falling $1.688 to
$67.375 after a federal advisory panel told the Food and Drug
Administration that the company's Mevacor is a safe and effective
treatment to reduce high cholesterol, but it shouldn't be sold
without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which were up sharply in early trading, gave
back some gains by early afternoon. Semiconductor shares were
mixed, with Altera Corp. gaining $9.312 to $120.375 after reporting
better-than-expected earnings, while PMC-Sierra dropped $7.063 to
$221.875.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 744.65 million
shares, down from 825.72 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.83 at 541.93.

<HEADLINE> Agency makes tract historic area, allows work on historic attractions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAY BROOK, N.Y. (AP) - The state's regulator of the Adirondack
Park has reclassified a tract to allow for renovation of one of the
last of the Great Camps while laying the foundation for work on two
more historic attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack Park Agency's approval on Friday was needed for a
$750,000 planned renovation to go forward. That project will allow
repair and maintenance of the Santanoni Great Camp in Newcomb, a
site once visited by Theodore Roosevelt and other historic figures.
</P>
<P>
   The agency voted unanimously to reclassify the Santanoni Great
Camp from wild forest to a historic area, a spokeswoman said
Friday. It now goes to Gov. George Pataki for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   The park agency regulates development in the six-million acre
park of public and private land to maintain its wild character and
protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is fair to say it is an historic day,'' committee
Co-chairman William Kissel said Thursday after a key committee of
the agency approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an important and historic day,'' said state
representative on the committee Richard Hoffman. ''I think the
restoration of Santanoni is a good example of ... sustainable
(environmentally sound) development,'' Hoffman told the Plattsburgh
Press-Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The reclassification allows for the maintenance of buildings
spread across 32 acres: a gatehouse complex, farm complex and main
house. The 102-year-old camp is on the state list of historic sites
and was recently placed in the federal Register of Historic Places
in its entirety. It sits amid nearly 13,000 acres of wild forest on
the edge of the High Peaks Region.
</P>
<P>
   The state will create a tourist attraction of the land that's on
the National Register of Historic Places while protecting the wild
forest that surrounds the camp, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are connected by a 5-mile carriage road that would
be off-limits to motor vehicles, snowmobiles and horses. The plan
would allow some motorized access for maintenance and emergency
vehicles and for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   The only substantive change in the land will be the provision of
extra parking at the gatehouse complex.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the plan discussed here is to make sure this
just remains a camp in the woods,'' APA Counsel Charles Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kirschenbaum, founder of the Adirondack Architectural
Heritage group, said rehabilitation of two other historic sites
could now happen. One is a Revolutionary War battlefield in Crown
Point and the other at John Brown's farm in Lake Placid.

<HEADLINE> Reps. Give Turn From Party Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Their fates sealed by landslide losses in
their party primaries, Reps. Merrill Cook and Matthew ''Marty''
Martinez are spending their final months in office giving their
parties a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, a Utah Republican, and Martinez, a California Democrat,
blame a lack of support from their respective party leaders for
their defeats and have vowed to ignore those leaders during their
final months in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last few weeks (before last month's primary), I told
them repeatedly that a few tens of thousands more dollars would
have turned this into a victory for me,'' said Cook, who has told
GOP leaders not to bother lobbying him on bills.
</P>
<P>
   Cook lost the June 27 GOP primary by 59 percent to 41 percent
after his opponent, computer entrepreneur Derek Smith, pointed to
news reports about Cook's erratic behavior and financial troubles.
Cook, who ran as an independent for governor and congress before
winning his seat as a Republican, also alienated GOP leaders
including fellow Utah Rep. Chris Cannon, who backed Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lost by 63 percent to 28 percent in a March 7 primary
to state Sen. Hilda Solis. She called the nine-term congressman out
of touch with his district and criticized Martinez for his
opposition to gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After he lost, Martinez began voting more often with Republicans
on issues such as the GOP Medicare prescription drug plan,
eliminating inheritance taxes and giving married couples a tax
break.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic leadership made me a free agent when they
turned their back on me,'' Martinez told the Pasadena (Calif.)
Star-News. ''Now I can keep voting according to my beliefs and not
worry about what the leadership thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook hasn't gone as far as Martinez and insists his voting
patterns will not change during his last months in office. He voted
with Republicans on major legislation this week, including the tax
cut for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook has told GOP leaders to lay off the ''whip checks,''
the calls from Majority Whip Tom DeLay's office asking how
lawmakers plan to vote on bills and trying to persuade them to toe
the party line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't want them to be aggressively whipping me on votes
because I've always taken a lot of time to understand the issues,
and they've never really succeeded in moving me from one position
to the other,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, R-Texas, who helped raise money for Cook's campaign, does
not plan to back off, however, spokeswoman Emily Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as he's a member of the Republican caucus, he'll be
whipped on important votes, and we hope he will vote with us on
important legislation,'' Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers-Camden establishes Center for Children and Childhood Studies </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Rutgers University in Camden is establishing
a new center focusing on the study of children, including their
views of God, the effect of having a parent in jail and whether
they're receiving proper health care.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which was approved by the Board of Governors in
March and is just getting underway, brings together faculty, staff
and students involved in the study of and services for children.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members at the Center for Children and Childhood Studies
have already begun research, and classes will be offered in the
fall for students who eventually will work with children in various
fields, said center director Myra Bluebond-Langner.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the goals of the center is to bring together, not only
scholars and policy makers and those responsible for ministering to
children's needs, but also to develop service and outreach programs
and effective graduate and undergraduate education that prepares
students who will be involved in the lives of children - teachers,
social workers, child life specialists, nurses and physicians,''
she said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new area,'' she said. ''I see children and childhood as
being to the next century what women's studies were to the last
century. They're our most valuable resource, and it's a resource I
feel we're not handling responsibly, and it's a resource we can't
afford to squander.''
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members are researching various topics, including
adoption in the former Soviet Union, children's views of God, the
development of social relationships among children, and the ethics
of using children as research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   They also are studying how having a jailed parent affects
children, and the history of fetal alcohol syndrome,
Bluebond-Langner said.
</P>
<P>
   She is not aware of any other similar childhood study centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not to say there aren't any, but they're small in
number. We're not only interested in research and scholarship, but
also development of effective service and outreach programs, policy
work and education in this area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of grants from the Johnson &AMP; Johnson Foundation,
the Knight Foundation and the Campbell Soup Foundation, the center
is undertaking several outreach projects.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Camden Campaign for Children's Literacy, which is
designed to promote reading for children newborn to 5. The
long-term goal is to increase the city's literacy rate.
</P>
<P>
   One facet of the project will be the Reach Out and Read program.
When a child visits a doctor for a checkup, the doctor will give
the parent and child a book. The goal is to have the parent read to
the child.
</P>
<P>
   ''The physician is reinforcing the importance of reading,''
Bluebond-Langner said.
</P>
<P>
   Student volunteers will read to the children in the waiting
rooms as an example to the parents, Bluebond-Langner said. At the
same time, faculty members will monitor the program's
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will also study the effects of enrolling in New
Jersey KidCare, a state-approved program that offers free or
low-cost health insurance coverage for children. They'll study
whether the children's treatment improved with health coverage,
whether parents take their children to the doctor more often, and
whether they are better immunized against diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take the perspective of the need to immerse ourselves in
the multifaceted experiences of children and how they understand
their experience,'' Bluebond-Langner said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Fire Creates Nightmares  </HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- Wilson Begamanya has had nightmares since
his 70-year-old father was called to pray and ended up in an
inferno set by leaders of the Restoration of the Ten Commandments
of God.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been going through dreams of death since that day. My
father and I lived alone. The cult leader sent someone to fetch him
for prayers. I was also invited, but I refused. Moments later, I
heard a terrible blast and then saw flames,'' the brickmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   His mud and wattle house stands alone, separated by a gully from
the cult's former compound and makeshift church in this village 217
miles from the capital, Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father's remains are among the ashes buried in the mass
grave there,'' the 35-year-old Begamanya said, pointing to a mound
of earth where a bulldozer interred what police say were the
remains of 330 victims of the March 17 fire in Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   Spikes of grass protrude from the 15 wood and stone buildings
inside the deserted compound founded by the cult leaders when they
broke with the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The windows and doors of the hall where the faithful perished
had been nailed shut. Today, lizards scramble over the jumble of
twisted, rusting corrugated iron roofing sheets that collapsed
inward.
</P>
<P>
   In Kampala, police spokesman Assuman Mugenyi said this week the
number of deaths linked to the cult had been revised downward to
778 from 978 because 330 people -- not 530 as had been reported --
died in Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 448 other victims were found buried in cellars or
in the yards of compounds belonging to or rented by cult leaders in
other villages and outside Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   Mugenyi said police could not exhume all the bodies and have
suspended their search. But he said pathologists were still
examining victims' remains.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found traces of gasoline in the ruins of the
Kanungu chapel and believe the loud noise people heard was from
containers of gasoline catching fire.
</P>
<P>
   And Mugenyi said police believe cult leader Joseph Kibwetere
might have been murdered by two of his deputies, Dominic Kataribabo
and Credonia Mwerinda, who are believed to be on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''He might have been murdered by Mwerinde and Kataribaabo before
the fire. We cannot tell the exact reason, but there might have
been some disagreement,'' Mugenyi said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the state prosecutor requested an extension to Aug.
14 of the arrest warrant for Kibwetere and six other cult leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The cult members, who had sold all their belongings in hopes of
salvation and in the belief the world would end Dec. 31, 1999, were
allowed to communicate only in signs, had one meal a day, worked
like slaves on the cult's farm, could not have sexual relations and
prayed constantly, according to former members.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I hear any kind of bang now like from a drum, it reminds me
of that explosion. It still rings in my head,'' said Ben Mpagizi, a
15-year-old who said he lost 10 relatives in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''My elder brother died in the fire. He used to go there
frequently for prayers. When the fire broke out, people were
singing,'' said Amosi Mugisha. ''We ran to the scene, but up to now
we do not know how it started.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not identify my brother's remains from the other
bodies because most were already ashes. I and many others who lost
relatives will live with this nightmare throughout our lives.''

<HEADLINE> Regents propose need-based aid to libraries  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's libraries would receive
need-based state aid in order to achieve funding of at least $20
for each person in the areas they serve under a proposal announced
by education officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, approved by the state Board of Regents, would help
stabilize the large disparity in library funding that's currently
occurring, Regents Chancellor Carl Hayden said. Per capita support
now ranges from less than $1 to more than $150, with the statewide
average at $32 per person.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers use library services at a rate almost 10 percent
above the national average, but for millions of New Yorkers ...
their home libraries may be barely able to provide the most basic
services,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Calculation for state aid would be made in a similar fashion to
the way public school aid is currently distributed, with
communities with the lowest wealth receiving the most funding.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner Richard Mills said the program would cost
the state $30 million or less a year, on top of the $88 million
that the state currently spends on its libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Presently 80 percent of public library funding is from local
sources, 10 percent from private sources and 10 percent from the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The program was one of several recommendations made by the
Regents Commission on Library Services and adopted by the Regents,
who will now develop a legislative proposal to address the needs of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents Friday also urged all public libraries to become
part of public library districts, which will need to put their
budget to a public vote and will be overseen by an elected board of
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's 740 public libraries, 135 currently submit their
budgets for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voting and higher resources go hand in hand,'' Mills said.
''People really like their libraries. They like to vote for them,
they like to put the money behind them, but there are only a few
communities that can do that now.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1.3 million New Yorkers currently live outside the service
areas of public libraries, and so creation of public library
districts would also guarantee access to everyone, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Regents approved an alternative teacher
certification program to address teacher shortages statewide. The
plan is designed to propel those who already have a bachelor's
degree but lack education courses to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, applicants must have a 3.0 overall grade
point average in college and majored in the subject area they plan
to teach. They will need to pass the state's certification exams in
the arts and sciences and in their subject area before they begin
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, potential teachers must undergo 200 hours of
''effective teaching'' training in the summer months to acquaint
themselves with the basics of teaching strategies, classroom
management and state standards.
</P>
<P>
   Those who complete the summer training session will receive a
two-year transitional certificate and can then begin teaching in
actual classrooms under the supervision of a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   These teachers will also have to complete teaching skills
courses during the school year that will count toward their
master's degrees in education, which they have to eventually get to
continue being teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea here is to get good, highly qualified people to teach
in our schools. This is not a strategy to provide a backdoor to the
profession for the unqualified,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative teaching program will have to be operated by
colleges registered with the state Education Department. It will be
available in New York City at the end of this month and statewide
in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Accordionists Seek Some Respect  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- No Lawrence Welk-style bubbles float by.
There's seldom a polka. And don't even think of requesting ''Lady
of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   To the 200 or so people roaming the nation's capital with
accordions strapped across their chests this weekend, the
much-maligned squeezebox is so ''retro'' it's become hip.
</P>
<P>
   There are up-and-coming preteen and teen-age musicians playing
rock and jazz accordion, not to mention the blond who appeared in a
Playboy photo spread wearing nothing but her accordion.
</P>
<P>
   The American Accordionists' Association is in the midst of an
image makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's parents wanted nothing to do with the accordion
because their parents were playing them in the '50s. Now you have a
generation that, if older people didn't tell them about it, they
wouldn't know the accordion existed. So it's new again and very
cool,'' said Faithe Deffner, president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Deffner, who has been playing the accordion for 30
years, and the other so-called ''old-timers'' get a tad defensive
if someone dares ask whether the accordion is just for
octogenarians of German descent playing polkas in beer halls.
</P>
<P>
   They note with pride that their convention, which wraps up
Sunday, features a seminar on ''The Accordion in Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   They quickly point out that ''with-it'' musicians including k.d.
lang, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Peter Holsapple of Hootie and the
Blowfish, Sheryl Crow, Charlie Gillingham of Counting Crows and
Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi, among others, play the accordion.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Phoebe Legere and her backup band, the Hot
Hairy Hunks. Her nothing-on-but-an-accordion pictures aside,
Legere's brand of alternative pop, rock, jazz, Cajun and French
music has drawn a whole new audience to the squeezebox in New York
City's trendy nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that 13-year-old Cory Pesaturo started playing the accordion
because of its newfound sex appeal. He utters a shy, ''I don't
know,'' when asked whether girls prefer accordion players to say,
drummers.
</P>
<P>
   Cory, who plays pop, rock and jazz, will say, however, that his
friends admire his style.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think it's kind of cool to play something completely
different, you know, because it's not something that anyone would
expect,'' said Cory of Cumberland, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   And while 11-year-old Georgiana Leonard of Dearborn, Mich.,
likes Britney Spears and the Back Street Boys, she's turned a lot
of her friends onto her favorite musician, Frankie Yankovic, the
Polka King from Cleveland who died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of my friends think it's cool. Some think it's dorky,''
she says, crinkling her nose, ''but I like it. It's fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, 80-year-old Merv Conn, who bills himself as the last of
the strolling accordionists, can't help but feel wistful for the
old days, when accordions weren't on the World Wide Web and
Lawrence Welk was hip.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1945, you could pay 75 cents on the boardwalk in Atlantic
City and you could see Bennie Goodman, and me, and a whole bunch of
other players. I still love to play, but there isn't so much of a
demand for strolling accordionists now.''

<HEADLINE> Milk Sickens Thousands in Japan  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan, a nation long dominated by trusted
corporations, was stunned by the news that a leading dairy
manufacturer was temporarily halting production after more than
11,000 people were sickened by its tainted milk.
</P>
<P>
   The food poisoning, which struck last month, stemmed from staph
bacteria in a production-line valve for lowfat milk at a Snow Brand
Milk Products Co. factory in Osaka, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Brand recalled its Osaka plant products and many
supermarkets stopped carrying everything made by the company. There
were allegations in the Japanese media that Snow Brand had used
milk returned from stores, including some with expired freshness
dates, to make other products. Police have begun an investigation
into possible criminal negligence.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the company announced it was halting production at
its 21 plants for about a week. Spokeswoman Kazu Taguchi said
inspections at the plants began Wednesday and the company has
apologized for what happened and acknowledged the possibility some
of its products were recycled.
</P>
<P>
   The food poisoning so shattered consumer confidence that some
Japanese are afraid to buy any milk at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frightening. I'm never going to buy another Snow Brand
product again,'' said Toshiko Akiyama, 52, clutching a French-made
Camembert cheese she had bought instead of locally produced milk
products. ''I'm outraged. I'd trusted them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the staphylococcus aureus bacteria can cause vomiting and
diarrhea, it's not usually deadly. An 84-year-old woman who was
hospitalized after drinking Snow Brand milk died Sunday of a heart
attack, but doctors were investigating whether the death was caused
by food poisoning. At least five people remain hospitalized, Osaka
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles hit another maker, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., this
week, when at least 80 children complained of abdominal pains and a
strange smell in their milk. Morinaga spokesman Shigeo Kurihara
said the likely cause was the stronger disinfectant used on its
crates in response to the food poisoning at Snow Brand.
</P>
<P>
   With its roots in a cooperative of dairy farmers formed in the
1920s, Snow Brand grew into a nationwide brand, gradually fostering
a fondness for milk and cheese among a people more used to fish and
rice. The company's snowflake logo gained recognition throughout
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   What has especially outraged Japanese was Snow Brand's response
to the crisis. Instead of rushing to recall its products, the
company initially appeared preoccupied with its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   TV news footage showed Snow Brand President Tetsuro Ishikawa
snapping at a persistent reporter, ''I haven't slept a wink.''
Ishikawa later said he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response of the company's top management does not reflect
the sense of responsibility that should go hand-in-hand with a food
manufacturer,'' the national Asahi newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The food poisoning is just one more corporate failing fraying
Japan's faith in its once-mighty companies. On Wednesday, a
department store chain, Sogo Co., went bankrupt after public
criticism forced it to turn down a government bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Akira Sato still isn't used to the new brand of
milk at his school. But he acknowledged he was afraid to drink Snow
Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened might happen again,'' the fifth grader said.

<HEADLINE> Action on China Bill Hits Snag  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hopes of Senate passage this month of major
legislation to normalize trade with China dimmed Friday with a
suspension of talks on a parallel bill aimed at punishing China for
weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse could delay the China trade vote until September.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both parties said they had stopped talking on a
compromise to legislation being pushed by Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., that would apply sanctions on China or its business
partners for violations of international treaties on proliferating
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and other senators are seeking a vote on that issue
before the Senate moves to the larger question of putting normal
trade status with China on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   The House in May approved permanent trade status, a precursor to
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and there is
widespread support for the measure in the Senate. But critics of
China's sales of weapons and other military technology to Pakistan
and other countries have demanded that the Senate first act on the
Thompson legislation, which is cosponsored by Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, International Relations Committee Chairman Ben
Gilman, R-N.Y., and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., on Thursday
introduced ''The China Nonproliferation Act,'' a companion to the
Thompson bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the trade bill, including major business groups,
say it is crucial that the Senate vote on it during July. Congress
is off in August for the presidential conventions and will have to
devote much of the remaining month of the session when it returns
to finishing up fiscal 2001 spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who knows the Senate knows it's remarkably easy to
prevent legislation from happening,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Passage of
the trade bill ''is our number one priority,'' he said, and ''if
this isn't put at the top of the list it won't get done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I remind the leader,'' China trade advocate Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., said in a Senate floor exchange with Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., on Thursday, ''it is critical that PNTR (permanent
normal trade relations) come up and be disposed of this month.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from both sides, after a Wednesday meeting, expressed
confidence they could meet the July deadline, but with the
condition a deal was worked out on the Thompson measure.
</P>
<P>
   Lott supports the trade bill but stresses that it must take a
backseat to finishing action on more of the 13 spending bills
Congress must pass for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday he said he wanted to take up the Thompson measure and
finish four more spending bills this month before he could turn to
the China bill. The spending bills are ''the people's business,''
he said. ''There's not that kind of urgency on China PNTR.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said Thompson had offered concessions to
satisfy some of the administration objections to the original bill
including making it more general so it doesn't just apply to China
and targeting sanctions on those specific suppliers who violate
weapons agreements. But they said Democrats side were unwilling to
continue talks because Lott hasn't set a date for taking up the
trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The critical element here is that from the very beginning the
ball has been in Sen. Lott's court to bring the China trade bill to
the floor in July,'' said Michael Siegel, spokesman for Baucus.
''It seems that he has created a question as to how sincere his
intent ever was about scheduling a vote this month.''
</P>
<P>
   The House, meanwhile, next week is scheduled to vote on a
resolution to overturn President Clinton's decision to extend for
another year China's current normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   The annual vote on renewing China's trade status has
traditionally been a source of heated debate on U.S.-China
relations. But this year, with the permanent trade bill already
passed the debate is likely to be more muted and the resolution
easily defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Thompson bill is S. 2645. The trade bills are H.R. 4444 and
S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Voter Registration Extended  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The United Nations extended the
registration deadline for Kosovo's first internationally supervised
election after hearing that some Serbs were considering
participating in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Serb leaders had been refusing to encourage their followers to
register until the United Nations fulfills several demands, chiefly
the return of thousands of Serbs who fled the province after
Yugoslav troops withdrew in June 1999 following the 78-day NATO
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the 15,000-member Turkish minority were also
boycotting to press demands that the Turkish language be considered
equal under the law with Albanian and Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovars of all groups -- Albanian, Serb, Turkish, Gypsies and
others -- now have until the close of business Wednesday to register
for the October municipal elections, according to Daan Everts, head
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe office
here.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline had been Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   OSCE spokesman Roland Bless said Everts met Thursday with Serb
representatives in the Serb town of Gracanica and for the first
time received ''the strongest indication so far'' that ''some
Serbs'' might be interested in registration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was decided to give them time to see whether those
indications produce something tangible,'' Bless said.
</P>
<P>
   After the U.N. announcement, however, the official Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug quoted the hard-line Serb National Council as ruling
out any possibility of Serbs taking part in registration and
elections until Serbs who fled the province last year can return.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovska Mitrovica, the largest Serb enclave, there was
little sign the Serbs would change their minds before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Serbs from this region will not register nor take part in
the vote until Serbs start returning to Kosovo in bigger numbers,''
said Dragisa Milovic, spokesman for community leader Oliver
Ivanovic.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Sergey
Lavrov, also challenged the decision to continue with the October
election without major Serb participation. Lavrov told the U.N.
Security Council on Thursday that lack of participation by the
Serbs ''would distort both the ethnic and the political picture in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Council that
nearly 900,000 applications have been received, virtually all from
ethnic Albanians, who make up a majority in the province. There are
approximately 100,000 Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel said Russian
objections were ''not going to influence our plans for holding
elections in October. We will have elections in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic has demanded a ''symbolic return'' of 1,500 Serbs
within seven days starting Monday. He also insisted that the United
Nations provide a concrete timetable for organizing the return of
another 210,000 non-Albanians who fled the province when Yugoslav
forces evacuated last year.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have been resisting the demand. The outgoing
Kosovo chief of the U.N. refugee agency, Dennis McNamara, said a
premature return of Serbs would only worsen the already tense
ethnic climate in the province.

<HEADLINE> Census To Recount Florida Homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau will recount nearly 71,000
households in south Florida after local Census staffers committed
''substantial procedural errors,'' officials at the agency's
national headquarters said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Census workers will begin visiting the homes in the Hialeah,
Fla., area on July 24, Census spokesman Steve Jost said. The bureau
announced it will install new management and rehire up to 1,000
experienced enumerators from neighboring Census offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are keeping our promise to stay in the field until we are
confident we have done our job, and to exhaust every procedure
designed to produce a better census,'' Census Director Kenneth
Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Census Bureau said the problems in Hialeah
originated because census-takers were incorrectly trained on ''what
should have been intensive efforts to enumerate'' the last few
households which did not return a form.
</P>
<P>
   The Inspector General's office of the Department of Commerce had
been investigating the Hialeah office since June. Rep. Carrie Meek,
D-Fla. had forwarded a complaint to the department, while Rep. Dan
Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's
census panel, had been critical of the agency's response.
</P>
<P>
   Jost said the decision to recount had nothing to do with the
Inspector General's probe. The Commerce Department oversees the
Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The Hialeah cases increase the number of homes that have had to
be recounted to 150,000, or less than 1 percent of the roughly 40
million households nationwide that did not return a form.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am asking all residents to again bear with us and cooperate
with the Census Bureau during this re-enumeration,'' Hialeah Mayor
Raul L. Martinez said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 23, Nasdaq Rises 72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday after the release of new
government data that showed inflationary pressures remain under
control and despite a landmark ruling against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.34 at 10,812.05,
according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip stocks fell into negative territory late in the
session after a Florida jury ordered the cigarette industry to pay
a record $145 billion in damages to Florida smokers. But the Dow
Jones index ended higher after a late wave of buying.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 72.06 at 4,246.62 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 13.39 at 1,509.23.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was down as many investors stayed on the
sidelines ahead a slew of second-quarter company earnings reports
expected next week. Friday's market focused mainly on three new
reports that provided more evidence of a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers,
rose 0.6 percent in June. While that gain was bigger than expected,
it mostly was due to a sharp rise in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which
doesn't include energy or food costs, fell an unexpected 0.1
percent in June, the best showing since January.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, retail sales rose by a slightly
bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent in June, but excluding the
volatile automobile category, sales rose just 0.2 percent, weaker
than expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a third report, industrial production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose an expected 0.2 percent in
June, the slowest pace since September.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports showed that the Federal Reserve's six
interest-rate hikes over the past year were cooling off the
economy's pace and keeping inflation under control. That helped
ease investors' fears that the Fed will raise rates again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earnings are fine, inflation is fine, the world is in good
shape, but people are still a little nervous about the stock
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''We had a very tough spring
and that forced many people to be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks were down across the board. Philip Morris
Companies was down 43.75 cents to $24.563. RJ Reynolds closed down
93.75 cents to $26.188. And Loews Corp., parent of Lorillard
Tobacco, was down 43.75 cents to $63.063.
</P>
<P>
   But the positive economic news helped push banking and financial
stocks higher. J.P. Morgan, which reported strong earnings on
Thursday, gained $4.563 to $128.688, while Citigroup rose $1.313 to
$67.938.
</P>
<P>
   Merck came under some selling pressure, falling $1.813 to $67.25
after a federal advisory panel told the Food and Drug
Administration that the company's Mevacor is a safe and effective
treatment to reduce high cholesterol, but it shouldn't be sold
without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the Nasdaq again, with Amazon.com gaining
$7.50 to $42.50 after an analyst said the Internet retailer isn't
in danger of running out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor shares were mixed, with Altera Corp. gaining
$8.437 to $119.50 after reporting better-than-expected earnings,
while PMC-Sierra dropped $10.375 to $218.563.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 947.26 million
shares, down from 1.02 billion shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.53 at 542.23.

<HEADLINE> On Lazio's home turf, Hillary Clinton takes her message to Long Island farmers </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALVERTON, N.Y. - Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned on her
opponent's home turf Friday, speaking to farmers at one of Long
Island's biggest greenhouse operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York farming deserves just as much attention and support
as any other kind of farming,'' she told several hundred people at
Ivy Acres Farm, in the northeastern Long Island town of Calverton.
But while many said she addressed the issues closest to their
hearts, they said still hadn't decided who'll get their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased to see she's taken an interest in the North Fork
finally,'' said Peggy Ziegler, a sales manager at the farm, which
is one of the biggest greenhouse operations on the island. ''But
I'm still definitely undecided in terms of who I'm going to vote
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the invitation of the Long Island Farm Bureau,
a nonpartisan association of 5,700 farmers, fishermen,
horticulturists, landscapers and others concerned with rural
quality-of-life issues. The bureau also has invited Long Island
native Rep. Rick Lazio, who is vying with Clinton for a U.S. Senate
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Agriculture is the number one issue in New York,'' Clinton
told several hundred community members in a large greenhouse with
rows of marigolds and snapdragons. She stressed the importance of
farmland preservation and said farmers in the state faces obstacles
like high property taxes, high utility costs, suburban sprawl, and
labor shortages.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manville residents sue over lack of warning for rising flood waters </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - For 48 hours, the weather reports were
ominous. A hurricane that had slammed into the Carolinas was on a
track to do serious damage in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But on the evening of Sept. 16, 1999, even as rain fell and
neighbors reported flooded basements, residents of Manville's Lost
Valley section say they had no idea of the trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency warning siren that some assumed would sound if
there was a problem remained silent. They say no police cars or
fire trucks went through the streets blaring warnings to leave the
area.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of trouble for Andrew and Kathy Kuhns came when
their basement windows burst at 10:30 p.m., and flood water rushed
in, inundating the cellar and rising to the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no warning here, nothing,'' Kathy Kuhns said, still
seething 10 months after the floods receded from her home on
Liberty Street. ''The siren didn't go off, there was no broadcast,
no police cars with loudspeakers, no nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   They are among 32 Manville residents suing the borough, claiming
the town failed to alert them to the coming flood. Tropical Storm
Floyd caused an estimated $1 billion in damage to New Jersey
communities, the worst of it in Bound Brook and Manville.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was totally uncalled for,'' Kathy Kuhns said. ''We lost
both our cars, computers, my husband's tools, our furnace, our
electrical panel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kaminski lives on the same street, and he, too, saw flood
waters fill his basement in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   ''By 10:15 p.m., I've got my wife and my 14-year-old son and I
grabbing whatever we could from the basement,'' he said. ''It
started coming in through the sewer, then through the windows. You
could see it rising right up the walls like a bathtub filling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have any warning,'' he said. ''I could have done
things for myself and my elderly neighbors if we had two days'
warning.'' The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated his
losses at $75,000, but that didn't take into account personal
property stored outdoors, including a boat and a motorcycle that
were trashed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rizzo, the attorney representing the residents, said
Manville should have seen trouble coming, and warned residents to
do what they could in order to minimize property damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The borough was aware that flash flooding was coming, and they
took no steps to warn the residents at all,'' he said. ''The
borough got warnings for at least 48 hours of flooding, each
getting more dire than the next, and there was nothing done at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 1996 flood, Rizzo said, police cars fanned out through
the borough to warn residents over loudspeakers that floods were
coming. But that wasn't done during Tropical Storm Floyd, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one's pretending that the loss of houses could have been
prevented,'' Rizzo said. ''But furniture, TVs, stereos, clothing
could all have been moved to the second floor, and autos could have
been moved to higher ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tripodo, the attorney representing Manville, said he had
not seen the lawsuit and declined comment on it, as did Borough
Administrator Gary Garwacke.
</P>
<P>
   Borough officials previously have said they did send
firefighters to residential areas to warn residents of the
flooding, and they claim they activated a siren atop the municipal
building.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said some of the plaintiffs said they heard a faint siren
in the distance, and called police headquarters, but were told not
to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''People on our street called police headquarters and we're
told, 'We're evacuating the other end of town, but don't worry;
you're fine,''' Kaminski said.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said a warning siren in the Lost Valley section had been
inoperative for at least two years before the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Manville has since agreed to upgrade its warning system by
placing four new sirens throughout the borough. But that hasn't
calmed many residents, Rizzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They feel they're still being neglected, and they're afraid
it's going to happen again,'' he said. ''They're afraid that next
time, instead of just loss of property, it's going to be loss of
life, and there were some extremely close calls out there last
time.''

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man used library computer to target wealthy homes for break-ins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Computers are changing the way Americans
work, play and, according to one northern New Jersey police
department, even break into houses.
</P>
<P>
   A Hackensack man is accused of using a computer program at the
public library to case upper-income neighborhoods before deciding
which homes to rob.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bodurka was arrested Wednesday after he allegedly pawned
a stolen bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   Police say he used a commonly available program at the Johnson
Public Library that allows users to zero in on any street in any
region of the country. It also allows a user to match U.S. Census
Bureau data on average household income and housing values with a
particular block.
</P>
<P>
   If a resident has a listed telephone number, his or her name,
phone number and address are available to anyone using the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he felt his odds were better if he did his research
beforehand,'' said Hackensack Police Chief Charles ''Ken'' Zisa.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Bodurka, 32, used the Phone Disc program to plan
burglaries in Bergen and Hudson counties, as well as New York.
</P>
<P>
   He is suspected in break-ins in Franklin Lakes, Park Ridge,
Saddle River, Upper Saddle River, Paramus, and Ramapo, N.Y. He is
charged with theft and attempted burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect, Jason Cruz, 22, who is accused of acting as
Bodurka's getaway driver, also faces burglary charges.

<P>
   YORK, Pa. (AP) - Janet Sindlinger has been a loyal customer of
The Bon-Ton department stores for 50 years and still swears by
their quality goods, simple store layout and free gift-wrapping.
But her teen-age and 20-something-year-old granddaughters have a
different view.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're looking for something to dazzle,'' said Sindlinger,
79, explaining they prefer specialty shops such as The Gap and
American Eagle. ''When I see them buy a top that's so skimpy and
that they won't wear for more than a season, it's like, 'Let's go
to Bon-Ton.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''But that's how it is when you're younger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bon-Ton, a York-based chain founded in 1898 that now has 72
stores located throughout the Northeast, is struggling to stem poor
sales as fickle younger customers shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Its former chief executive officer, Heywood Wilansky, announced
an early retirement last month, and the company now hopes to build
profits by focusing on moderately priced merchandise and presenting
fashion trends as they emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with Bon-Ton is that its customers have gotten far
too old,'' said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Reach
Marketing in Westport, Conn. ''The generation graduating from
school and forming new families today have never felt comfortable
shopping in their grandparents' department stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a steady decline in earnings. Most recently,
Bon-Ton reported first-quarter results amounting to a net loss of
$5.1 million, or 34 cents per share, compared to a loss of $2.9
million, or 19 cents per share, during the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted then-CEO Wilansky, after admitting to ''lousy''
earnings in the past year, to announce in June that the company
would hold off on expansion plans and focus on building profits in
existing stores. Bon-Ton also said it would let go 187 employees,
about 2 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later on June 27, Wilansky announced his retirement.
He was replaced by Tim Grumbacher, chairman of the board of
directors who previously was CEO until Wilansky replaced him in
1995. Grumbacher is a grandson of the chain's founder, Max
Grumbacher.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said the replacement was stirred by a
difference in opinion over the store's future, but Bon-Ton's vice
chairman and chief operating officer, Michael Gleim declined to
comment. Wilansky, a Baltimore resident whose number is unlisted,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Top management is just a little behind the times,'' said Kurt
Barnard, who runs the New Jersey consulting firm Barnard's Retail
Trend Report. ''It's a good store but it has nothing special about
it. A consumer needs to be attracted to a store, and once inside,
needs to be incentivized to make a purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. In their heyday of the 1970s and
1980s, department stores enjoyed robust profits, due mostly to a
lack of competition from other businesses for sales of apparel and
housewares.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bon-Ton, a French term standing for ''good taste-good
fashion,'' carved its niche by opening stores in smaller markets
underserved by larger chains. It presented high-end brands,
including Calvin Klein clothing and Mikasa houseware, and offered
elegant free gift-wrapping for purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But success wore thin by the 1990s, with the rise of specialty
retailers, including Ann Taylor. Meanwhile, Bon-Ton faced an attack
from more general merchandise stores such as Wal-Mart, Kohl's and
Target, which broadened its youth appeal with colorful signs and
catchy advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a whole new generation of 18- to 34-year-olds who grew
up with Wal-Mart as their department store,'' said Candace Corlett,
a partner at New York-based WSL Strategic Retail. ''So the masses
are going to mass merchandisers, and caught in the middle are
regional upscale stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Bon-Ton says it is confident it can improve sales and does not
expect ''radical'' changes. Along with cutting staff and
restructuring management to get rid of three senior positions, it
will offer more moderately priced merchandise - a $200 suit rather
than a $400 one, or a $20 T-shirt rather than a $40 product.
</P>
<P>
   The company also will more actively monitor fashion trends,
change the name of some of its clothing lines to snazzier titles
such as ''Club X'' and target younger shoppers with special
mail-outs, Gleim said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The younger generation tends to like to shop the specialty
shops, and they don't necessarily, as a matter of principle, want
to shop where their mom shops,'' he said. ''But it's clear the
younger generation of today are the future customers of tomorrow,
so we need to be more exciting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Grace Klemmer, 18, and Lisa Martin, 19, who were shopping
recently at the York Galleria, they said very little could convince
them to give up on their favorite stores, Timberland, Old Navy and
Hot Topic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't shop (at Bon-Ton) for myself, only if I were
getting stuff for my parents or my brother,'' said Klemmer of York.
''The whole second floor is devoted to housewares - what teen-ager
needs that stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Martin, also of York: ''If they don't have the right
style, I won't buy no matter how cheap it is.''

<HEADLINE> Jimmy McDonald, an original Freedom Rider, dies at 69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Jimmy McDonald, whose activism in civil rights
took him aboard a bus bound for the south to take on racial
inequality in the 1960s, died on Tuesday after a brief illness at
Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was one of 14 original members of the Freedom Riders,
who worked against Jim Crow segregation laws in the South. The bus
was bombed during his trip.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 interview with The Atlanta Journal and Constitution,
McDonald said: ''The very fact that as an American one could not
travel interstate without the humiliation of sitting in the back of
the bus. Or sit in a restaurant and get a decent meal, that in
itself was humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, McDonald continued his advocacy for civil
rights. As a member of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People in Yonkers, N.Y., he attempted to increase
minority voting turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a passion for civil rights,'' his sister Jeanette
Bullock said. ''He definitely believed in them and he did something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald worked in the entertainment industry, and hosted two
television programs, ''Black Journal'' and ''Black Perspective on
the News.'' He went on to serve as the executive director of the
Human Rights Commission in Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald is survived by his wife, Ella Wease Seabrook McDonald;
his son, Creighton Seabrook McDonald, and numerous other relatives.

<HEADLINE> More Bodies Found in India Landslide  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Frequently using bare hands, soldiers and
firefighters retrieved more bodies Friday from a landslide that
buried a shantytown. The confirmed death toll rose to 71 but was
expected to rise past 100.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers said witnesses estimated that 40 missing people
could still be buried under mud and boulders.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still a strong smell at the site, so there is a
possibility that more bodies are still under the debris,'' said
Pravin Chheda, a city councilor.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers sprayed insecticide and eucalyptus oil to fight flies
and the stench of decomposing corpses. And authorities ordered 200
masks for relief workers who have been working in shifts to dig out
bodies since the landslide struck on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, more than 100 people waited on a narrow road leading
to the devastated area for word on the fate of loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   In Bombay, skies cleared after two days of heavy monsoon rains.
Knee-deep water receded and buses and trains resumed service in the
city of nearly 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But incessant rains continued to lash other parts of the western
states of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the southern state of Andhra
Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   Including those killed in the landslide, 135 people have died in
the storms since Wednesday, Press Trust of India news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The army rescued more than 3,000 people in Gujarat state which
recorded 22 inches of rain in the past two days, the highest in
nearly five decades, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
   Clear skies made the recovery operation easier but municipal
workers had mostly given up hope of finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers plowed down 40 tin and concrete huts to make a path
to the hill where poor migrants had built their homes in Azad Nagar
shanty in northeastern Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   As dump trucks loaded with debris lumbered past, relatives
huddled near the site to identify and collect battered corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Miya, 27, offered prayers at the Gaibansha burial ground
for two sons lost in the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how I managed to get out. How I wish I had got
hold of my sons and pushed them out first,'' he said. Miya said he
would wait to tell his wife about the children until she recovered
from her own injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At least 46 people are recovering in two hospitals from head
injuries and fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Most victims were poor migrants from southern and central Indian
states who had left their villages in the hope of earning more
money in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the shantytown said they had been ordered to leave
before the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew our homes were unsafe,'' said carpenter Hassan Ali,
32. ''But we have nowhere else to go.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Malaria Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON(AP) -- Americans won a new drug Friday to prevent
malaria when they travel to countries ravaged by the mosquito-borne
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Malarone, the first
new anti-malaria option in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is a parasitic infection that is one of the world's
worst scourges. It sickens at least 300 million people every year
and kills up to 2.7 million. Drugs and insecticides have made it
rare in developed countries, but it is almost impossible to escape
in tropical, developing nations. Worse, it is evolving to resist
many treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle ache and
malaise. Without prompt treatment, kidney failure and other
problems can cause death. People who become ill with a fever during
or after tropical travel should see a doctor and make sure to
mention the trip, the FDA advised. Also, people planning travel to
a malaria-endemic country should see a doctor first about
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome Inc.'s Malarone was approved to prevent and treat
malaria in adults and children. It combines two medications:
atovaquone, used to treat lung infections in immune-compromised
patients, and proguanil, an old malaria therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In four clinical trials in Africa, two out of 279 people who
used Malarone for three months developed malaria. In comparison, 92
out of another 297 people who took a placebo developed malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Another eight clinical trials in countries in Africa, Asia,
South America and Europe concluded Malarone is an effective malaria
treatment, too.
</P>
<P>
   The main side effects were headache and abdominal pain; children
also reported vomiting and itching.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo said the prescription drug will be available in mid-August
but would not reveal a price.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer presses for tougher Canadian emissions standards  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York's attorney general is pressing U.S.
Secretary of State Madeline Albright to lobby the Canadian
government to adopt stricter emissions standards at coal-burning
plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Albright, Eliot Spitzer said nitrogen oxide and
sulfur dioxide emissions from Eastern Canada's aging power plants
''are among the leading contributors to acid precipitation'' in New
York and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain is blamed for killing aquatic plants and trees in the
Adirondacks and other parts of the Northeast and making some lakes
and streams so acidic they are unable to support fish.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are negotiating with Canada over an annex
agreement to the Trans-Boundary Air Quality Agreement. In his July
5 letter, Spitzer urged Albright to press Canadian representatives
''to commit to significant reductions in emissions'' as part of
that pact.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the State Department on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency is requiring
nearly 400 power plants and industrial boilers in a dozen
Midwestern states to dramatically reduce emissions that cause smog.
</P>
<P>
   Prevailing winds carry the smog produced by coal-burning plants
in the Midwest and Canada to the Northeast. Acid precipitation is
caused when nitrogen and sulfur in the smog mix with airborne
moisture and fall as rain or snow.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said that when the U.S. plants emissions reductions are
fully in place by 2003, the U.S. standards will be three times as
stringent as Canada's. He pointed in particular to pollution from
the Nanticoke, Ontario generating station. The station is the
largest single emitter of nitrogen and sulfur in North America and
is located just 63 miles upwind of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has already sued power plants and electric utilities in
Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia, seeking a reduction in
their acid rain-causing emissions
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general isn't the only one pressing for Canada to
tighten up it's emissions guidelines. A coalition of 20
environmental and health groups are urging Canadian premiers and
governors from the Northeastern United States to take steps to
reduce mercury pollution, which comes from coal-burning power
plants and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Academy of Sciences on Tuesday that while most
people are not at high risk of health problems from low-dose
mercury exposure, children of women who consume large amounts of
fish and seafood during their pregnancy may be ''at special risks''
of having neurological problems.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are expected to ease the way for the EPA to develop
new regulations requiring a reduction of mercury emissions from
coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The science is in. Mercury is highly toxic,'' Michael Bender,
director of the Mercury Policy Project, said.

<HEADLINE> OTC Cholesterol Pill Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- It's a dilemma: Too few Americans use
potentially life-saving anti-cholesterol pills, prompting a push to
sell those drugs over the counter. Yet it takes blood tests to know
if the pills are working, and what if people who really need a
doctor's more aggressive treatment self-medicate instead?
</P>
<P>
   Government advisers took the cautious route on the question this
week, declaring that Americans shouldn't use the cholesterol drugs
Mevacor or Pravachol without a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are interested in playing a role in their own health
care,'' said Edwin Hemwall of Mevacor manufacturer Merck &AMP; Co., who
complained that patients now turn to unproven herbs and dietary
supplements. ''They deserve to have better options.''
</P>
<P>
   But advisers to the Food and Drug Administration concluded
neither Merck nor Pravachol maker Bristol-Myers Squibb proved it
can safely sell a nonprescription dose of these powerful
cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as ''statins,'' to the right
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The main risk is that nonprescription therapy ''will be viewed
by consumers as alleviating the need for intensive care,'' Dr. Eric
Brass of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center said Thursday as his panel
recommended that FDA reject over-the-counter Mevacor. Friday, the
same panel rejected OTC Pravachol, too.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a blow to some physician groups, including the
American Medical Women's Association and Association of Black
Cardiologists, that argue nonprescription therapy could help fight
heart disease, the nation's top killer.
</P>
<P>
   Some 53 million Americans have high cholesterol. Only a small
fraction of those with the worst cholesterol levels use
prescription medication. Many don't know they have high
cholesterol; others don't have insurance coverage for prescription
drugs. Plus, many doctors don't follow federal prescribing
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about a third of heart attacks occur in patients whose
cholesterol is higher than optimal but not high enough for
prescription therapy -- levels of 200 to 240.
</P>
<P>
   It is those moderate-risk patients -- 15 million people -- that
Merck and Bristol-Myers want to target, by selling them low doses
of Mevacor and Pravachol over-the-counter. Higher-dose versions of
the drugs would remain prescription-only. (That, however, is a
technicality since simply swallowing more pills increases the
dose.)
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA advisers complained that:
</P>
<P>
   --Patients don't seem to understand cholesterol well enough to
self-medicate. In one study, half the people who thought they were
candidates for over-the-counter Mevacor were wrong. Their
cholesterol was either so high they needed a doctor's care, or too
low to even consider drugs.
</P>
<P>
   --How to ensure nonprescription patients get blood tests to know
if their cholesterol is responding to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   --While high-dose statins have proved life-saving and even
low-dose Mevacor can lower cholesterol, Merck never proved that a
mere 10 milligrams a day would prevent heart attacks in
moderate-risk patients.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even Merck's best analysis estimated that 60 to 70
people would have to use low-dose Mevacor regularly to prevent one
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA isn't bound by its advisers' recommendations but
typically follows them.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision isn't truly fair to Merck, one panelist
acknowledged. A dietary supplement called Cholestin contains the
same cholesterol-lowering ingredient as Mevacor yet, because of a
law Congress passed in 1994, is allowed to sell over-the-counter
without any FDA safety oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a clear paradox,'' said Dr. Richard Neill of the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''two wrongs don't make a right,'' countered Dr. William
Tamborlane of Yale University.

<HEADLINE> Portrait Delivered to White House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If not for the Mideast negotiations at Camp
David, President Clinton might have been at the White House on
Friday when an art student from Ohio arrived with a gift: a
portrait of the president and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   What made the drawing unusual was the canvass he used: an Etch A
Sketch.
</P>
<P>
   George Vlosich III of Lakewood, Ohio, has been turning his agile
touch with the twin-knobbed doodling toy into fun and profit. He's
already met Clinton and Gore. He has earned commissions in excess
of $3,000 for a single drawing. And he's even been hired by Yahoo's
internet auction site to do a special picture of baseball great Cal
Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   After completing a drawing, Vlosich removes the toy's red
plastic backing to dislodge the stylus and excess aluminum powder.
That makes the image unshakeable.
</P>
<P>
   Vlosich already had shown his Clinton/Gore portrait-in-progress
to both the president and vice president during separate meetings
arranged by Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. So he didn't mind much
when both dispatched staffers to accept copies of the finished
product.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Cleveland Institute of Art student said getting
inside the White House and private tour that included the Oval
Office was fun, but as his Etch A Sketch reputation has grown, he's
become a bit nonchalant about famous faces and places.
</P>
<P>
   An exception: meeting basketball legend Michael Jordan. ''That
was the only one I was nervous about,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush voices support for Lazio in New York campaign appearance  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio shelved
his ''mainstream'' moniker for a few hours Friday afternoon,
reveling with members of the state Conservative Party at a luncheon
that also featured GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush and
New York Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The rally before several hundred at a Manhattan hotel, including
former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and musician Lionel
Hampton, featured Bush as the main speaker, but was also intended
to focus attention on Lazio's race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, it's kind of easy to get carried away bashing
Hillary,'' said state Conservative Party chairman Michael Long. ''I
admit sometimes when I hear people arguing about the horrible
foreign menace that has suddenly appeared in New York, I don't know
if they're talking about the West Nile Virus or Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The strident talk is the latest in a series of verbal missiles
hurled at the Clinton camp by Lazio and his compatriots. In a
fund-raising letter last week, Lazio referred to the president and
first lady as having ''embarrassed the country and disgraced their
powerful posts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate fund-raising letter obtained Thursday by The
Associated Press, New York Republican Party chairman William Powers
excoriated Clinton as ''abrasive and annoying, brash and bitter,
calculating and scheming, distant and deceitful, polarizing and
power hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   And Forbes penned a letter on behalf of Lazio that said, ''Deep
down, Hillary knows that her wild-eyed radical leftist views will
repel the voters. That's why she engages in a predictable pattern
of shameless hypocrisy, perpetual pandering and cruel scapegoating
against her opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who dubbed his campaign bus the ''Mainstream Express''
and frequently insists that his political views are not as
right-wing as critics suggest, was warmly greeted after being
introduced by Long.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very, very proud to be the nominee of the Conservative
Party,'' said Lazio, who received the endorsement of party brass
last month. The added line on the November ballot is viewed as
critical for victory; no Republican seeking statewide office in New
York has won without Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a congressman I have waited eight long years to work with a
president who will sign good bills into law,'' Lazio said to Bush
from the podium. ''Governor, I can taste it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also joined the backslapping brigade, saying of Lazio,
''It's going to be quite a moment when the sitting vice president
performs his last official duty and that is to swear in the new
United States senator, Rick Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning on Long Island on Friday, Clinton called her
opponent's position on abortion ''far from certain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that my opponent has some questions to answer about
his commitment to issues that he claims to support,'' she said at a
farm in Calverton. ''I'd like him to try to explain his record.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the New York State Nurses Association took issue
with a Lazio television ads in which he claims support for a
Patients' Bill of Rights. Phyllis Collins, president of the
organization, which says it was the first health group to endorse
Clinton, said the group supports Clinton because ''she is a leading
advocate for improving the quality of health care and for providing
coverage for all.''

<HEADLINE> Towns rally against tribes seeking recognition  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTON, Conn. (AP) - Leaders from 10 Connecticut cities and
towns say they will join forces to fight federal recognition
petitions filed by several Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The group met at Shelton City Hall Friday to discuss pending
applications for recognition by the Golden Hill Paugussetts in
Trumbull, the Schaghticokes in Kent, and the Eastern Pequot and
Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes in North Stonington.
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders said they were concerned with recent changes in the
approval process used by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs which
appear to make it easier for tribes to gain recognition, a status
that allows them to build gaming casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti called the meeting to ask officials
from nearby towns to join Shelton's application for intervenor
status in the Paugussett case. That would allow the towns to make
their case to the BIA.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who also attended the
meeting, has called for a moratorium on recognition petitions,
claiming the BIA's process has become too political and too
susceptible to pressure and influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process basically is broken and we need to fix it,''
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a tribe gains federal recognition, its land is removed from
state and municipal tax rolls, it is exempt from zoning and
environmental laws, and its development projects - often gambling
casinos - can cause enormous traffic problems for the areas in
which they are built, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about being for or against Native Americans,'' he
said. It's not being for or against gambling. It's not a partisan
issue or a geographic issue. It affects everyone in the whole state
of Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the meeting said they are concerned about claims
the Paugussetts made in 1993 for thousands of acres of land in
Bridgeport and its surrounding suburbs, including Shelton. Some
claims were thrown out of state court but a federal court says it
will consider others once a decision on federal recognition is
made.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet Hawk, council chief of the Paugussetts, has said
repeatedly that the tribe will drop the land claims if it is
granted recognition in exchange for land in Bridgeport on which it
would build a casino.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, after hearing about the mounting opposition from
local officials, the chief said he may consider filing additional
land claims for what it considers ancestral property.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years, these people have been telling the tribe to go
through the federal recognition process,'' Quiet Hawk said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not filed those (additional) land claims because I've
been trying to do as they asked me to do. It's not my intention to
do harm to people. However, I have a tribal nation to be
responsible for. These people have to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paugusetts, which have small reservations in Trumbull and
Colchester, sought federal recognition in 1993. The petition was
rejected three times, before the agency decided in May 1999 to
reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from Friday's meeting was any representative
of Bridgeport. City officials there generally favor federal
recognition for the Paugussetts because of the economic benefits a
casino could bring to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders from southeastern Connecticut, where the
Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans already run successful
casinos, expressed their concern about the Eastern Pequots and
Paucatuck Eastern Pequots - who have received preliminary approval
for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Ledyard Mayor Wesley Johnson said he and other officials in the
area want to make sure the process is fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are a legitimate tribe, we're willing to deal with
whatever comes after that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is asking the Department of
Interior to postpone a decision to grant recognition to the two
Eastern Pequot tribes. He says troubling questions have been raised
about the recognition process.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo dated March 16, BIA head Kevin Gover acknowledges
concerns raised by his staff about whether the two eastern tribes
meet all federal criteria for recognition, but says that their long
histories make it reasonable to infer that they have always existed
as organized political and social entities.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the Department of the Interior issued a
preliminary decision favoring recognition of the tribes.

<HEADLINE> 18 Die in South Korea Bus Accident  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Buses carrying high school students
and tourists crashed on a rain-slick highway and caught fire
Friday, killing at least 18 people and injuring almost 100.
</P>
<P>
   Fire broke out on three of the buses, one with tourists and two
carrying students, police said. A fourth bus, also holding
students, rolled off the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students were jumping out of the bus windows. And suddenly I
heard blasts for three, four minutes and black smokes and flames
began coming out of the buses,'' the national news agency Yonhap
quoted a witness, Sohn Hee-mo, 54, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dead, 14 were students, said YTN, an all-news cable
channel. Four others were found dead in two cars but were so badly
burned that immediate identification was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-seven people were injured, said police Sgt. Cho Moon-ho.
Some were in serious condition, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
   The students of Pooil Foreign Language High School in Pusan, a
port on the southeastern coast, were on their way back home from a
field trip to resort mountains on the east coast when the crashes
took place.
</P>
<P>
   The collisions near Kimchon, 133 miles southeast of Seoul,
occurred when a truck crashed into a fence on the nation's main
turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   TV footage later showed police rescuers picking through the
buses and cars burned down to blackened frames. Police used a giant
crane to pull up a crumpled bus.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal calls Florida tobacco verdict historic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal, who helped negotiate a $200 billion national settlement
with Big Tobacco in 1998, lauded Friday's $145 billion damage award
to smokers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It ''sends a powerful signal that Big Tobacco will be held
accountable for the addiction and disease it causes everyday, and
that it will pay for continuing to lure children into its death
trap,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Combined with the states' successful lawsuits, and other
private actions, it will help compensate for the harm done by
nicotine and tobacco, and hopefully stop kids from starting to
smoke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, a strong opponent of the tobacco industry, said the
verdict should not endanger the settlement payments to Connecticut
or any state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The companies have the financial capacity to pay us as well as
these verdicts in private actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is in line to receive $3.6 billion from tobacco over
the next 25 years, part of the settlement 46 states won in their
class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The state will get about $300 million of those funds by the end
of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Russian Missile Proposal Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Friday stepped into a
heated debate among Russia's top military brass over a plan to
downgrade the country's nuclear forces, saying such disputes should
not be aired in public.
</P>
<P>
   Putin scolded the army leaders after his usually low-key Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, blasted the plan to fold Russia's Strategic
Rocket Forces into the air force. The step would lower the status
of the rocket forces, which Sergeyev used to head.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said the proposal, advocated by Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin,
the head of the General Staff, amounted to ''criminal stupidity and
an attempt to harm the national interests of Russia,'' the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The move would ''destroy'' the rocket forces and was ''a crime
against Russia and simply madness,'' Sergeyev was quoted as saying.
He also reportedly had threatened to resign if Kvashnin's plan won
out, but later said he was misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual public fight among the top generals, accustomed to
settling their disputes behind closed doors, was apparently too
much for Putin, who along with Sergeyev was visiting an arms show
in the Sverdlovsk region 900 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a serious, principal decision on which the country's
future is depending,'' Putin said. ''Such decisions cannot be taken
within a closed circle but they cannot be debated in public.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision ''will strengthen national defense capability,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev, meanwhile, called for public support ''from all who
are not indifferent to Russia's fate, to the security of its people
and its place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin's plan, discussed at a meeting of military officials
earlier this week, would overturn Sergeyev's competing idea to put
the nuclear capabilities of the navy and air force under an
expanded missile force, to be renamed the Strategic Deterrent
Force.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute are inter-service rivalries as well
as differing views of how to guarantee Russia's security, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev and his followers think nuclear deterrence is the key
to Russia's security as its conventional forces have deteriorated
due to economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Other generals, however, argue that Russia needs to buy
conventional equipment to meet threats like the rebellion against
Russian rule in Chechnya. Military analysts say Russian soldiers in
the region even lack night-vision equipment, essential for fighting
guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Aide Addresses Worshippers  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM HAZBOUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A leading aide to Yasser Arafat addressed
thousands of worshippers Friday at Islam's third-holiest site,
telling them Jerusalem ''will always be an Arab city.''
</P>
<P>
   The sermon by Yusef Salameh, a Muslim cleric, at Friday prayers
at Al-Aqsa mosque was aimed as much at negotiators attending the
Camp David summit as it was at the worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you, the Palestinians and the Arabs, we are here for
more than 5,000 years, and Jerusalem is the only capital for the
Palestinians,'' Salameh said. ''It will always be an Arab,
Palestinian city.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is at Camp David this week for a U.S.-sponsored summit
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. The meeting is an attempt
to bridge the gaps on core Israeli-Palestinian disputes: final
borders of a Palestinian state, the question of whether Palestinian
refugees can return to Israeli land and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are demanding a capital in Jerusalem's
traditionally Arab eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war. Barak does not want to cede the whole sector, but
he reportedly has offered Arafat a compromise centering on the
Al-Aqsa mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The mosque abuts the holiest site in Judaism, the outer western
wall of the Second Temple, which was destroyed in 70 A.D. Tensions
over who controls the area led to bloody riots in 1929 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in the Maariv daily on Friday, Barak
offered Arafat a ''safe passage'' -- a contiguous area of
Palestinian control from the Al Aqsa compound to outlying West Bank
suburbs of Jerusalem that some Israeli officials have proposed
could serve as a Palestinian capital. Arafat refused, Maariv said,
insisting on full sovereignty in the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It was a message reflected in Salameh's sermon -- and not lost on
worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Civil administration over (east) Jerusalem, as Barak has
suggested, is not enough,'' said Ibrahim Shabalin, a laborer who
attended services. ''It must be under Palestinian sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is under pressure from conservative Israelis, who say the
territorial concessions he is contemplating are too far-reaching to
be achieved without further debate in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, hundreds of Jewish settlers demonstrated at shopping
centers and junctions, handing out stickers declaring, ''Barak is
losing the country.'' Barak supporters counter-demonstrated in
similar numbers.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Accuses on Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Ramping up an already hot campaign issue, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert accused the Clinton administration Friday of
misleading the public about what caused gas prices to soar in the
Midwest. The administration denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert alleged Vice President Al Gore and others suggested
price gouging by oil companies was to blame even though they had a
memo from a top Energy Department official that said other factors
were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowhere does this document indicate, or imply, that price
gouging was a factor; nor has any other study or investigation,''
Hastert, R-Ill., wrote to Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet you continued to point the finger at anyone other than
where the responsibility truly lies. I certainly hope that this was
not a coordinated strategy by (EPA), the Department of Energy and
the vice president's office.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration spokesman dismissed Hastert's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are unfortunately just playing politics with gas prices,
which we think is unconscionable,'' EPA spokesman Dave Cohen said.
''What we have said on this from day one has been entirely
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices increased throughout the country this spring, but
soared far above the rest of the nation in Chicago and Milwaukee
starting in May -- angering motorists and their representatives in
Congress. It also set off a series of attacks between Gore and his
Republican rival for the presidency, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans blamed the price rise mostly on stricter EPA
pollution-reduction rules that took effect this summer in the
nation's smoggiest cities and the complications of producing
reformulated fuel in the Midwest, where ethanol is used to make gas
burn cleaner. They also criticized the Clinton administration for
pursuing an energy policy that they said thwarts domestic oil
production.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, noted huge campaign contributions to
Republicans and Bush from the oil industry, and said price-fixing,
not environmental regulations, was more likely responsible for the
high prices. They acknowledged the EPA rules likely were
responsible for part of the price rise, but only four to eight
cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   At their peak last month, prices in Chicago reached $2.33 a
gallon -- 65 cents per gallon over the already high national
average.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hastert distributed a June 5 internal memo from
Energy Department acting policy office director Melanie Kenderdine
assessing gasoline supplies in the Milwaukee and Chicago areas.
</P>
<P>
   The document concluded ''sufficient supply is available to meet
overall demand at this time'' in the Milwaukee and Chicago markets.
But it also noted that a ''very tight'' supply was putting some
pressure on prices there and meant that any disruptions could
trigger shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The memo attributed the situation to, among other things, low
inventories of reformulated gasoline in the Midwest, the complexity
of refining that blend, limited alternative supply sources and
previous pipeline problems that interrupted deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ''These supply issues will affect price but the degree to which
they contribute to price spikes is unknown,'' Kenderdine wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert contends the memo shows Gore, Browner and others knew
the spikes were caused mainly by stricter pollution-reduction rules
but blamed oil companies instead. In his letter, he accused Browner
of intentionally misleading the public, as well as Midwestern
lawmakers during two meetings last month.
</P>
<P>
   After those meetings, Browner said federal officials determined
there was no explanation for the dramatic differential between
prices at Midwestern pumps and those elsewhere. The Federal Trade
Commission then launched a still-ongoing investigation into whether
price-fixing was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire point of the memo is to say the supply ... was
tight but adequate, which is what we've always said,'' Cohen said.
''The ethanol blend ... was never remotely enough to create the
kind of price spikes we saw.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen Resistance To Russia Grows  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHASAVYURT, Russia (AP) -- As a top rebel leader said Friday that
resistance to Russian rule in Chechnya was growing, the Kremlin's
chief spokesman on the breakaway republic again rejected
international mediation in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky came
after Chechen separatist President Aslan Maskhadov called for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to help the two
sides work out an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal center believes that the anti-terrorist operation
in Chechnya must be brought to a conclusion,'' Yastrzhembsky told
the Interfax news agency. ''Neither the OSCE nor any other
international organizations can mediate in Chechnya. We reject
international mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has steadfastly maintained that the Chechen conflict was
an internal affair. Yastrzhembsky said the only issue the Russians
would discuss was the rebels' surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Though Yastrzhembsky and other Russian officials have repeatedly
predicted rebel defeat, rebel commander Shamil Basayev said in an
interview released Friday that between 30-40 Russian soldiers were
dying each day in Chechnya and resistance to the Russians was
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev's casualty figure far exceeds Russian reports. During
the conflict, both sides have exaggerated the other's losses and
minimized their own.
</P>
<P>
   The military command acknowledged Friday that three soldiers
were killed in the last 24 hours, while several were wounded in an
ambush on a column in western Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev, who lost a foot when he stepped on a mine Jan. 31, said
the rebels would not back down ''because we want to live
independently from the Russian empire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we can assess the situation as positive for us,
especially considering the growth in resistance to the Russian
occupiers and the general uprising of national liberation,''
Basayev said in the interview, videotaped last week by the
Azerbaijan News Service. The tape was made available Friday by
Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev, wearing a black beret and camouflage jacket, stirred
sugar into a cup of tea and appeared to have recovered from his
wound, suffered as he and his fighters abandoned the capital
Grozny. He was seated in front of a flag with Arabic writing in a
dimly-lit room.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have taken control of most of Chechnya after
rolling into the rebellious region 10 months ago. Guerrillas such
as Basayev have eluded Russian forces by using forests and
mountains to conceal their movements and encampments.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev, 35, was a leading guerrilla commander in the 1994-96
war in which Chechen independence fighters forced Russia to accept
a cease-fire and withdraw its troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman, called Basayev one of
Russia's most important targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basayev is one of the most uncompromising field commanders,''
Yastrzhembsky said, according to Interfax. ''The policy of
neutralizing Basayev and those siding with him is now imperative.''

<HEADLINE> White House Is Retrieving E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An independent auditor hired to review the
retrieval of White House e-mails told a federal judge Friday that
he was never told of the judge's order to produce the messages
promptly.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony from Gregory Ekberg came at the end of a lengthy
pretrial hearing in a civil lawsuit against the White House. Ekberg
of Vistronix, a McLean, Va., information technology company, said
he had never heard of U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth's order,
filed last April, to produce the e-mails as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the White House said it hoped to have a system in
place by June.
</P>
<P>
   Ekberg testified earlier Friday that new and reliable equipment,
approved by the FBI on Thursday, is helping the White House
reassemble thousands of missing and once-thought irretrievable
e-mails sought in a lawsuit against the Clinton administration. He
and another White House computer specialist said a searchable
database of the e-mails could be delivered to the judge in four
weeks to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But under direct questioning from Lamberth Friday, Ekberg said
he was never told of any orders to produce the e-mails promptly.
</P>
<P>
   The judge seemed incredulous when Ekberg, whose job is to review
the entire project on an ongoing basis, said the judge's order had
never been discussed. Ekberg said the only deadline he was given
required the e-mails to be copied by the end of 2000 -- and that
came from a subcontractor hired by White House, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ekberg's exchange with the judge came after several hours on the
witness stand, during which he said workers struggled with three
computer systems that either failed to copy the e-mails from master
tapes or couldn't produce exact copies, as required in the case. He
said a fourth system, approved Thursday by the FBI, is now in use.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived and were lost because of a computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the messages were never reviewed by White House
lawyers to determine if they should be turned over to investigators
under subpoena in cases ranging from the Monica Lewinsky scandal
and Whitewater to campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth is holding the hearings to determine how to get the
messages to investigators. Testimony was expected to continue
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an apparent programming error, incoming e-mail
messages dating back to August 1996 were not searched in response
to subpoenas by the Justice Department and congressional
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, Independent Counsel Robert Ray and the Justice
Department are investigating whether the e-mail problem was an
innocent mistake, as the White House contends, or part of an effort
to obstruct their investigations into the Lewinsky scandal and the
White House's gathering of the FBI files of past Republican
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans say the White House has dragged its feet in
solving the problem and threatened technicians who revealed the
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by the conservative legal group Judicial
Watch. The group's general counsel, Larry Klayman, told Lamberth
that the White House intentionally hired consultants with little
expertise in restoring the data in order to delay the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., urged White House counsel
Beth Nolan and Attorney General Janet Reno to support appointment
of an outside expert to supervise the e-mail effort.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the House Government Reform Committee, which he
heads, ''has no confidence that the White House will satisfy its
obligations to produce information in a timely fashion.''

<HEADLINE> One of Two Snagged Whales Freed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- One of two North Atlantic right
whales tangled in fishing gear managed to free itself Friday, while
researchers continued efforts to help the second rare animal
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Tobin, whale emergency network coordinator with East
Coast Ecosystems Research Organizations, said inclement weather in
the Bay of Fundy off eastern Canada made it difficult to approach
the whale that was still tangled in ropes and buoys.
</P>
<P>
   The other whale had been caught in a fishing gill net, but was
able to slip out of it Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tobin, the longer a whale remains tangled in lines
and nets, the greater the chance of infection from cuts and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were lucky with the second whale that it managed to get
itself free,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents have increased concern about the population of
North Atlantic right whales, which number only about 300.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers know of 31 entanglements since 1970, at least three
of which were fatal; eleven others are believed to have contributed
to the death of the whales.

<HEADLINE> Senators Reach Land Bill Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A compromise was reached Friday on legislation
to create a $3 billion annual land conservation trust fund,
clearing the way for the bill's probable approval by a key Senate
committee next week -- although final Senate passage remains
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would provide $45 billion over 15 years for a
broad range of conservation activities from restoration of beaches
and coastal wetlands to setting aside new urban parks and land
purchases by both federal and state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Already approved by the House, the measure has run into strong
opposition in the Senate from a group of western senators who are
concerned it would lead to a rush of land buying by the government.
Other senators maintain it provides an open checkbook for spending
that would not be subject to annual congressional review.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee, and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.,
the committee's ranking Democrat, announced Friday that they had
reached agreement on a compromise that they believed will attract
enough votes next week to get it out of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also supports the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a statement that the legislation, if
it passes Congress, would for the first time ''provide permanent
funding to protect critical lands across America'' and create ''a
truly enduring conservation endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   No action by the full Senate was expected on the measure until
September at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the House-passed bill, the compromise in the Senate would
require that Congress, through the appropriations process, approve
all federal land purchases. The bill calls for spending $450
million in federal land purchases, while providing an equal amount
for states to buy land.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining money in the newly created fund would be spent on
a wide range of conservation programs, but would not be released
only if Congress agrees to spent the full $450 million for the
federal land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's raft is tied together,'' said Bingaman. Congress
over the years has routinely failed to provide full funding of the
Land and Water Conservation Fund, which directs federal land
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has broad appeal in Congress. The House passed
it by a 315-102 vote in May. One reason is that it provides huge
amounts of new federal money for states to use on everything from
restoring wetlands to building bike paths, setting aside parkland
and funding both wildlife protection and game hunting programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from revenue the government gets from oil
and gas leases, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and drilling off
Alaska. At the same time coastal states close to offshore drilling
-- Texas, Louisiana and Alaska -- would fare especially well in the
distribution of more than $800 million annually for coastal
restoration and stewardship programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is sharp opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll face obstacles and our agreement does not guarantee
passage,'' acknowledged Bingaman.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest opposition comes from a half-dozen western
senators concerned about property rights and the spending of
billions of dollars outside the normal congressional process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe we should create an entitlement and say land
acquisition is more important than education or health care,'' said
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who is chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee that has jurisdiction of Interior Department programs.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski acknowledged concerns by some western senators, but
said he believes ''we address their concerns in this bill. ... Land
acquired (under the fund) must be from willing seller and must be
approved by Congress.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Last FEC report confirms Corzine spent record $33 million in primary </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The final report is in: Jon Corzine spent
$33 million, more than $30 million of it his own money, to beat
former Gov. Jim Florio and win the Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever spent that much money in an entire campaign for U.S.
Senate, never mind just a primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's closing report to the Federal Elections Commission is
due Saturday, but was released by his office Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed Corzine's campaign paid out $31 million for TV
commercials, campaign consultants and staff and offices in
virtually every county in the state to cajole voters to the polls.
The report also shows the campaign had accrued another $2 million
in outstanding debts and obligations yet to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine won soundly June 6 with 58 percent of the vote. Florio's
staff said they had expected the outcome to be closer, crediting
Corzine's skill at organizing in advance of primary election day to
ensure a large turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The former Wall Street executive, who has a personal fortune
estimated at more than $400 million, will run in November against
Republican nominee Bob Franks, a congressman representing the Union
County-based 7th District.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has wasted no time criticizing Corzine for his heavy
spending. Corzine defended it as necessary for him as a complete
newcomer to generate adequate name recognition in both the New York
and Philadelphia TV markets, among the nation's costliest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's spending figure confirmed earlier conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   A report filed with the FEC on May 25 showed the Corzine
campaign had spent $25 million as of May 17 with another $2 million
in debts. On May 26, that FEC report was amended with new documents
showing an added total of about $6 million had been pumped into the
campaign war chest, pushing the expected total to $33 million.

<HEADLINE> Auditor Never Told of Judge's Order  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An independent auditor hired to review the
retrieval of White House e-mails told a federal judge on Friday
that he was never informed of the judge's order to produce the
messages promptly.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony from Gregory Ekberg came at the end of a lengthy
pretrial hearing in a civil lawsuit against the White House.
Ekberg, of Vistronix, a McLean, Va., information technology
company, said he had never heard of U.S. District Judge Royce
Lamberth's order, filed last April, to produce the e-mails as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the White House said it hoped to have a system in
place by June.
</P>
<P>
   Ekberg testified earlier Friday that new and reliable equipment,
approved by the FBI on Thursday, is helping the White House
reassemble thousands of missing and once-thought irretrievable
e-mails sought in a lawsuit against the Clinton administration. He
and another White House computer specialist said a searchable
database of the e-mails could be delivered to the judge in four
weeks to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But under direct questioning from Lamberth Friday, Ekberg said
he was never told of any orders to produce the e-mails promptly.
</P>
<P>
   The judge seemed incredulous when Ekberg, whose job is to review
the entire project on an ongoing basis, said the judge's order had
never been discussed. Ekberg said the only deadline he was given
required the e-mails to be copied by the end of 2000 -- and that
came from a subcontractor hired by the White House, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ekberg's exchange with the judge came after several hours on the
witness stand, during which he said workers struggled with three
computer systems that either failed to copy the e-mails from master
tapes or couldn't produce exact copies, as required in the case. He
said a fourth system, approved Thursday by the FBI, is now in use.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived and were lost because of a computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the messages were never reviewed by White House
lawyers to determine if they should be turned over to investigators
under subpoena in cases ranging from the Monica Lewinsky scandal
and Whitewater to campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth is holding the hearings to determine how to get the
messages to investigators. Testimony was expected to continue on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an apparent programming error, incoming e-mail
messages dating back to August 1996 were not searched in response
to subpoenas by the Justice Department and congressional
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, Independent Counsel Robert Ray and the Justice
Department are investigating whether the e-mail problem was an
innocent mistake, as the White House contends, or part of an effort
to obstruct their investigations into the Lewinsky scandal and the
White House's gathering of the FBI files of past Republican
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans say the White House has dragged its feet in
solving the problem and threatened technicians who revealed the
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by the conservative legal group Judicial
Watch. The group's general counsel, Larry Klayman, told Lamberth
that the White House intentionally hired consultants with little
expertise in restoring the data in order to delay the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., urged White House counsel
Beth Nolan and Attorney General Janet Reno to support appointment
of an outside expert to supervise the e-mail effort.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the House Government Reform Committee, which he
heads, ''has no confidence that the White House will satisfy its
obligations to produce information in a timely fashion.''

<HEADLINE> Once forbidden from casinos, Miss America Pageant now embracing them </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Up until three years ago, Miss
America Pageant contestants weren't allowed to be seen in casinos,
even if they were old enough to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant officials didn't want contestants being seen in an
unfavorable light.
</P>
<P>
   But times change: On Friday, the woman who will represent New
Jersey in the 80th annual Miss America Pageant appeared at a
publicity event for a new brand of slot machine at Showboat Casino
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Coin cup in hand, a smiling Jill Horner performed the first
pulls on a Slotto slot machine during a ceremony on the casino
floor. After helping cut a ribbon in front of the 25-cent machines,
Horner tried her luck, winning $5.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just talking to Miss New Jersey, and she's in the same
boat we are,'' said Mac Seelig, president of A.C. Coin &AMP; Slot, the
machine's maker. ''We're both proud of what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, pageant contestants were forbidden from gambling in
the casinos, a policy that annoyed casino officials who provide
free hotel rooms for pageant contestants and traveling companions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the ban was eliminated as part of a push to bring
''America's ideal'' more up to date with current mores. In 1998,
contestants were permitted to wear two-piece suits for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, the pageant approved - and then shelved - a
plan to let women who had had divorces or abortions compete.
</P>
<P>
   Miss America Pageant CEO Robert Renneisen said Friday that
allowing a contestant to promote a gambling device was part of Miss
America's ''social evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a legal business in New Jersey, just like the pageant.
It's my understanding that Showboat made a substantial donation to
the Miss New Jersey Pageant as a quid pro quo for the appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a non-issue, to tell you the truth. A few years ago,
two-piece bathing suits were banned, too. It's a sign of changing
social evolution,'' said Renneisen, a former casino president.
</P>
<P>
   Showboat agreed to make a $10,000 donation to the Miss New
Jersey Pageant in exchange for Horner's appearance, according to
Michael Allegretto, its executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something new. We're not trying to promote gambling or
anything, but we are trying to promote Miss New Jersey. In New
Jersey, we have casinos. If we can work with them a little bit and
they can donate some scholarship money to our program, we look
forward to working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodger Gros, editor of trade magazine Casino Journal, said it
makes sense for the pageant and the casinos to work together more
than they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to change now, with Bob Renneisen in
charge. The pageant is identified with Atlantic City, as are the
casinos. So put them both together,'' Gros said.
</P>
<P>
   Horner, 21, of Gloucester Township, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the hotel and motel association that started the
pageant in the first place. I think they go hand in hand,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry of Colombia Massacre Ordered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Paul Wellstone urged Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Friday to investigate the reported murder or
disappearance of 71 Colombian civilians in February and the killing
of six more this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Albright should see to it that those involved be brought to
justice, said Wellstone, D-MN.
</P>
<P>
   He cited an article Friday's editions of the New York Times
alleging that on Feb. 17, a rightist paramilitary group killed 36
people in El Salado, 16 of whom were executed on the town's
basketball court. Another 18 were killed in the surrounding
countryside and 17 are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The Times story also noted that on July 8, helicopters and
soldiers from the Colombian 17th Army Brigade appear to have
facilitated killings of six men by a paramilitary unit in La Union.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said the continuing reports of human rights abuses in
Colombia ''confirm our grave reservations regarding the
administration's ability to manage the use of resources that will
be provided while protecting the human rights of Colombian
citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Town bans use of hand-held cell phones by drivers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARLBORO, N.J. (AP) - Marlboro Township has become the first
community in New Jersey to prohibit the use of hand-held cellular
phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Township Council voted 4-0 Thursday night in favor of the
ban, only the fifth of its kind in the United States. Mayor Matthew
Scannapieco signed the ordinance a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the public interest to prevent injuries and save
lives, and if I can save just one life with this ordinance, then
I'll have done my job as an elected official,'' council Vice
President Barry Denkensohn said before casting his vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came two days after a Pennsylvania judge struck down a
similar ordinance in Bucks County, ruling that Hilltown Township
did not have the power to pre-empt state motor vehicle laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ban, anyone caught driving with a hand-held cell phone
is subject to a fine of up to $250. Hands-free cell phones are not
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved after 50 minutes of public comment from
residents and motorists on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Golf, 57, of Milltown, spoke about his nephew, 19-year-old
Shawn Kulczycki, who was killed in Old Bridge in September 1998 by
a driver talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death of a loved one hurts deeply. The tragic, senseless,
preventable death of a loved one hurts much more,'' Golf said.
''Even one life is too much to give up for anyone else's pleasure
and convenience. I beg you, please don't wait for a tragedy like
this to hit your home. You won't like it. It hurts real bad and it
don't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who argued against the ban called it a costly endeavor
that will chew through township resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know this is going to be challenged -- why bother?'' asked
Marlboro resident Mark Rosenwald, 51. ''Your hearts are in the
right places, but it's not the purpose of government to protect
everyone from everything in life. If you do that, you might as well
move to a socialist country.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after the council closed the public hearing, but
before it voted, Philip Berg, the Pennsylvania attorney who argued
against the cell phone ban in the Bucks County case, arrived at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Denied a chance to speak, Berg spoke up anyway, and the crowd
cheered him on. Before township police escorted Berg away from the
microphone, he said, ''If you pass this law I will represent anyone
for free and we will appeal it in court.''
</P>
<P>
   No summonses were issued Friday, Scannapieco said. The township
plans to allow for a ''grace period'' before police begin citing
drivers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Township officials will meet Monday to decide how best to get
word out about the change and when to begin enforcing the ban in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not looking to set people up,'' said Scannapieco. He
said he does not expect special patrols to be set up just to catch
gabbing drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Early on in enforcement, it might be a secondary kind of
thing. If we see someone driving erratically and notice that
there's a cell phone, that would be a reason for the stop. Then add
on the cell phone (citation),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union does not
plan to get involved in the debate, executive director Deborah
Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you recognize that driving is a privilege, not a right, you
can see how we won't get involved,'' Jacobs said.

<HEADLINE> Gay Activists Focus on Census Count  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They could have called themselves
''roommates'' or ''boarders.'' Even ''other non-relative'' would
have been appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, on his Census 2000 form, Ronald Nelson checked off the
box next to the words he felt best symbolized his long-standing and
committed relationship with the man he's lived with the last five
years -- ''unmarried partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian rights groups encouraged other couples to do the
same this year, hoping it would provide the most comprehensive
statistical look ever at the size of America's same-sex-couple
population. The first Census Bureau results are scheduled to be
released early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups believe homosexuals should volunteer this
information, which technically can only be inferred from the
responses to the ''unmarried partner'' box on the Census form. The
government does not directly ask people their sexual preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the same way that the government wants to know how many,
say, Samoans, there are in the United States, they need to know
there is a gay and lesbian population,'' said Nelson, who lives in
the nation's capital. ''We don't have little pink triangles near
our names in the telephone book, and this is a way to get some hard
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Because no question on the Census form specifically asks about
sexuality, there is no official count of the number of homosexuals
in America. Approximately 150,000 households included same-sex
unmarried partners in 1990, the first year the Census forms
contained that option, but the total was not officially a part of
that census.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates contend updated numbers could influence
policy decisions at the federal, state and local level.
</P>
<P>
   It might help make the argument for providing Social Security
and survivor benefits to same-sex couples, for instance, or play a
role in three states -- Mississippi, Florida and Utah -- where
adoptions by gay couples have been banned, said Sean Cahill, policy
director for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might mean, from a policy perspective, we go to Health and
Human Services and say, 'You know what, we have to change the rules
on Social Security.' Or it might mean we go to Congress and ask for
tax relief. We won't know for sure until the results come out,''
said Paula Ettelbrick, the task force's family policy director.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an enormous amount of public policy that flows out of
the census,'' said David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay rights group. ''Part of our message was this is a
process you can trust. It is highly confidential and it's used for
statistical purposes only.''
</P>
<P>
   One section on the Census form offers choices for people who are
related, such as ''father'' or ''daughter.'' The ''unmarried
partner'' box is in a section with other choices for people who
live in the same households but are not related.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want gay couples to be counted say that if a gay
person and his or her partner both check off the same sex, and then
check off ''unmarried partner,'' that can be equated to someone
admitting their same-sex relationship. That inference can be drawn,
they say, because the form has other options available to describe
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials say the ''unmarried partner'' category
was added to keep up with the country's changing demographics, but
they stress there are no plans to ask directly about a person's
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are doing in the 2000 Census is coding the unmarried
partners of the same sex living together, so that becomes a
category. That category did not exist in 1990,'' Census Director
Kenneth Prewitt said. ''So that's already a reflection of an
attempt to maintain a Census operation which is somewhat consistent
with the change in social dynamics of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Vermont recently passed a civil unions law expanding
benefits for same-sex couples, the fact that Congress and at least
30 states have passed laws denying recognition to such
''marriages'' may have made some couples uncomfortable about
checking off the ''unmarried partner'' box.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of gays and lesbians are a little hesitant to do that,
or think it's not important because they are not allowed to get
married,'' said Ron Lewis of Silver Spring, Md.

<HEADLINE> Sports Authority to pay Francis' legal bills of $463,862  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The state's failed prosecution of the former
head of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and Gov.
Christie Whitman's former chief fund-raiser has cost taxpayers
nearly a half-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The authority will pay Michael Francis $463,862 to cover legal
fees he incurred defending himself against corruption charges
involving the alleged shakedown of an Atlantic City shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
   A judge threw out 10 counts of a 12-count indictment, finding
the state's case was too weak. The state attorney general's office
dropped the other two counts in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that this goes some of the distance toward
making up for the devastating period of time Michael had to spend
while this was pending,'' said his attorney, Michael Chertoff.
''You can't repay someone for the personal toll it takes on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis had been accused of trying to force an Atlantic City
shopping center to hire his cleaning business while he was the head
of the sports authority.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors had said Francis, the head fund-raiser for
Whitman's successful 1993 gubernatorial campaign, threatened the
Ocean One Mall with labor unrest if it did not award his Planned
Building Services a $500,000 cleaning contract.
</P>
<P>
   The defense said there was no evidence that Francis did anything
other than promote his company. His statements that there would be
no labor problems were meant to reassure the mall owners, not
threaten or pressure them, the defense said.
</P>
<P>
   Francis requested the sports authority to reimburse him for his
legal bills. After consulting with their lawyers, the authority's
commissioners approved a settlement June 2, and it was executed
July 10, spokesman Daniel Emmer said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 24, Nasdaq Rises 71  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors brushed aside a landmark ruling
against the tobacco industry Friday, pushing stock prices higher
after new government data showed inflationary pressures remain
under control.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 24.04 at 10,812.75.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks fell into negative territory late in the
session after a Florida jury ordered the cigarette industry to pay
a record $145 billion in damages to Florida smokers. But the Dow
Jones index ended higher after a late wave of buying.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 71.32 at 4,246.18 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 14.14 at 1,509.98.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was down as many investors stayed on the
sidelines ahead a slew of second-quarter earnings reports expected
next week. Friday's market focused mainly on three new reports that
provided more evidence of a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers,
rose 0.6 percent in June. While that gain was bigger than expected,
it mostly was due to a sharp rise in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which
doesn't include energy or food costs, fell an unexpected 0.1
percent in June, the best showing since January.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, retail sales rose by a slightly
bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent in June, but excluding the
volatile automobile category, sales rose just 0.2 percent, weaker
than expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a third report, industrial production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose an expected 0.2 percent in
June, the slowest pace since September.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports showed that the Federal Reserve's six
interest-rate hikes over the past year were cooling off the
economy's pace and keeping inflation under control. That helped
ease investors' fears that the Fed will raise rates again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earnings are fine, inflation is fine, the world is in good
shape, but people are still a little nervous about the stock
market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''We had a very tough spring
and that forced many people to be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks were down modestly across the board. Philip
Morris was down 31.25 cents to $24.688. RJ Reynolds closed down
93.75 cents to $26.188. And Loews Corp., parent of Lorillard
Tobacco, was down 43.75 cents to $63.063.
</P>
<P>
   But the positive economic news helped push banking and financial
stocks higher. J.P. Morgan, which reported strong earnings on
Thursday, gained $4.563 to $128.688, while Citigroup rose $1.375 to
$68.
</P>
<P>
   Merck came under some selling pressure, falling $1.875 to
$67.188 after a federal advisory panel told the Food and Drug
Administration that the company's Mevacor is a safe and effective
treatment to reduce high cholesterol, but it shouldn't be sold
without a prescription.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox May Marry  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City was abuzz Friday over reports
that Vicente Fox, president-elect and the country's most eligible
bachelor, was planning to tie the knot -- with his media director.
</P>
<P>
   The daily newspaper El Economista cited ''sources close to both
of them'' as saying that Fox, who won the July 2 elections, had
gone to a Caribbean island with his children last weekend to tell
them he planned to marry his spokeswoman, Martha Sahagun.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the wedding would be in September, before
Fox's Dec. 1 inaugural. Fox, 58, and Sahagun, 48, are both
divorced. Fox has four children; Sahagun has three.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox's daughter Ana Cristina, who has said she will act as
his first lady and who has never kept her dislike of Sahagun
private, denied the reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She said that at the family getaway last weekend, Fox told his
four children: ''I've decided to stay as I am now. I'm happy this
way, and I plan to stay this way for a long while.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Martha works with my father,'' Ana Cristina Fox told
reporters. ''We aren't friends and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox spokeswoman Gina Morris said the report was ''totally false,
pure rumors, it's all just speculation.'' Neither Fox nor Sahagun
commented.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of Mexico City, the reports were the best
gossip in ages. Shoe-shiners and their clients traded opinions on
Sahagun's attributes, comparing them with those of actress Lucia
Mendez, whom the news media also has linked romantically to Fox.
Young women were disappointed that Fox might cease to be a
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not jealous, but I really like Fox,'' said Paty Salazar, a
20-year-old telemarketer. ''It would be a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Robles, a 40-year-old policeman guarding a bank, said it
would be a load off his chest if Fox got married.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the women are jumping all over him now,'' Antonio Robles,
a policeman, said. ''Even my old lady wants to be first lady.''

<HEADLINE> Episcopalians Move Forward on Gays  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Episcopalians moved toward accepting same-sex
couples this week by acknowledging their presence in the church,
but they signaled they are not ready to sanction their
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the 10-day Episcopal General Convention that ended
Friday overwhelmingly declared that the church should support
unmarried couples -- homosexual and heterosexual -- in monogamous
relationships honoring religious values.
</P>
<P>
   The step was not as big as gay and lesbian advocates wanted.
Conservative Episcopalians thought it was a move in the wrong
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It moves us significantly forward on the issue of full
inclusion,'' said the Rev. Susan Russell of Los Angeles, a member
of Integrity, a gay and lesbian advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Some Episcopal congregations bless same-sex unions without
churchwide sanction and ordain homosexual priests. There was
speculation that the church might codify those practices, but a
resolution to do so was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Episcopalians who belong to the conservative group called the
American Anglican Council, which believes homosexuality violates
biblical and church teachings, said in a statement: ''It is sadly
evident to us that two strikingly different churches exist under
the same roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, made up of bishops, priests and clergy, has said
faith can help homosexuals change their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''This church is a mess. We're divided. We're confused. We're
not giving a clear message to anybody,'' said the Rev. Martyn Minns
of Fairfax, Va., a council member.
</P>
<P>
   The clergy and lay members of the House of Deputies, one chamber
of the church's two-chamber legislature, narrowly defeated a plan
to develop ceremonial rites for unmarried couples. The House of
Bishops rejected the measure by a larger margin, saying the church
should move slowly to avoid alienating members.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a committee of church and outside experts will study
the theological basis for blessing same-sex unions and report to
the next convention in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is positive. This is good and healthy,'' said Bishop
Clifton Daniel of eastern North Carolina. ''We go away not of one
mind, but we are not divided.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution recognizing unmarried couples is aimed at those
who cannot marry or, in the case of elderly couples, who do not wed
because of financial circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But some bishops fear it will encourage heterosexual couples to
live out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   ''It says that everything we expect of matrimony can be found
outside of marriage,'' said Gordon Charlton, the retired bishop of
Texas. ''This in effect makes matrimony an option for Christian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Catherine Roskam of New York disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll look at lifelong relationships,'' she said. ''That will
keep it from being trivialized.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gays briefly shut down work in the House of
Deputies when a delegate put salt, a symbolic weapon against the
devil, under the tables of homosexual delegates and their
supporters. Delegates prayed and sang hymns after it was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Episcopalians took a big step forward in Christian unity by
approving an alliance with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America. The partnership follows 40 years of talks and takes effect
Jan. 1, allowing the two churches to share sacraments, clergy and
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates called on the Boy Scouts to accept gay members and
leaders. The resolution was a response to a Supreme Court ruling in
June saying the scouts can bar gay troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Episcopalians also voted to monitor dioceses in the San Joaquin,
Calif., area, in Quincy, Ill., and in Fort Worth, Texas, which are
accused of violating a 1976 church law opening the priesthood to
women.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to bring them into compliance are due by Sept. 1, 2002. No
penalties were recommended.

<HEADLINE> Election Report: Corzine Spent $33M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The final report is in: Jon Corzine spent a
record $33 million, including more than $30 million of his own
money, to beat former Gov. Jim Florio and win New Jersey's
Democratic nomination for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever spent that much in an entire campaign for
Senate, let alone a primary.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's final report to the Federal Election Commission,
released Friday, showed that his campaign paid $31 million for TV
commercials, consultants, and staff and offices in virtually every
county in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine won the primary June 6 with 58 percent of the vote. The
former Wall Street executive, who has a fortune estimated at more
than $400 million, will run in November against Republican Rep. Bob
Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has wasted no time criticizing Corzine's heavy spending.
Corzine defended it as necessary for him as a newcomer to build
name recognition in the New York and Philadelphia TV markets, among
the nation's costliest.

<HEADLINE> Last hurdle being crossed for battleship to be turned over to new owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - After two years of planning, there is only
one detail left to transfer ownership of the USS New Jersey from
the U.S. Navy to the group that will restore the historic warship
and convert it into a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy Secretary Richard Danzig must sign the contract. He is
expected to do that Monday, Thomas Seigenthaler, executive director
of the Home Port Alliance, the group that will renovate the ship,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which already has been signed by officials from
the Home Port Alliance, has been delivered to the Navy Sea Systems
Command headquarters in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Seigenthaler said officials from the Environmental Protection
Agency in Washington, D.C., on Friday signed an agreement for
remediation of hazardous materials on the ship. Officials from the
regional EPA headquarters still need to sign the agreement. Those
documents are among the materials requiring Navy approval.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig also must approve of the plans for towing the 887-foot
ship from the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to the vessel's
temporary home at Pier 4 of the Beckett Street Terminal here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole package should be turned over to the Secretary of
the Navy Monday about noon,'' Seigenthaler said.
</P>
<P>
   Seigenthaler said the ship will probably be towed on July 27 at
about 11 a.m., when the tide will be high in the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Southern New Jersey legislators had hoped the battleship could
be towed during the Republican National Convention, which will be
held in Philadelphia from July 30 through Aug. 3, but Seigenthaler
said that won't be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like July 27 sets it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's final destination will be the waterfront behind the
E-Centre. Seigenthaler said he hopes the vessel can be open to the
public by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to have the ship and pier open for the Fourth of
July so we could all stand out there and watch the fireworks,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Suspected cocaine smuggler from Colombia appears in court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A suspected cocaine smuggler extradited from
Colombia to the United States appeared in federal court Friday to
answer drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Garcia-Cleves arrived in New Jersey on Thursday on a
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane from Bogota, Colombia,
to face charges he smuggled 561 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia
to Newark in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old is the second person Colombian President Andres
Pastrana has allowed to be extradited to stand trial abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking improved ties with Washington, Pastrana has resumed
extraditions from Colombia after a decade-long hiatus. A heroin
suspect Pastrana sent to the United States in November was the
first Colombian extradited since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Cleves appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald J.
Hedges, telling him through a Spanish interpreter that he didn't
have the funds to represent himself. Hedges scheduled a bail
hearing for Garcia-Cleves in Newark on Wednesday and an arraignment
in Trenton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Cleves was arrested in February 1999 along with 18
alleged members of a smuggling ring dubbed ''Los Niches'' that
shipped out the cocaine through the western port of Buenaventura.
</P>
<P>
   An affidavit filed in New Jersey to support the government's
request for extradition said that Garcia-Cleves, who called himself
''Sergio'' in conversations with alleged accomplices, planned the
September 1998 shipment of 445 kilograms of cocaine to Port Newark,
and the November 1998 shipment of 116 kilograms of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The government has recorded telephone conversations between a
cooperating witness and Garcia-Cleves about the arrangements, the
affidavit said. When he was arrested at his Cali, Colombia, home in
February 1999, authorities found cellular telephone bills, shipping
documents and a black organizer with telephone numbers of his
alleged accomplices, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian authorities seized the 445 kilograms of cocaine in
boxes of plastic tables and chairs from the Buenos Aires vessel in
Colombia on Sept. 26, 1998, the affidavit said. The shipment was
bound for the Northeast Trading Corporation in Newark, which the
affidavit said was a false company created to facilitate the
shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents in Newark seized the 116 kilograms of cocaine
inside the MSC Bogota on Nov. 25, 1998. Three people were arrested
trying to pick up the cocaine at a rented warehouse in Newark,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Those three were among seven charged in a November 1998
indictment and all have either been convicted or pleaded guilty and
await sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of all charges, Garcia could face 10 years to life
in prison and a $4 million fine.

<HEADLINE> Public gives lukewarm response to Giuliani tomes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two unauthorized biographies about Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani hit bookstores this week but the public appeared
uninterested so far in the salacious details contained in the
books.
</P>
<P>
   Village Voice reporter Wayne Barrett's book, ''Rudy! An
Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' went on sale Tuesday
while New York 1 News political reporter Andrew Kirtzman's ''Rudy
Giuliani: Emperor of the City,'' appeared in stores beginning
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman said his book hadn't been in stores long enough to
accurately gauge reader interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Corner Book Store on Madison Avenue at 93rd Street was only
stocking the Barrett book, which among other tidbits said the
law-and-order mayor's father, Harold, spent 18 months in prison for
robbing a milkman at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not exactly flying out of the store,'' said Vikki Leffel,
a book store employee. Since Giuliani left the U.S. Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, ''I think people are less
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Williams, a spokeswoman for the city's nine Barnes and
Noble stores, said, ''It's really too soon to say. They just landed
in stores. We won't have a clear sense of how they're selling for
at least a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani dropped out of the race in April after announcing he
had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman's book chronicles Giuliani's rise from prosecutor to
power broker and includes chapters on the mayor's relationship with
former communications director Cristyne Lategano.

   ''My book just came out yesterday,'' Kirtzman said Friday. ''It
is idiotic to try to make any assessment about a book that hasn't
even hit most bookstores yet. The longest the book this book has
been in any bookstore in New York City is 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Borders on Second Avenue near 32nd Street, eight Barrett
books had sold and none of Kirtzman's, said a store clerk who
declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to information about the mayor's father, Barrett
said Giuliani's deceased cousin, Lewis D'Avanzo, was a mob
associate who ran a car theft ring and that Giuliani's father and
uncle also had ties to the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman at William &AMP; Morrow, which published Kirtzman's book
and Basic Books, Barrett's publisher, said it was too early to
comment on sales.
</P>
<P>
   The books appeared to be selling slightly better on the
Internet. Amazon.com listed Barrett's book as 356 in sales overall
and the No. 6 six best seller in New York City. The Kirtzman book
was ranked 815th overall. There was no city ranking.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Tries To Force FBI on E-mail  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using the Freedom of Information Act, the
American Civil Liberties Union is trying to force the FBI to
disclose details of the inner workings of its Carnivore system that
can snoop on e-mails, officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore is a computer-like box that can be hooked up to the
network at an Internet provider. Using special software, it scans
all incoming and outgoing e-mails, capturing those of specific
individuals under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI recently disclosed it has been using the tool to obtain
e-mails of investigative subjects -- but only after getting a search
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberty and privacy advocates have raised concerns about
the tool, in part because its software scans the header information
of all incoming and outgoing e-mails at the provider -- regardless
of whether someone is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Steven Berry said the device gives the agency ''a
surgical ability to intercept and collect the communications which
are the subject of a court order'' and ignores everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Others have raised concerns because Internet providers haven't
been told exactly how the box works.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink, a major Internet provider, disclosed Friday that the
FBI's use of the tool caused service outages for some of its
customers in March. The company has now struck an agreement with
the bureau to prevent future use of the box on its network.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't privy to looking at the specs or any of the
technical details of it,'' EarthLink spokesman Kurt Rahn said. ''If
we couldn't look at how it was set up, and we couldn't know what
information it was gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU is using a novel approach to try to force the FBI to
divulge the inner workings of the system.
</P>
<P>
   It filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act, usually
reserved for public requests for official government documents, for
correspondence, programming code, technical manuals and
specifications of Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carnivore is such an outlandish concept, so there's some
reason to hope that we can put it to rest,'' said ACLU Associate
Director Barry Steinhardt, who made the request.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials declined comment Friday on the ACLU request.
</P>
<P>
   A FOIA expert said the civil liberties group has a tough road
ahead, citing several exemptions to FOIA that the FBI may use to
keep from revealing Carnivore's code.
</P>
<P>
   One exemption has been used to protect information that someone
may use to break the law, said Harry Hammitt, who writes Access
Reports, a newsletter on FOIA issues. Another exemption protects
investigative methods and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   And if a third party, like a private security company, wrote the
Carnivore code for the FBI, the company could use a FOIA exemption
to protect their trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think any of these exemptions provide a pretty solid case
for the government to hold the information about the source code,''
Hammitt said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that the ACLU shouldn't try, Hammitt added. A
FOIA request is inexpensive and may yield lots of other
information, like notes and letters about Carnivore, which may
prove useful.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, a House committee plans to look into the
matter. Also, both Attorney General Janet Reno and House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, expressed concerns about Carnivore.
Reno said the Department of Justice would review the system.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink, an Atlanta-based company with about 4.2 million
subscribers nationwide, said it had installed the snooping software
for the FBI at a data center in Pasadena, Calif., earlier this year
after it lost a decision on the matter in federal court. The device
caused service outages.
</P>
<P>
   Rahn said that while the outages were a ''big deal,'' their main
problem is the privacy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's really been what has gotten us opposed to this in the
first place, and prompted the court case. That's our main
concern,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> What's Next in the Waco Trial  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An advisory jury decided Friday that the government
bears no
responsibility for the deaths of 80 Branch Davidians during the
cult's 1993 standoff with federal agents.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's next:
</P>
<P>
   -- U.S. District Judge Walter Smith still must hear evidence on
what has been the most contentious issue: whether federal agents
shot at the Davidians at the end of the siege. Smith said he wants
to take up the issue Aug. 2 and will make his final ruling on all
the points in the case later.
</P>
<P>
   -- Special Counsel John Danforth still must complete his
independent investigation into the standoff and fire. Danforth was
appointed in September by Attorney General Janet Reno. A
spokeswoman for Danforth would not speculate on when Danforth might
conclude his probe.
</P>
<P>
   -- Five Davidians convicted of manslaughter in 1994 will go
before Smith for resentencing. The Supreme Court in June set aside
the lengthy prison sentences Smith gave them. The court ruled he
misused an anti-gun law to increase their punishment.

<HEADLINE> June Was Warmer Than Normal  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warmth was bustin' out all over in June, but
while last month was hotter than normal it didn't reach record
levels, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually warm weather earlier in the year, however, helped the
nation stay at record levels for the first six months of the year,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On a global basis as well, June temperatures were above the long
term mean, ranking the month as the tenth warmest since 1880.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that the recent string of warm years are
the result of global warming caused by the release of carbon
dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. Others, however, point
to the El Nino-La Nina phenomena affecting Pacific Ocean
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   While NOAA's National Climate Data Center was releasing its
climate data, its sister agency, the National Weather Service,
updated its long-range summer forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The forecast for the coming summer months continues to call
for hotter, drier conditions in many parts of the United States,''
the Weather Service said, noting that much of the Southeast
continues to suffer from severe drought conditions. Some relief is
possible late in the summer if the expected increase in tropical
storms occurs.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, increased monsoon conditions should make the
Southwest wetter than normal this summer, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is lucky to have not yet experienced a major,
widespread heat wave, said David Unger, a meteorologist at NOAA's
Climate Prediction Center.
</P>
<P>
   In localized hot spells, San Francisco had an episode in June
that claimed 22 lives and a recent heat spell in the South has been
blamed for four deaths in Houston and one in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The average June temperature across the United States was 70.0
degrees Fahrenheit, compared to a normal June average of 69.3. The
hottest June on record occurred in 1933 with a national average
temperature of 72.4.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, it was the 33rd warmest June since record
keeping began in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   For January through June the national average was a record 51.6
degrees, well above the 48.4 degree normal.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a regional rundown of June's temperature readings across
the United States, including the normal for the month and the
record high for June:
</P>
<P>
   -- Northeast: 64.8 in June, 64.4 normal, record high 68.6 in
1943. Includes New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Maryland and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   -- East North Central: 64.0 in June, 65.3 normal, 72.4 record in
1933. Includes Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   -- Central: 71.0 in June, 71.3 record, 77.6 record in 1952.
Includes Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   -- Southeast: 77.1 in June, 75.8 normal, 80.8 record in 1952.
Includes Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia
and Florida.
</P>
<P>

1988. Includes Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   -- South: 77.0 in June, 77.6 normal, 83.8 record in 1953.
Includes Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   -- Southwest: 69.8 in June, 68.1 normal, 72.8 record in 1994.
Includes Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pa. Police Chief Vows Beating Probe  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The city's police chief vowed Friday there
will be no rush to judgment in determining whether officers who
beat a carjacking suspect acted properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are prescribed ways of doing this. I know this is very
frustrating and isn't satisfactory, but that's the way it is,''
Police Commissioner John Timoney told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney and Mayor John F. Street have promised a thorough
investigation into Wednesday's videotaped beating of Thomas Jones,
and the Justice Department opened a separate inquiry into whether
Jones' civil rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said authorities have not determined which gun was used
to shoot Police Officer Michael Livewell as he tried to prevent
Jones from stealing a police cruiser. Livewell, who was shot in the
thumb, was released from the hospital Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, it looks like he was shot by the suspect. But it
may change,'' depending on what witnesses say, Timoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Street briefed business leaders and City Council
members on the situation Friday morning, and planned further
briefings with black clergy and state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor declined to comment, but his chief of staff, Stephanie
Franklin-Suber, told KYW-AM that the investigation will be fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not going to be a witch hunt, but there's not going to
be a whitewash,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia NAACP President J. Whyatt Mondesire said the group
was pressing for criminal charges against the officers and would
help the Jones' family sue the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guarantee, they will pay,'' Mondesire said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 30, was hospitalized in fair condition Friday with two
gunshot wounds to the stomach and three to the left arm, said his
mother, Clemeline Jones. She said he woke up and spoke Thursday
morning but has been under heavy sedation since.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they began chasing Jones on Wednesday after spotting
him driving a car that had been taken in a carjacking July 1.
Police said the car crashed, they exchanged gunfire with Jones, and
he then stole the police car and fled before he was cornered and
subdued. Police said Jones shot Livewell in the thumb and bit
another officer's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Philadelphia was selected to be the host of the
Republican National Convention more than 18 months ago, civic
leaders have been giddy over the chance to promote the city as an
exciting, renewed urban center.
</P>
<P>
   But less than three weeks before the start of the convention,
millions of television viewers saw a more disturbing image of
Philadelphia: police officers kicking and punching Jones over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the kind of image that Philadelphia wants on the
eve of the Republican convention,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a
political analyst at Millersville University.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the city's black community called it a case of police
brutality, but said the beating did not appear to be racially
motivated. Several black officers took part.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that the black community of Philadelphia will
remain calm,'' said the Rev. Vernal Simms, president of the Black
Clergy of Philadelphia &AMP; Vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said police do not receive training in when to kick and
when not to kick, but under certain circumstances it is
permissible.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you feel you're in a life-and-death situation, clearly you
do whatever you have to do to survive. Is that the situation here
now? We have no idea,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney noted the video shows only an aerial view of the beating
and does not indicate whether Jones was resisting.
</P>
<P>
   A frame-by-frame analysis of the video by The Philadelphia
Inquirer showed Jones was punched and kicked 59 times in 28 seconds
before a supervisor rushed in and backed the officers away. Most of
the blows, 41, were inflicted by just three officers, two of them
plainclothes officers, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Have Record Cash on Hand  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee raised
almost as much money in June as the Democrats did during the
previous three months, and have millions more in the bank in
preparation for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC reported Friday that it raised $36 million last month,
just $1 million less than the Democratic National Committee took in
from April 1 to June 30. The Republicans had $53 million in the
bank as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats had plenty of money as well, reporting $35
million in the bank, the biggest balance in party history. With $2
million in bills still unpaid, the party has almost $33 million to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to need every last penny to be able to combat the
slash-and-burn negative campaign of the Democrats and their liberal
allies,'' RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are armed and ready to fight the Republicans in the fall
and restore true leadership to this Congress,'' DNC National
Chairman Joe Andrew said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Between Jan. 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, the RNC has raised more
than $140 million to the Democrats' $108 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties set fund-raising marks earlier this year. In April,
the RNC took in $21.5 million at a dinner headlined by presumptive
GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That record was broken May 24, when the Democratic party
faithful filled jammed a downtown Washington arena and listened to
Stevie Wonder, Lenny Kravitz and Robin Williams. The Democrats
charged up to $500,000 for the concert/barbecue dinner, twice as
much as the top ticket at any previous fund-raiser for either
party. The event, billed as a salute to President Clinton, raised
$26.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the White House and both houses of Congress are
up for grabs, Democrats have been able to compete financially with
the GOP. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for
example, reported $37 million in the bank as of July 1, as compared
with $22 million for the National Republican Congressional
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   DNC General Chairman Edward Rendell said the party's financial
success bodes well for November.
</P>
<P>
   ''The success of this year's fund-raising efforts represents the
faith of the American people in the Democratic Party, its ability
to maintain our nation's current prosperity and voters'
dissatisfaction with the Republican-led do-nothing Congress,''
Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their financial prowess will help them win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our fund-raising success is a sign of the tremendous
enthusiasm for a Republican victory from coast to coast, and it
will enable us to continue taking our message to the American
people,'' said Fred Meyer, chairman of Victory 2000, the party's
coordinated effort with the Bush campaign.

Tobacco Cos. Ordered To Pay $145B
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- After a two-year trial, a jury took less than five hours today
to decide that the tobacco industry should pay a record-shattering $145 billion
in punitive damages to sick Florida smokers -- an amount industry lawyers
predicted would break the industry. Stock prices of the five companies were down
moderately following the ruling. The companies plan to appeal, and the verdict
will likely be tied up in the appeals process for years and is not expected to
have any immediate impact on the industry.

verdict. The five jurors deliberated for 2&AMP;frac12; hours in the $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of
those who were killed. The trial, which lasted nearly a month, brought out
emotional testimony recounting the standoff from both sides.U.S. District Judge
Walter Smith, who will take the jury's findings under advisement, said he would

revealed Bakaly told him about a straw vote by prosecutors on whether to indict
the president. Agents Thomas Lewis and Michael Erbach were among the
investigators searching for the anonymous ''associates'' of then-Independent

<HEADLINE> Eritrean Refugees To Go Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Some 90,000 Eritreans who took refuge in
Sudan during their country's war with neighboring Ethiopia will be
begin returning home under an agreement reached Friday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement among the United Nations, Sudan and Eritrea would
permit the return of refugees living in three camps for more than
two months after being forced to flee their shops and farms by
fighting in the 2-year war between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kessler, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees'
spokesman in Eritrea, said the first organized transport to return
the refugees would be provided next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means everybody can come back with their personal affects
as soon as they wish,'' Kessler told The Associated Press. ''It's a
sign people are betting on stability, the cease-fire agreement and
the quick deployment of peacekeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cessation of
hostilities agreement and agreed to the deployment of a U.N. force
to secure a 15-mile buffer zone inside Eritrea while independent
experts conduct the demarcation of their disputed 620-mile border.

   A U.N. reconnaissance mission laying the groundwork for the
force is currently in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Last
week, the team, headed by Australian Maj. Gen. Timothy Ford, spent
three days in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have been locked in a border conflict since May
6, 1998, with sporadic fighting costing the impoverished nations
tens of thousands of lives and millions of dollars in armaments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Africa's longest-suffering refugees, 160,000
Eritreans who fled to Sudan at the start of their country's war of
independence 30 years ago, will have to wait a bit longer before
they can return.
</P>
<P>
   A repatriation program was supposed to have begun in May for
these refugees, also in Sudan, but it was put on hold by fighting
in the latest conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be several months before they are repatriated,
Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Ag. Dept.: Sheep Must Be Destroyed  </HEADLINE>
By WILSON RING
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST WARREN, Vt. (AP) -- The Agriculture Department on Friday
ordered 376 imported sheep to be destroyed after tests showed they
might be infected with a sheep equivalent of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of four slaughtered sheep found evidence of a version of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the scientific name for the
always-fatal mad cow disease, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The tests mean the animals could have had the same disease that
killed 53 people and devastated the beef industry in Great Britain
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the remotest possibility that it could be that, I think
that we have to take all precautions,'' said Linda Detwiler, the
department's senior staff veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman signed an order Friday to
destroy two flocks of sheep in Greensboro and East Warren. The
owners of a smaller flock in Lyndonville agreed to sell their 21
sheep to the government for destruction.
</P>
<P>
   More tests will be done to see if the sheep had the disease or
another less-serious ailment, but the results will not be available
for several years, Detwiler said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep, which have been quarantined since 1998, came from an
area of Belgium where mad cow disease was found. They are the only
such flock in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said sheep have not gotten mad cow disease anywhere in
the world, but acknowledged that scientists have been able to
infect sheep with the disease in laboratories.

<HEADLINE> Governor defends police actions when photo was taken  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman Friday denied charges
that state troopers and Camden police were rounding up anyone who
happened to be on city streets the night she toured high-crime
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't stopping every minority that they saw. They
weren't patting down every minority that they saw,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said what she did see that night in 1996 when she
was photographed searching a suspect was good police work that
needs no apology.
</P>
<P>
   But a black state Assemblyman said he will meet organizers of a
South Carolina tourism boycott to plan a similar protest here
unless Whitman apologizes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's refusal to apologize for the pat-down incident
is tantamount to the behavior of South Carolina officials who had
refused to stop flying the Confederate flag,'' William Payne,
D-Essex, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''That photograph is just as inexcusable as flying that flag,''
Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the photograph of the governor and the suspect
became widely public, Whitman continued to defend her search as
well as the police officers that accompanied her.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had been racially profiling, the people in Camden
would have yelled about it at the time,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were exercising good police judgment and good solid law
enforcement work and they were driving down crime. And you can do
that even if it ends up that you're arresting minorities,'' Whitman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, whose administration has been dogged by accusations of
insensitivity to minorities, has rejected any attempt to associate
the pat-down search and the 4-year-old photograph with the practice
of racial profiling, in which police target suspects based on race.
</P>
<P>
   During the governor's visit to Camden, state troopers offered
Whitman the chance to search a suspect. Whitman said she accepted
because she felt it was her duty to experience all areas of police
work.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has repeatedly refused to issue a blanket apology for
the picture and the pat-down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were trying to fight crime. Do innocent people sometimes
get stopped and frisked? Yes, clearly that happens because they
didn't arrest everybody that they stopped and patted down,''
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was that racial profiling? No, it was part of a0 very intense
time to try to drive back and drive down crime in a city that was
under siege,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the man she patted down eventually comes forward, Whitman
said she is unsure if she needs to apologize to him. Her search
came during a regular police encounter, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know that he knew there was a break in the
pat-down,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has said that the man was first searched by
officers to ensure he carried no weapons. It is still unclear if
police kept any records of his name or the cause for the initial
search.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported Friday that the man in the
photograph is Sherron Rolax, who was 17 at the time. Rolax refused
to comment, but an uncle, Anthony English, said his nephew told him
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Rolax, who was not arrested that night, is now in the
Mountainview Youth Correctional Facility on 1998 drug charges, the
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana ID Cards Issued  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- With $25 and a doctor's note, sick people
can get an official city ID card entitling them to use marijuana,
the city's maverick district attorney proudly announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The program shields card-holders caught with the drug from local
prosecution -- though marijuana possession remains illegal under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ''This represents another stone in the foundation we're building
to make people recognize that cannabis is a legitimate medicinal
agent,'' said District Attorney Terence Hallinan. ''I'm not really
worried we won't be able to work things out with the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Californians voted to legalize marijuana for medical use in
1996, but the ballot measure they approved has been entangled in
legal disputes ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of National Drug Control Policy has long opposed
medical marijuana initiatives, considering them backdoor routes to
legalizing marijuana. Agency officials refused to comment on San
Francisco's new ID program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to California, measures approving the medical use of
marijuana have passed in Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada,
Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   While federal opposition to marijuana remains strong, there are
signs that government arguments against states' medicinal marijuana
measures may be weakening.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge on Friday hinted he may be forced to allow an
Oakland club to distribute medicinal marijuana because the Justice
Department hasn't rebutted evidence that cannabis is the only
effective treatment for a large group of seriously ill people.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer of San Francisco said he
would rule Monday in the complex case, which draws in the wider
conflict between California's medical marijuana initiative and
federal drug regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Weirick, who uses marijuana to alleviate pain from a back
ailment, said the city's ID cards will ''finally give us
legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was taking prescription opiates and was stuck in bed all the
time,'' she said. ''When I started taking cannabis, I was finally
able to function. It was like night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   Former state Attorney General Dan Lungren opposed any attempt to
carry out the 1996 ballot measure and shut down most of the state's
informal marijuana distribution clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But since Bill Lockyer took over as attorney general last year,
the state's position has shifted toward support for the creation of
a statewide marijuana ID program.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Proposition 215 passed, many prosecutors said they
wouldn't enforce it,'' said San Francisco Department of Public
Health Director Mitch Katz. ''But things are different in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor, Hallinan, who describes himself as ''America's
most progressive district attorney,'' has refused to carry out the
government's War on Drugs, choosing instead to send minor drug
offenders to diversion programs.
</P>
<P>
   His stance on marijuana is shared by a growing number of law
enforcement officials elsewhere in Northern California, where
attitudes toward marijuana have a decidedly mellow tone. Similar
marijuana ID programs already are in use in Mendocino County and
Arcata.
</P>
<P>
   To get the card in San Francisco, a doctor must sign a form
agreeing to monitor the patient's medical condition. The cards are
good for up to two years, and minors can get them too with approval
from a parent or guardian. The program doesn't address how
card-holders will obtain the drug. It merely shields them from
prosecution -- and then only local prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have described it as an efficient way to
distinguish medical users from recreational ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wonderful civics lesson that could only occur in a
place like San Francisco,'' said Police Department Assistant Chief
Prentice Sanders. ''We find that this is an orderly way to carry
out the law and the will of the people.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Questioned in Fast Food Slayings  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP LATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) -- Police questioned four people Friday in the
shooting deaths of workers at a Captain D's restaurant and then
released them, saying they didn't know much.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip, police located a car at a truck stop north of
Smyrna and took in four people for questioning, but
''unfortunately, their information was not that helpful to
investigators,'' police Sgt. Scott Byers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interviews were completed and no charges were filed. No
one is in custody,'' Byers said. He said the four cooperated fully.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any suspects named at this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the three employees were found early Wednesday.
Manager trainee Scott Myers, 42, assistant manager Bryan Speight,
29, and employee Troy Snell, 18, were each shot once in the head,
state medical examiner Bruce Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators initially said robbery was the apparent motive,
but now they are considering other possible motives, Byers said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Snell's body was discovered first, slumped over in the driver's
seat of his car parked behind a discount store, a quarter-mile away
from the Captain D's. Police said there was no sign of struggle and
no bullet holes in the car or windows, indicating Snell likely was
not fleeing the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Indications that Snell worked at the seafood restaurant led
police there, where they found the bodies of Speight and Myers in a
cooler.
</P>
<P>
   The department received about 100 calls from people offering
information, and security videotapes from nearby businesses also
helped authorities develop a list of possible suspects, Byers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville-based Shoney's Inc., the parent company of Captain
D's, has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of the killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   The Smyrna Captain D's was a training site for managers
throughout the country, the company said. Myers, who lived near
Memphis with his wife and three daughters, was completing his last
night of training when he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he had come home one day earlier, he would have been home
with me at the time they came to tell me what had happened,'' said
his widow, Julie, breaking into sobs. ''This is all so hard.''

<HEADLINE> Pipeline protesters won't give up, looking at appeal  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Homeowners and farmers fighting a plan to build a natural gas
pipeline across northern Ohio into Pennsylvania expect to appeal
federal approval of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   There also is talk landowners may file lawsuits to halt the
pipeline, which would begin in Defiance and span 400 miles through
18 counties in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though on the surface it appears discouraging, this is
not discouraging,'' Wood County Commissioner Tim Brown said of
Wednesday's decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
''This is not the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A partnership of natural gas sellers wants to build the
Independence Pipeline to move gas from Chicago to New York. A
second stretch of pipeline would extend 90 miles through parts of
10 New Jersey counties.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are worried the pipeline will come close to their
homes and that it would disrupt costly drainage systems in northern
Ohio's farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   Wood County produces the most corn, soybean and wheat in the
state. Its fields have elaborate drainage systems to keep them from
reverting to their natural marshy condition.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said lawyers are looking into whether the pipeline
operators met a requirement to have signed contracts for at least
35 percent of their proposed capacity for service by shippers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted in December to deny permission for the
pipeline but said the proposal could be revived with enough signed
contracts to prove construction is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Martucci, a spokesman for ANR Pipeline Co., said Friday that
the consortium has secured contracts for 38 percent of the proposed
capacity for service and 30 percent more are being sought.
</P>
<P>
   Martucci said construction could start in spring of 2002 and be
finished by November of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Corp's ANR Pipeline is a partner in the $680 million
project with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. and National Fuel
Gas Supply Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from those companies will meet in the next 30
days to decide whether to accept the conditions set by the federal
regulators. Those conditions mainly deal with environmental and
farmland protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure those conditions are there because of the concerns
from landowners,'' Martucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for opponents is to file trespassing charges
against pipeline employees. Some homeowners along the proposed
route say pipeline workers surveyed their land without permission,
a charge the partnership denies.
</P>
<P>
   Seneca County Commissioner Janet Dell said an appeal should be
started immediately.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Said To Leave VP Race  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a top
prospect to be Al Gore's running mate, urged the vice president in
a private conversation to pick somebody else, according to
Democratic officials who say the Missouri lawmaker is still a
potential pick.
</P>
<P>
   Party sources have said the Missouri lawmaker and Massachusetts
Sen. John Kerry appear to be the strongest candidates to be Gore's
choice, but Gephardt's staff worked Friday to dampen speculation.
Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and former Sen. George Mitchell of Maine
round out the top tier, with several other names still in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has narrowed
his choices, but he, too, is said to still have several people
under consideration. They include New York Gov. George Pataki, who
met with Bush Friday to discuss the vice presidency. Two other
Republican governors, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Frank Keating
of Oklahoma, are considered by GOP officials to be more likely
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting Gephardt for the Democratic ticket would leave a hole
in the party's House leadership, just as the party is trying to
erase the Republicans' paper-thin majority. Gephardt hopes to be
speaker in a Democratic-led House, and his allies on Capitol Hill
have predicted he wouldn't take the running mate's job -- though
news of the meeting with Gore shook their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his advisers, including former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and campaign chairman William Daley, are not
discussing the process. Thus, the Democratic officials cautioned
that handicapping the decision-making was an inexact exercise.
</P>
<P>
   However, several Democratic sources, including one familiar with
Gore's running mate operation, said Gephardt and Gore talked
privately last weekend about the impact of putting the lawmaker on
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Gephardt adviser said he sought the meeting to point Gore in
another direction. His message to Gore was, ''If you really think I
could make a difference then we should have a conversation, but
(taking a spot on the ticket) would be a hard thing to do and I
really think you should look at other people,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, chief architect of the party's bid to reclaim the
House, has decided not to participate in the customary candidate
background check, according to a Gephardt adviser who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The source close to Gore said Gephardt's entreaty and decision
not to undergo a background check don't necessarily mean he won't
be asked to take the job, though the vice president ''is aware of
the downside'' to picking him.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, 59, requested the meeting after Christopher repeatedly
made it clear Gephardt was under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast meeting occurred Saturday at the vice president's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's spokeswoman, Laura Nichols, said her boss ''is
focused on winning back the House. He's leaving the speculation to
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, including some close to Gore, believe Gephardt
would help the vice president shore up his support with the liberal
wing of the party, particularly labor, as well as improve his
prospects in a key battleground state.
</P>
<P>
   A failed presidential candidate in 1988, Gephardt is accustomed
to the scrutiny of the national stage. He has traveled the country
for years on behalf of House Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats worry that Gephardt's departure would hurt the
party's chance of winning back the House. However, not wanting to
admit any advantage to the GOP opposition, Democratic aides were
telling reporters Friday that there would be a ''seamless
transition'' if Gephardt left.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential convention begins Aug. 14 in Los
Angeles, two weeks after the Republicans gather in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republicans believe Govs. Ridge of Pennsylvania and
Keating of Oklahoma are getting serious consideration from Bush,
along with Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel and Tennessee Sen. Fred
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, a moderate, would help Bush carry a big state and appeal
to moderates across the country. Despite the governor's
abortion-rights position, one-third of self-described abortion
opponents in Pennsylvania say they would be more likely to vote for
Bush with Ridge on the ticket. Bush advisers say they could
overcome opposition from the party's right wing if Bush selected
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Keating would be safer pick, though he has raised eyebrows in
Austin with remarks that were deemed less than loyal during the
primaries. Hagel is a Vietnam veteran close to Arizona Sen. John
McCain, a proven vote-getter. Thompson could give Gore fits in
their home state.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Bush could still make a surprise pick, perhaps from
among the group of people who have withdrawn their names. That list
includes McCain, retired Gen. Colin Powell and former Missouri Sen.
John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore appears to be looking for a
candidate who reinforces the image of a serious, experienced public
servant who is ready to step into the job. Kerry, a Vietnam War
veteran who is well liked by Gore, fits the mold, according to Gore
advisers. They say Bush would suffer in the contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Graham comes from a state that Republicans need to win to reach
270 electoral votes and victory. Graham will fill in for Gore at a
Tennessee Democratic dinner, an event some campaign officials
believe is a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska and John Edwards of North Carolina and Govs. James B.
Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, Gray Davis of California and Tom
Vilsack of Iowa have also been under consideration.

<HEADLINE> Election Report: Corzine Spent $36M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The final report is in: Jon Corzine spent a
record $36.7 million, including more than $34 million of his own
money, to beat former Gov. Jim Florio and win New Jersey's
Democratic nomination for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever spent that much in an entire campaign for
Senate, let alone a primary.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's final report to the Federal Election Commission,
released Friday, showed that his campaign paid $31 million from
January to June for TV commercials, consultants, and staff and
offices in virtually every county in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine won the primary June 6 with 58 percent of the vote. The
former Wall Street executive, who has a fortune estimated at more
than $400 million, will run in November against Republican Rep. Bob
Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has wasted no time criticizing Corzine's heavy spending.
Corzine defended it as necessary for him as a newcomer to build
name recognition in the New York and Philadelphia TV markets, among
the nation's costliest.

<HEADLINE> New chancellor named at University of Missouri-Rolla  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - Gary Thomas, former provost and
professor of electrical engineering at the New Jersey Institute of
Technology, has been named the new chancellor of the University of
Missouri-Rolla.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 62, was named to the position Friday by the University
of Missouri System Board of Curators, which oversees the
four-campus system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am delighted to have this opportunity to head one of the
nation's pre-eminent engineering schools,'' Thomas said. ''I
believe my own experience with teaching, research and research
funding will blend well with the university's own strategic plans
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who will take over Sept. 1, was one of four finalists
for the job. His selection to replace John T. Park was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas will earn $190,000 a year for overseeing the academic and
administrative operations at the 5,000-student campus, located
about 50 miles south of the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas served as provost and senior vice president at the
Newark, N.J., school from 1990 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He also served on a temporary basis as vice president for
research and graduate studies. From 1980 to 1990, he was vice
president of academic affairs.

<HEADLINE> Dexter chairman blames takeover bid for company breakup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) - Dexter Corp.'s top official told
shareholders Friday that the 233-year-old company's pending breakup
was the product of capitalism's dark side - a hostile takeover
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at what was expected to be Dexter's final annual
meeting, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer K. Grahame Walker
told more than 100 shareholders that the board of directors had no
choice but to sell itself off in pieces to avoid the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   International Specialty Products Inc., of Wayne, N.J., mounted
an often-heated campaign this year to buy Dexter, the oldest
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. But ISP gave up the
fight earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''When ISP appeared ... it was like introducing a virus into a
controlled environment,'' Walker said. ''The industrial disease of
uncertainty began to spread. ... We were put into the position of
having no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   An ISP spokesman said Friday that the company had no comment on
Walker's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ISP, led by investor Samuel Heyman, had fought with Dexter over
Dexter's controlling interest in Life Technologies, a biotech
company in Rockville, Md. Heyman, who controlled most of the
remaining shares of Life Technologies, believed Dexter and Life
Technologies were ill-suited together.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman gave up the takeover bid earlier this month, after Dexter
announced a $1.9 billion cash and stock deal to sell Life
Technologies to Invitrogen Corp., a San Diego-based maker of tools
used in gene cloning and research. Heyman said the deal would be
valuable to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter, which makes products for the aerospace, electronics,
food packaging and medical markets, will cease to exist by this
fall. The company plans to sell its nonwoven materials division for
$275 million to Finland-based Ahlstrom Corp. and sell its
electronic materials, adhesives and polymer systems operation for
$400 million to Hartford-based Loctite Corp., a subsidiary of the
Henkel Group of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders did not vote on any of the sales at the meeting.
The only actions taken were the elections of three board of
directors members and the hiring an auditor for the 2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in New
Haven on the proposed sale to Loctite. Heyman sued seeking to
require a stockholders vote on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   A Dexter shareholder vote on the Ahlstrom deal is scheduled to
occur in about six weeks, said Michael Freitag, a spokesman for
Dexter. And the Invitrogen deal is expected to be finalized in late
September or early October.
</P>
<P>
   After the deals are complete, Dexter stockholders will be
offered $62.50 per share in cash, Invitrogen stocks or a
combination of both. Dexter stock was selling Friday for $54.69 per
share and Invitrogen stock was selling for $64.25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   ISP had offered Dexter $45 per share in the takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Dexter name may not disappear. Ahlstrom is
buying the rights to the name, and Loctite will have permission to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter D. Coffin Jr., a descendent of company founder Seth
Dexter and a major stockholder, flew up from Florida with his wife,
Mary, to attend the meeting. They control a trust with 1.3 million
shares, or 5.6 percent of the company's voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very sad day,'' Coffin said.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Prosecutor's Suicide Confirmed  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- An autopsy has confirmed that the county's
top prosecutor killed himself after an investigation into his
finances was launched, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office believes State Attorney Harry Lee
Coe shot himself Wednesday night as he sat against a support column
underneath an expressway.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found Thursday by the television reporter who broke
the stories about Coe's seeking $12,000 in loans from employees.
Coe said he considered the employees longtime friends and said he'd
done nothing wrong, but Gov. Jeb Bush launched an investigation
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Coe, 68, left a letter in his apartment with
instructions to be carried out after his death, but they did not
characterize it as a suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Coe's finances and allegations that he
destroyed computer records related to online betting will continue,
a state spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A former circuit court judge, Coe was elected Hillsborough
County state attorney in 1992. He was seeking his third four-year
term in November.
</P>
<P>
   Flags at local government buildings flew at half-staff Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the problems were, he was a friend and was very much
loved by this city and the whole area,'' said The Rev. Ron Clark,
pastor of Living Water Church and Coe's friend for 13 years. ''He
had 30 years of public service, you can't forget all of that for
one terrible day.''

<HEADLINE> NYPD probe targeted black officer and his outspoken group  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The NYPD's internal affairs bureau conducted
probes of a black officers' group often critical of the department
and of its leader, Lt. Eric Adams, for an allegation not related to
his organization, a police official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two separate investigations were revealed during testimony
that Deputy Chief Raymond King of the Internal Affairs Bureau gave
Thursday in Manhattan Federal Court. King was testifying at the
civil trial of a former officer who is suing the department,
claiming she was wrongfully fired.
</P>
<P>
   King made the statements under cross-examination by New York
Civil Liberties Union attorney Christopher Dunn, regarding a
question about investigations of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, and Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Friday he was ''bewildered and concerned'' about the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last five years, since our organization was put in
place, we've prided ourselves in bringing about some type of
harmony within the police force,'' Adams said. ''I cannot imagine
what we have done in the last five years that would prompt this.
We've held ourselves to a strict code and expect our members to do
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams also said there were no personal problems at work that
would warrant an investigation, and added that during the time he
was under surveillance, he was promoted from sergeant to
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   From August to October 1998, IAB conducted surveillance of Adams
and collected his phone records, King testified. King did not say
why IAB was investigating Adams. On Friday, Deputy Chief Tom Fahey,
a police spokesman, refused to say what the allegation was, only
saying it did not involved 100 Blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were made against Adams, but Fahey would not
disclose what it was, or who filed it. The case was closed in June
1999 and deemed ''unsubstantiated,'' meaning the charges could not
be proved or disputed.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, IAB began a separate probe into 100 Blacks. King
did not say what the probe was about, but a police source, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said it involved complaints from two
black officers in the Street Crime Unit that members of 100 Blacks
were allegedly harassing them following the fatal police shooting
of Amadou Diallo in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The group allegedly wanted the Street Crime cops to tell them
about alleged racist activities within the unit. Diallo, a West
African immigrant, was shot by four white Street Crime officers,
who were acquitted of all charges in February.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 Blacks probe was closed and deemed unsubstantiated in
March 1999. Adams denied that the group has ever intimidated
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey defended both probes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation techniques used were consistent with an
investigation of this nature and subsequently, the allegations were
unsubstantiated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he would ask the department for the records of the
investigations, but said it was too early to decide if he will sue
to have the records released.
</P>
<P>
   King was testifying at the civil trial of Yvette Walton, a
former officer who claims she was fired because she spoke out at a
City Council hearing on the Street Crime Unit following the Diallo
shooting. Walton was fired a week after she testified, but police
officials said she was dismissed because she abused sick-leave
privileges. Her case was still being heard.

<HEADLINE> Strategy Against Milosevic Discussed  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SVETI STEFAN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Montenegro's pro-Western
government officials and Serbian opposition leaders pledged Friday
to counter President Slobodan Milosevic moves to expand his powers
in the tiny Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in this Montenegrin coastal resort, the politicians
also called for democratic changes in Serbia and a redefinition of
relations within the Yugoslavia federation to ensure equality
between tiny Montenegro and much larger Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democratic forces of Montenegro and Serbia will work together
to establish a stable, successful and pro-European union of
Montenegro and Serbia,'' a joint statement read by Montenegro's
prime minister, Filip Vujanovic, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state union can function successfully only with full
respect of specific interests of Montenegro and Serbia,'' the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held in the wake of recent changes of the
federal constitution imposed by Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments passed last week by the Yugoslav federal assembly
are aimed at concentrating power in the hands of Milosevic while
reducing Montenegro's status.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government quickly rejected the amendments; its
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said that his republic
doesn't want to be reduced to a ''Serbian province'' and would move
toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crisis has raised fears that Milosevic would order
the federal army to intervene in Montenegro. Similar interventions
led to previous Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic on Friday received a delegation of his supporters from
Montenegro, representatives of the so-called Council of National
Assemblies, which includes pro-Serb Montenegrins from the north of
the republic, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from Milosevic's office, the delegation
came to inform the president about ''maximum support of the great
majority of the people of Montenegro for the unbreakable union with
Serbia, for the constitutional changes and for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other former Yugoslav republics, Montenegro has
moved away from Belgrade without violence. It has won many of the
trappings of a sovereign state, including a separate currency and
police force and virtual control of the nation's borders.

<HEADLINE> Venetian, Guggenheim in talks to bring museum branch to neon city  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) - The Guggenheim Museum and slot machines aren't
usually mentioned together, but a potential deal to bring a
Guggenheim branch to this gambling mecca could inject some
much-needed culture into a city long defined by blinking neon and
showgirls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Las Vegas could use a little culture,'' Marvin
Roffman, a gambling analyst for Roffman Miller Associates, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Venetian hotel-casino is in discussions with the Guggenheim
Museum to create a Guggenheim branch on a parcel adjacent to the
Strip resort's parking garage. The 35,000-square-foot building
would serve as a venue for shows from the New York-based museum and
would be designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, the Los Angeles
Times and the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It also would be the first significant collaboration between
such an institution and a hotel-casino in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As early as next year the Guggenheim plans to lend its popular
''The Art of the Motorcycle'' show to the Venetian, the newspapers
reported. Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry has been asked to
design the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Venetian and museum officials offered little detail on the
talks. A spokesman for the Guggenheim said the museum would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in discussions with the Guggenheim and notable
architects, but nothing is final at this stage,'' said Kurt
Ouchida, Venetian spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The final design is still under development. The prospect of a
Guggenheim exhibit at the Venetian is an exciting partnership, not
only for our property but for Las Vegas as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times also reported Gehry and Guggenheim Director Thomas
Krens have been in talks with Venetian owner Sheldon Adelson to
expand the Guggenheim's presence at the $1.5 billion hotel-casino
when the resort expands.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim might have to compete with the Phillips
Collection of Washington D.C., which is negotiating with MGM Mirage
to have an exhibit at the Bellagio hotel-casino.
</P>
<P>
   But do tourists really want to see a Picasso in between playing
slot machines and blackjack? After all, Las Vegas has never really
had a reputation as a city of culture.
</P>
<P>
   When a fine art gallery opened at the glitzy Bellagio resort in
1998, some were unsure how it would mix in a city with roller
coasters and cheap buffets. But Las Vegas has been attracting more
upscale travelers, especially as the city increasingly plays host
to more business conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason why it's happening is because it was working
at Bellagio,'' Roffman said. ''So, I guess if you're on vacation,
then why not do that? There's a lot of people that have never seen
a Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio founder Steve Wynn took half his $400 million art
collection with him when he left after MGM Grand Inc. acquired
Mirage Resorts Inc. and formed MGM Mirage earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces were sold to Wynn and various collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn has since acquired the Desert Inn hotel-casino and plans to
demolish it to build a new property, complete with his own art
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, spokesman for MGM Mirage, said bringing an exhibit
from the Phillips Collection ''will be a magnificent opportunity
for Bellagio and for the city of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bellagio will have other rotating collections as well,
Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit would tentatively be called ''Masterworks from the
Phillips Collection'' and would feature 20 to 30 pieces by several
artists, including Pablo Picasso, Edgar Degas, Paul Cezanne and
Claude Monet, said Lynn Rossotti, spokeswoman for the Phillips
Collection. It could open later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a huge diverse and international audience in Las
Vegas,'' Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Collection has traveling exhibitions at venues all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti and Feldman said the deal should be completed in the
next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This fits in with what Las Vegas has to be in the future,''
said Bill Thompson, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor of
public administration and gambling expert. ''If we don't do this
we're in the same league with the Indian casinos and the river
boats. We should aspire to be in our league.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign QB Todd Husak  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins signed quarterback
Todd Husak, their sixth-round draft pick from Stanford, to a
two-year, $498,000 contract Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the contract represents a victory of sorts for
Husak's agent, Steve Baker. Baker wanted a deal for two years
instead of three to give his client more flexibility in case Husak
moves up the depth chart over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Todd is different than most late-round quarterbacks in that he
has looked impressive already, and it looks as if he is in the
Redskins future,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Husak, who led the Cardinal to their first Rose Bowl appearance
in 28 years, made quick progress in the team's spring minicamp. He
is expected to be the third-string quarterback behind Brad Johnson
and Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   Husak took a smaller signing bonus, $30,000, to get the two-year
deal. The Redskins offered him $45,000 to sign for a three-year
deal. His salary will be the NFL minimum, $193,000 the first year
and $275,000 the second.
</P>
<P>
   Husak will report with his fellow rookies and selected veterans
for a three-day minicamp Monday before training camp opens
Thursday. The Redskins two first-round draft picks, LaVar Arrington
and Chris Samuels, remain unsigned, but their deals are expected to
be completed shortly after owner Dan Snyder returns from an
out-of-town trip Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins also signed two free-agent tackles, first-year
player Cornell Green from Central Florida and rookie Phumi Masimini
from Howard. Rookie tackle Brad Mussina was released.

Tobacco Cos. Ordered To Pay $145B
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A jury took less than five hours today to decide that the
tobacco industry should pay a record-shattering $145 billion in punitive damages
to sick Florida smokers -- an amount industry lawyers predicted would break the
industry. Stock prices of the five companies were down moderately following the
ruling on the two-year trial. The companies plan to appeal, and the verdict will
likely be tied up in the appeals process for years and is not expected to have
any immediate impact on the industry.

government does not bear responsibility for the deaths of 80 Branch Davidians
during the cult's 1993 standoff with federal agents. A federal judge will
deliver the final verdict. The $675 million wrongful-death lawsuit was filed by
surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of those who were killed. The trial,
which lasted nearly a month, brought out emotional testimony recounting the
standoff from both sides. U.S. District Judge Walter Smith said he would render
his verdict soon, possibly in August.

taxes originally imposed to prevent concentration of vast wealth in few hands.
Ignoring Democratic arguments that it was a tax cut for the very richest
Americans, senators voted 59-39 to pass the ''death tax'' elimination bill.

   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Some 90,000 Eritreans who took refuge in Sudan during
their country's war with neighboring Ethiopia will be begin returning home under
an agreement reached Friday, officials said. The agreement among the United
Nations, Sudan and Eritrea would permit the return of refugees living in three
camps for more than two months after being forced to flee their shops and farms
by fighting in the 2-year war between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Peter Kessler, the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' spokesman in Eritrea, said the first
organized transport to return the refugees would be provided next week.

among its teams and perhaps even move franchises. Baseball admitted its clubs
had a collective $1.4 billion in operating losses since the start of the 1994-95
strike and are a collective $2.1 billion in debt. Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, former Federal Reserve board chairman Paul Volcker, Yale president
Richard Levin and political commentator George Will, who had access to all of
the sport's financial data, didn't say the sport needs a salary cap and didn't
recommend changes to free agency or salary arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Owners Put Off Realignment  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After listening to an analysis of their economic
problems, baseball owners voted Friday to put off realignment until
2002 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Owners unanimously adopted the return to an unbalanced schedule,
in which teams play more games against their division rivals. The
American League had gone to a balanced schedule in 1977 and the
National League followed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig said returning to an unbalanced schedule
''fulfilled a dream of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they all don't take 25 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under an unbalanced schedule, teams play more games against
clubs in their own division. In a balanced schedule, they play
approximately the same number of games against all teams within
their league.
</P>
<P>
   While there appeared to be a majority supporting Selig's plan to
move Arizona from the NL West to the AL West, Texas from the AL
West to the AL Central and Tampa Bay to the National League, and
then realign the NL into four four-team divisions, Kansas City,
Minnesota and the Chicago White Sox objected because they didn't
want to be in a six-team division.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona always wanted to remain in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ''One member told me, 'Welcome back to the National League,' ''
Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo said. ''I didn't know I was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said realignment would be examined again in coming months
as the 2002 schedule is made. After November 2001, Arizona gains
the power to block being moved without its consent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need some franchise realignment, there is no question about
that,'' Selig said. ''One could debate how extensive that should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of next year's schedule, the Texas Rangers and Houston
Astros will meet in interleague play for the first time next year.
Other than that, the interleague lineup could remain the same: AL
East vs. NL East, AL Central vs. NL Central and AL West vs. NL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is trying to develop a schedule in which interleague
opponents rotate, except for natural rivals such as Mets-Yankees
and Cubs-White Sox. Selig said a decision on whether interleague
play will rotate next year will be made in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As for the unbalanced schedule, teams in the AL East, AL
Central, NL East and NL West will play their divisional rivals 19
times, up from 12-13 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL West, teams will face division rivals 19-20 times and
in the NL Central, which has six teams, each club will play each
opponent in its division 16 or 17 times.

<HEADLINE> State Democrats nominate Sen. Lieberman for re-election  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - With disco balls flashing and rock music
pumping, state Democrats Friday nominated U.S. Sen. Joseph
Lieberman to a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who is wildly popular among Democrats and is
respected among many Republicans, accepted the nomination with a
promise that he would work to bring prosperity to people who have
been left out of the current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to find ways to expand the winners circle and to lift
up those Connecticut families that have still been left behind,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats at their state convention Friday also elected the
party's eight representatives to the electoral college and three
members of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of party chairman Ed Marcus withdrew their plan to try
to change the rules for electing a party chairman. Instead, party
committee members agreed to hold a vote to expand membership in the
state central committee, which elects the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But the night belonged to Lieberman, complete with a parade of
Democrats waving campaign lawn signs and projections of ''Lieberman
2000'' on the darkened walls of the auditorium at Southern
Connecticut State University.
</P>
<P>
   As an Orthodox Jew, Lieberman ordinarily does not attended
Friday night party conventions because he is observing the Sabbath.
This year, the convention began earlier in the day and was held in
his home city of New Haven, allowing him to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said if he is re-elected he will support legislation
to boost innovation and accountability in public schools and to
make it easier for students to afford college.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would support gun control laws and a ban on
discrimination against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, also promised to fight for prescription drug
benefits for Medicare recipients and to strengthen Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am an optimist. We can do it,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated by U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, who made light of talk
that Lieberman is a candidate for the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe has said some strange things to me lately,'' Dodd joked:
'''Didn't you find the vice president's book ''Earth in the
Balance'' a captivating read?' he said, and, 'How do you think I
look in brown suits?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has said he is not seeking the job, but would consider
it if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano is challenging
Lieberman. Giordano has accused the senator of being too interested
in his national profile and not spending enough time understanding
the needs of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's acceptance speech made no mention of his most
high-profile moment on the national political stage: when he became
the first Democrat on the floor of Congress to publicly denounce
President Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Lieberman praised Clinton and Vice President Al Gore,
the Democrats' choice for president, for launching the country's
longest run of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a committee of the party voted to allow the
state central committee, which acts as the board of directors for
the party, to decide whether to add at-large members. Additional
members would be added by a 2/3rds vote of the committee, in any
number the committee sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   Glastonbury lawyer Nick Paindiris withdrew his plan to challenge
Marcus by moving to have the whole 1,400-member convention, not
just the central committee, elect the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have the votes, so we said, 'Let's not go on with it
and be embarrassed,''' Paindiris said.
</P>
<P>
   The night also featured speeches by the party's nominees for the
U.S. House of Representatives, who are nominated in district
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The convention offered a chance for politicians with higher
aspirations to do some glad-handing with prospective supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians with ambitions of higher office hosted
hospitality tents outside the convention, offering munchies, drinks
and political memorabilia to the conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest post-convention tent belonged to Senate Majority
Leader George Jepsen, D-Stamford, who is laying the groundwork for
a run for governor or attorney general in 2002. Jepsen's tent
featured Dixieland music, hot dogs and free beer.

<HEADLINE> West. Sahara Rebels Want Referendum  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Western Sahara's rebels said Friday a
referendum is the only acceptable option to determine whether the
territory remains part of Morocco or becomes independent.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a decade-long dispute over who is eligible to vote
in a referendum, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report to
the Security Council Thursday that it might be time to consider
other options.
</P>
<P>
   Annan endorsed several possible alternatives suggested by his
personal envoy, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III,
such as a negotiated agreement for Western Sahara's full
integration with Morocco, full independence, or something in
between.
</P>
<P>
   But the independence-seeking rebel Polisario Front immediately
rejected all of the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Only ''a free and fair referendum of self-determination can
bring about a just and lasting solution to the conflict of Western
Sahara,'' the Polisario Front's representative to the United
Nations, Ahmed Boukhari, said in a letter to the council.
</P>
<P>
   Any other approach would deprive the people of Western Sahara of
their right to self-determination, which is recognized by the
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco has not yet responded to the possible alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   War broke out in the Western Sahara in 1976 after Spain
abandoned the territory and Morocco annexed it, moving in settlers.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 Polisario Front guerrilla fighters battled
Morocco's U.S.-equipped army until 1991, when the war ended with a
U.N.-negotiated cease-fire and plans to hold a referendum to either
remain part of Morocco or become independent.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been registering voters, but nearly
140,000 people -- most of them based in Morocco -- have appealed
rulings that they weren't eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Baker met with representatives of Morocco and the Polisario
Front in London on June 28 but Annan said neither side offered
proposals to bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both insisted on a 'winner-take-all' approach and did not
appear willing to discuss a solution where each would get some, but
not all, of what each wanted,'' Annan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the continuing divisions, Baker suggested possible
alternatives during the London meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of talks in scheduled in Geneva later this month.

<HEADLINE> MSG Sues Yanks Over Cable Contract  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Madison Square Garden Network has sued the New
York Yankees, claiming that owners of the baseball club are trying
to destroy the cable network and steal its right to broadcast
Yankees games.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Friday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, MSG
says Yankees owners are violating contractual rights that MSG
''bargained for carefully and paid for handsomely'' in a $500
million deal in 1988. That deal expires at the end of the current
baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers say that in a letter dated July 5 the Yankees made
MSG a ''sham'' offer that would, among other things, call for MSG's
cable TV network to be swallowed up by a new broadcast network
called Newco.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offer, court papers say, would force MSG to buy
into Newco, pay its start-up costs, and abandon telecasts of other
teams which include the New York Knicks, Rangers and Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   MSG says the Yankees wanted an answer within seven business days
of July 6 or the club would finalize talks with Newco, which does
not yet exist and which will be 95 percent owned and controlled by
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Schiller, chairman of the holding company that controls
the Yankees' broadcasts and other enterprises, called YankeeNets,
did not dispute MSG's description of the offer, and he said they
have a right to match it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's called competition,'' Schiller said. ''In America
that's allowed. Not only that, it's encouraged and legally
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   But MSG claimed the offer violates its contractual ''right of
last refusal,'' which gives MSG the right to try to match the
club's last offer from a third party for the right to carry Yankees
games, court papers say. MSG contends that Newco is really the
Yankees, and does not constitute a third party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when the Yankee deal was signed, MSG Network had about
2 million subscribers and revenues of about $39.6 million, but in
1999, the network had 7.6 million subscribers and earned some $219
million, court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   MSG is asking the court for a permanent injunction to keep the
Yankees from closing a deal with any other television carrier and
to declare that MSG has the right to meet and beat any offer the
Yankees get.
</P>
<P>
   MSG failed in its attempt to receive a temporary restraining
order, but the Yankees agreed to give the network a two-week
extension to match the IMG deal.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Yankees, the club
''carefully followed the terms and conditions of the their
agreement with Madison Square Garden. The plaintiff is way off
base. We are reserving further comment until we study their
papers.''

<HEADLINE> Gore's Daughter Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Al Gore was home babysitting Friday, his
eldest daughter collected some $25,000 for the Democratic Party and
exhorted young Americans Friday to take this year's presidential
race as personally as she does.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff, more and more a fixture on the campaign
trail, recalled for the College Democrats of America annual
convention the year that her father and Bill Clinton claimed the
White House:
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time I voted was in the 1992 primary and boy, I
really underestimated the impact of that election on my life,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other young people, only a third of whom voted in the 1996
election, should similarly see the race between her father and
Republican George W. Bush as a matter of ''personal well-being, not
just civic responsibility,'' said Schiff, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Mother to 1-year-old Wyatt, Schiff said she dropped him at the
vice presidential residence before heading out to two appearances
on Dad's behalf. She laughed as she recounted her only instructions
to Gore for babysitting Wyatt: ''He needs to eat at 6:30. Don't
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   At The George Washington University, College Democrats president
Kevin Nicholson heralded Schiff as ''one of the starring members of
the Democratic Party and the future of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   She has cultivated a network of young party contributors, which
she activated again on Friday night at a Capitol Hill microbrewery
and restaurant where she played host at a $25,000 fund raiser for
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   She gave student activists a speech that she had typed out in
advance -- sprinkled with hip lingo -- but delivered with ease and
flair. Her pony tail secured by a rubber band, with a sparkly
barrette over one ear and a plain brown bobby pin over the other,
she projected a ''real person'' image in stark contrast to the
celebrity status accorded her at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Four TV news cameras crushed around her -- and four boom
microphones captured her every utterance as from overhead -- as she
shook each of the 150 or so students' hands, posing for pictures
with dozens of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must accept that our action or inaction will have real
consequences on our lives. 'Whatever' might be a lot worse than
what we expect or deserve,'' Schiff warned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every ad agency in America is salivating over us. Our consumer
power moves fashion trends, dictates bestsellers, turns obscure
rock bands into superstars. We should harness that power to make
the highest leaders of the land accountable to our voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said she will play an active role at next month's
Democratic National Convention, ''speaking to a lot of different
groups and going to a lot of parties.'' And, whether her father
wins or loses in November, she said ''definitely will'' stay
involved in politics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Jan Karski, a former Polish diplomat who
provided early eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the West
during World War II, died Thursday of heart and kidney ailments. He
was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jan Kozielewski in 1914, he joined the Polish diplomatic
service in 1935 and served as an artillery officer in the September
1939 campaign against the Nazi invasion. He was captured by the Red
Army after the Soviets invaded Poland a few weeks later, but
escaped to join the underground.
</P>
<P>
   As an officer in the Polish resistance, he made four runs to the
West with reports from underground leaders to the exiled Polish
government. He was captured in Slovakia in 1940 and tortured by the
Nazi Gestapo, but he escaped with the help of Polish partisans who
attacked the prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, disguised as a Nazi guard, Karski sneaked into the
Izbica death camp in eastern Poland and twice entered the Warsaw
Ghetto, where he witnessed mass killing and torture of Jews. He
brought his story to the West, briefing political and religious
leaders in London and then meeting with President Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Karski's report, and pressure from the Polish exiles, led to the
Allies' 1942 statement condemning German crimes against the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Story of a Secret State,'' a book Karski wrote about the
resistance, life in occupied Poland and Nazi atrocities, appeared
in 1944 in the United States and became a bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   Karski settled in the United States and lectured on
international affairs at Georgetown University in Washington.
Meredith MacRae:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Meredith MacRae, who played comely country
girl Billie Jo Bradley in the 1960s sitcom ''Petticoat Junction,''
died Friday from brain cancer. She was 56.
</P>
<P>
   MacRae played Billie Jo from 1966-70 on the CBS series, which
starred Bea Benaderet as the widowed owner of the Shady Rest Hotel
and mother of three eye-catching daughters who helped run the
Hooterville establishment.
</P>
<P>
   MacRae was born in Houston to a Hollywood family: Her father was
the late actor-singer Gordon MacRae, who played the lovesick cowboy
Curly in ''Oklahoma!'' Her mother is actress-comedian Sheila MacRae
(''The Honeymooners'').
</P>
<P>
   Meredith MacRae made her film debut at age 7 in ''By the Light
of the Silvery Moon'' (1953), which starred her father and Doris
Day. Her first TV series was ''My Three Sons,'' in which she played
Sally, the love interest for Mike (Tim Considine) from 1963-65.
</P>
<P>
   She launched a TV talk show career with ''Mid-Morning L.A.,''
which she co-hosted with Geoff Edwards. It ran for eight years and
won her a local Emmy in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   MacRae worked with a variety of charities and civic groups
including the League of Women Voters, Women in Film and the United
Cerebral Palsy Foundation. She served as the foundation's telethon
host for two decades.
Jimmy McDonald
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jimmy McDonald, whose activism in civil rights
took him aboard a bus bound for the South to battle racial
inequality in the 1960s, died on Tuesday after a brief illness. He
was 69.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was one of 14 original members of the Freedom Riders,
who worked against Jim Crow segregation laws. The bus was bombed
during his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, McDonald continued his advocacy for civil
rights. As a member of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People in Yonkers, he attempted to increase minority
voting turnout.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald worked in the entertainment industry, and was the host
of two television programs, ''Black Journal'' and ''Black
Perspective on the News.'' He went on to serve as the executive
director of the Human Rights Commission in Yonkers.
William H. Willis:
</P>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- William H. Willis, professor emeritus of
Greek at Duke University and an international expert on ancient
documents, died Thursday after a stroke. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Willis was an instructor at Yale and curator of its papyri and
parchments collection from 1940 to 1942, then became professor and
chairman of the University of Mississippi's Department of Classics
in 1946. He was director of Mississippi's University Archaeology
Museum until 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, he became a professor of Greek at Duke, where
he remained for 23 years. He brought his personal collection of
papyri -- ancient writings on papyrus -- and was instrumental in
building the university's collection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he and ancient history professor John Oates established
the Duke Data Bank of Documentary Papyri, an electronic repository
of ancient Greek texts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he completed ''The Archives of Ammon Scholasticus of
Panopolis,'' a collection of the papers of a lawyer who lived in
fourth-century Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Ventura To Have Shoulder Checked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mets third baseman Robin Ventura will be sent back
to New York to have nagging soreness in his right shoulder
examined.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura hurt the shoulder sliding head first into second base
during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant General Manager Jim Duquette said Friday the team
hoped the shoulder would improve over the All Star break. But
Ventura continued to complain of discomfort following Thursday's
game with Boston, when he went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's to the point where it's affecting his swing,'' Duquette
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura sat out Friday's game in Boston and was scheduled to
return to New York for an MRI Saturday. He'll be examined by team
doctor David Altchek.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said the injury was not related to his offseason
shoulder surgery. He added that he didn't anticipate placing
Ventura on the disabled list until after the results of the MRI
were known.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is hitting .235 with 16 home runs and 53 RBIs.

called Newco.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offer, court papers say, would force MSG to buy
into Newco, pay its start-up costs, and abandon telecasts of other
teams which include the basketball Knicks, the hockey Rangers and
women's basketball Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   MSG says the Yankees wanted an answer within seven business days
of July 6 or the club would finalize talks with Newco, which does
not yet exist and which will be 95 percent owned and controlled by
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Schiller, chairman of the holding company that controls
the Yankees' broadcasts and other enterprises, called YankeeNet,
did not dispute MSG's description of the offer, and he said they
have a right to match it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's called competition,'' Schiller said. ''In America
that's allowed. Not only that, it's encouraged and legally
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   But MSG claimed the offer violates its contractual ''right of
last refusal,'' which gives MSG the right to try to match the
club's last offer from a third party for the right to carry Yankees
games, court papers say. MSG contends that Newco is really the
Yankees, and does not constitute a third party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when the Yankee deal was signed, MSG Network had about
2 million subscribers and revenues of about $39.6 million, but in
1999, the network had 7.6 million subscribers and earned some $219
million, court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   MSG is asking the court for a permanent injunction to keep the
Yankees from closing a deal with any other television carrier and
to declare that MSG has the right to meet and beat any offer the
Yankees get.
</P>
<P>
   MSG failed in its attempt to receive a temporary restraining
order, but the Yankees agreed to give the network a two-week
extension to match the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Yankees, said the club
''carefully followed the terms and conditions of the their
agreement with Madison Square Garden. The plaintiff is way off
base. We are reserving further comment until we study their
papers.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Estate Tax Repeal  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton promising a veto,
Senate Republicans muscled through a bill on Friday that would
gradually repeal inheritance taxes originally imposed to prevent
concentration of vast wealth in few hands.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 59-39 to pass the ''death tax'' elimination bill,
ignoring Democratic arguments that it was a tax cut for the very
richest Americans. Sponsors portrayed the measure as a matter of
basic fairness and a remedy for a tax that punishes success, and
most Republicans were joined by nine Democrats in voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing is a cancer,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ''We
don't want it to be left for one person.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president called the repeal bill a budget buster that
provides ''a huge tax cut for the most well off Americans at the
expense of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement issued at Camp David, Md., where he is
hosting a Middle East peace conference, said the bill will explode
in cost as the years go on. He said it will cause a loss of tax
revenue of $100 billion in the decade beginning in 2001 and then
mushroom to an additional $750 billion loss in revenue from 2011 to
2020.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate is wrong to pass this costly, irresponsible and
regressive bill, which provides half of its benefits to about 3,000
families annually while more than 10 million Americans are waiting
for an increase in the minimum wage and tens of millions of seniors
lack dependable prescription drug coverage,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When this bill comes to my desk I will veto it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, well short of the two-thirds majority needed to
override a presidential veto, throws onto Clinton's lap one of the
GOP's top tax-cut priorities prior to the July 31 start of the
Republican convention -- reinforcing the party's tax cutting message
against Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then immediately began debating the next big
Republican tax cut: a 10-year, $248 billion measure that would
slash income taxes for millions of married couples, including 25
million who pay more than they would if single. Votes are expected
next week. Sending that bill to Clinton's desk is another
pre-convention political goal for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The president called the estate tax bill ''costly, irresponsible
and regressive'' and left no doubt in a statement Friday about its
ultimate fate: ''When this bill comes to my desk, I will veto it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of estates are now taxed by the federal
government -- in 1997, about 43,000 estates out of more than 2
million deaths were affected. But supporters of repealing the tax
said many families and business owners are forced to pay thousands
of dollars to lawyers and consultants for arrangements that protect
their money from tax rates as high as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''No family, no farm and no business should have to worry about
this sort of thing,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House in June with support from 65
Democrats, would cut the top 55 percent estate tax rate in 2001 and
then gradually phase out all other rates, with full repeal coming
in 2010. The cost was estimated at $105 billion during the
phaseout, rising to $750 billion during the following decade.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes date from 1916, a product of the progressive agenda
pushed years earlier by Republican President Theodore Roosevelt who
sought to ''preserve a measurable opportunity for the people''
instead of preserving ''those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, estate tax collections of about $25 billion represent
only about 1.5 percent of the federal government's overall yearly
tax haul, but rising incomes have forced more people to worry about
them. A house, a retirement plan and some insurance, experts say,
can quickly put a person's estate into the tax zone -- above
$675,000 for individuals and above $1.3 million for couples, farms
and small businesses. These levels are already scheduled by law to
increase to $1 million for individuals and $2 million for couples
by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ''A client worth a $1 billion will still be wealthy even if the
government takes half of it,'' said Beth Rodriguez, a wealth
strategist with J.P. Morgan. ''But if you're worth $3 million, and
they take half of it, that significantly changes your situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers eyeing huge budget surpluses also have responded to
individual horror stories about sold-off small businesses and lost
family farms, most of those individuals rounded up by lobbying
organizations such as the National Federation of Independent
Business and National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The estate tax is anti-competitive, anti-minority business,
anti-entrepreneur -- in sum, anti-American dream,'' said Tim
Hammonds, chief of the Food Marketing Institute, a group
representing food retailers and wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contended that the few smaller businesses and family
farms struck by the estate tax could easily be helped by simply
raising exemptions in current law.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to repeal say the statistics speak for themselves: For
example, in 1997 the 2,400 estates with assets above $5 million
paid half of all the taxes. Had the tax been repealed that year, it
would have meant a tax cut averaging $3.4 million for those
estates.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't disguise what you're doing here in terms of a large
tax cut for the wealthiest people in the United States,'' said Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, however, defeated a Democratic substitute costing
$64 billion over 10 years that would have sharply raised the estate
tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the government's revenue loss would be
cushioned somewhat because the bill changes the way assets are
valued so an heir would owe higher capital-gains taxes than under
current law once an inherited asset is sold. Capital-gains tax
rates, however, are much lower than estate tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also stripped from the bill amendments it had
approved Thursday, mainly to showcase election-year priorities,
including a repeal of the 3 percent excise tax on telephone
service.
</P>
<P>

   The bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> 9 Illegal Immigrants Drown  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- At least nine illegal immigrants from
Guatemala drowned after their boat capsized during a storm in
southern Mexico, the government news agency Notimex said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe there may have been 20 Central Americans
aboard the boat that sank Thursday in Lake Superior in the southern
Mexican state of Oaxaca, Notimex said. So far, rescue crews have
recovered nine bodies -- all Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor, Miguel Juan Francisco, told Notimex he and
the others boarded the boat before dawn Thursday near the
Mexico-Guatemala border.
</P>
<P>
   But as they entered the lake, violent winds started thrashing
the boat, Francisco told Notimex.

Edward and Sophie Arrive at Prince Edward Island
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTETOWN, Prince Edward Island (AP) -- Edward and Sophie,
the Earl and Countess of Wessex, arrived in Prince Edward Island on
Friday for their first state visit to Canada -- a test of the
glamour appeal of the Royal Family's newest couple.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, the Queen's youngest child, and his bride of one year,
the former Sophie Rhys-Jones, landed at Charlottetown Airport to
begin a weekend visit to the Island, which is named after the
prince's great-great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Edward, the
father of Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   From the airport, where they were greeted by federal Solicitor
General Lawrence MacAulay and several Prince Edward Island
politicians, they were driven to the historic provincial
legislature in Charlottetown, where the Fathers of Confederation
met in 1864.

Three-Year-Old Girl Dies, Father Arrested
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) --A three-year-old girl is dead and her father
arrested in her murder after a woman discovered her husband covered
in blood lying next to the body early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who had slash wounds on his wrists and ankles, was
conscious but not alert, Global TV said.
</P>
<P>
   After being treated at hospital, he was arrested, police said.
Although charges were not immediately laid, police said they were
processing the man late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl appeared to have been strangled, police told
CFTO News, but investigators would not confirm the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a three-year-old female deceased victim,'' said Det.
Sgt. Al Comeau. ''We also have a male who is her father who has
been arrested for the murder of this young girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Police did not identify either the girl or her father.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's body was found by her mother just before 8 a.m. in
their home in an upscale area of Toronto, police said.

Community Mourns For Murder-Suicide Victims
</P>
<P>
   KITCHENER, Ontario (AP) -- The mother of the man who stabbed his
wife to death before shooting their four children and turning the
gun on himself wept uncontrollably Friday at a memorial service for
the family she has lost.
</P>
<P>
   Miroslava Luft shook her head throughout the ceremony and
tearfully clung to family members as though she could still hardly
believe what her first-born son had done.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband Vilem was too distraught to attend the public event
which drew about 150 family members, friends and strangers
together.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes turned to collages of family photographs mounted on five
large frames on the altar of the International Gospel Center. They
showed the 42-year-old man, his wife Bohumila, 27, and their four
children Daniel, 7, Nicole, 5, Peter, 2 and 2&AMP;frac12;-month-old David, in
happier times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dialogue that says: 'what if, if only?' is redundant,'' Rev.
Mark Emmerson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't change the fact of this tragedy. We have to look at
the people behind the events that happened . . . six people whose
times were not all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the service, men could be seen wiping tears away and
sobbing women grasped their children's hands.

Federal, Provincial Health Ministers To Meet Next Week
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Health Minister Allan Rock is to meet his
provincial and territorial counterparts in Ottawa next week for a
long-delayed meeting on health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   All provincial ministers are expected to attend except Pauline
Marois of Quebec, who has a scheduling conflict, Rock spokeswoman
Catherine Lappe said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers are to meet for dinner on Wednesday and talk
business Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The last federal-provincial health meeting in March got nowhere
because provincial ministers insisted on restoration of federal
transfer payments to 1993-94 levels as a precondition to any
discussion of long-term reform.
</P>
<P>
   The provinces said that would require an additional $4.2 billion
in federal transfers annually.
</P>
<P>
   Rock, Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Finance Minister Paul
Martin have said they are ready to put more money into health care,
but not without consensus on reform.

<HEADLINE> Jones, Greene Win at Olympic Trials  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Marion Jones said she would not hold
much back in the women's 100-meter heats in the U.S. Olympic track
and field trials. She didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene didn't say it, but he showed what a force he
would be in the men's 100.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Jones, beginning her quest for an unprecedented
five gold medals in the Sydney Games, blasted through her
quarterfinal race Friday night in 10.92 seconds, only 0.08 seconds
off her world-leading time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who failed to make the 1996 team and then sobbed
inconsolably while watching the Olympic final in the stands at
Atlanta, burst out of the blocks with the force of a rocket and won
his heat in 9.93, only 0.02 seconds off his world-best this season.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Jones was slow out of the blocks, but by 30 meters she
had forged to the front, and at the 50-meter mark she was
comfortably ahead. Only near the finish did she slow slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was relieved to finally get going after all the pre-meet
hype.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody just wanted to go out there and get
started,'' the two-time world champion said. ''We're tired of all
the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad that the first round is over and I can move on to the
long jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying in the long jump, Jones' weakest event, was held
later Friday night. The semifinals and final of the 100 will be
Saturday and the long jump final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, Jones will compete in the 200 as she bids to
surpass the record of four Olympic golds by Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis
and Fanny Blankers-Koen.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones was the fastest qualifier in the 100, her major
rivals showed they weren't conceding anything to her.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Devers, the two-time Olympic gold medalist, broke 11
seconds for the first time this year, winning her heat at 10.99,
and Inger Miller, the silver medalist and 200 champion in last
year's World Championships, took her heat at 11.04 despite a very
slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to remember I've been here before and not panic,'' said
Devers, who also is the world leader in the 100 hurdles this year.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has bragged that she will block Jones' quest for
five golds, noted the strength of the 100 field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the younger girls are looking good and the older ones
are in tip-top form,'' said Miller, the daughter Of Jamaican
Olympic silver and bronze medalist Lennox Miller.
</P>
<P>
   One of the younger ones advancing was Angela Manuel. The
daughter of Chicago White Sox manager Jerry Manuel finished third
behind Jones at 11.31.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the two-time world champion and 1999 world champion,
showed no weaknesses in his heat. Charging right out from the
start, he had the field beaten easily about halfway through the
race, before easing some 20 meters from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   No one else broke 10 seconds in the heats, allowing Greene to
establish his early superiority and send a message to the rest of
the field.
</P>
<P>
   The next-fastest time was 10.03 by Brian Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' husband, C.J. Hunter, the 1999 world shot put champion
and the world leader this year, qualified automatically for
Saturday's final with a heave of 65 feet, 8&AMP;frac14; inches.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Nelson, No. 2 in the world this year, had the longest
qualifying throw, 68-3&AMP;frac34;. John Godina, the 1996 Olympic silver
medalist and two-time world champion, qualified at 65-3&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen women high jumpers qualified for Sunday's final by
clearing 5-10&AMP;frac34;, including 1996 trials champion Tisha Waller, 1996
Olympian Amy Acuff, NCAA champion Erin Aldrich, and Lynn Houston,
the sister of Allan Houston of the New York Knicks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The final report is in: Jon Corzine spent
$36.7 million, including about $34 million of his own money, to
beat former Gov. Jim Florio and win the Democratic nomination for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever spent that much money in an entire campaign for U.S.
Senate, never mind just a primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The sum is more than $6 million higher than the previous
American record for a U.S. Senate race set by Republican Michael
Huffington in California in 1994. He lost to U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's closing report to the Federal Elections Commission is
due Saturday, but was released by his office Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed Corzine's campaign paid out $31 million from
January to June for TV commercials, campaign consultants and staff
and offices in virtually every county in the state to cajole voters
to the polls. The report also shows the campaign had accrued
another $2 million in outstanding debts and obligations yet to be
paid.
</P>
<P>
   This is added to the $3.7 million Corzine spent last year -
money used to establish himself with the state's Democratic Party
that doubled Florio's spending for the entire primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The report consumes 237 pages just to detail the spending of
$9.8 million from May 18 to June 30, although most of that went out
in the three weeks before the June 6 primary. The vast majority of
the disbursements are small checks ranging from $5,000 to as low as
$25 for Corzine's army of campaign workers who hit the streets
across New Jersey on June 6 to get voters to the polls or to
supervise others who were doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine won soundly June 6 with 58 percent of the vote. Florio's
staff said they had expected the outcome to be closer, crediting
Corzine's skill at organizing in advance of primary election day to
ensure a large turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The former Wall Street executive, who has a personal fortune
estimated at more than $400 million, will run in November against
Republican nominee Bob Franks, a congressman representing the Union
County-based 7th District.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has wasted no time criticizing Corzine for his heavy
spending. Corzine defended it as necessary for him as a complete
newcomer to generate adequate name recognition in both the New York
and Philadelphia TV markets, among the nation's costliest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's spending figure confirmed earlier conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   A report filed with the FEC on May 25 showed the Corzine
campaign had spent $25 million as of May 17 with another $2 million
in debts. On May 26, that FEC report was amended with new documents
showing an added total of about $6 million had been pumped into the
campaign war chest, pushing the expected total to $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   While Corzine plowed $10 million into Shrum, Devine &AMP; Donilon of
Washington, D.C., for TV advertising in April and May, Friday's
final spending report shows only $560,000 going to the firm from
May 18 to June 6, probably because some of the ads in the final
weeks had been paid for earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Against this, the Friday report revealed a staggering volume of
small disbursements detailed on page after page of the phone-book
thick report, with such varied sums as $5,000 for street canvassing
coordinator Saidu Nguvu of Newark, down to $50 to Laird Stimes to
put up signs in the city and $25 to Ed Munoz for going door to door
to encourage voters. These smaller sums are repeated countless
numbers of times on a dozen different days for Stimes, Munoz and
scores of other field workers across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark Labor Action Committee, the political action wing of
city unions, received at least $90,000 in the final three weeks to
coordinate its members, feed them, supply them with literature and
address lists, and get them out onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also kept up the spending for county and local
Democratic Party organizations, adding $285,000 in the final three
weeks to the $600,000 he had given them prior to May 18.
</P>
<P>
   The report details Corzine's ''loans'' to his campaign,
including $3.3 million in checks he wrote to his own fund-raising
account on June 5 and June 6, Primary Day.
</P>
<P>
   To keep in touch with those voters, or to develop the ''bold
ideas'' of his campaign theme to win their support, Corzine from
May 18 to June 6 paid $867,567 to the Penn Schoen polling firm of
New York, adding to the $640,000 paid to them in mid-April. The
reports do not specify the nature of the polling.
</P>
<P>
   But gone from the reports are the $100,000 retainers Corzine had
paid to his old Wall Street law firm, Arkin, Shaffer and Kaplan. It
was disclosed in the week before the primary that some of this
money had gone to private investigators checking into Florio and
his staff, which Corzine claimed was done without his knowledge and
which he promptly put a halt to when Florio blew it up into a
public controversy.

<HEADLINE> Darsch Quits as Mystics Coach  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nancy Darsch, who never hit it off with rising
star Chamique Holdsclaw, resigned Friday as coach of the WNBA's
Washington Mystics.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Walker, who served as interim coach with the NBA's
Washington Wizards last season after Gar Heard was fired, will
perform the same role with the Mystics. Walker, also the team's
director of player personnel, held his first practice with the
Mystics late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not meeting the goals I set for myself or the team,''
Darsch said in a statement released by the team. ''I felt there was
a need for new leadership. There needed to be a change, so I made
the decision to step down. This team deserves to be in the
playoffs, and I wish them the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Darsch did not inform the players of the news herself, leaving
them surprised and left to speculate that recent poor performances
and bad karma had finally taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have you been to a game?'' said Holdsclaw, referring to the
boos and negative signs held up by fans recently at the MCI Center.
''It's pretty brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Darsch led the Mystics to a 12-20 record last season, a vast
improvement from 3-27 the previous year. But the Mystics are 9-11
this year, a disappointing record for a team projected to make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was Nancy's decision after conversations this week with
me,'' executive vice president Wes Unseld said. ''I reluctantly
accepted her resignation. She is a talented coach and we wish her
well in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Darsch's explanation for her resignation made no reference to
Holdsclaw, the Mystics much-celebrated No. 1 overall draft pick a
year ago. Holdsclaw, who likes to freelance, never seemed to warm
to the structured triangle offense used by Darsch.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Holdsclaw criticized Darsch after being benched
for the last few minutes of a loss to Sacramento, saying: ''I don't
play for the coaches, I play for my teammates. ... I think we'll
win basketball games with (Darsch), but I don't think we'll ever be
a great team. If we do, it will be because of us.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Melissa McFerrin, a longtime friend and
assistant under Darsch at Ohio State and with the WNBA's New York
Liberty, gathered Darsch and Holdsclaw together to patch things up.
But some friction within the team re-emerged Wednesday night when
Darsch questioned her players' maturity following a 81-58 loss to
expansion Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw didn't feel she was to blame for running the coach out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to handle that, because that was not the case,''
Holdsclaw said. ''I don't worry about what other people say,
because I know what the deal is. What happened between us was over
with. After two days, it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Darsch suffered through a personally difficult year in 1999. Her
mother died days before the season began and her brother had open
heart surgery, but she seemed fresh and revitalized when training
camp opened this year.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who will make his debut Saturday at home against
Charlotte, has coached in the NBA and CBA but has never coached a
women's team on any level. He was in Atlanta playing golf and
getting ready to do some scouting when Unseld called him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just a company guy, whatever they want me to do. I
couldn't turn it down,'' Walker said after practice. ''Once I got
on the court, I got excited.''

Jury Orders Tobacco Cos. Pay $145B
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- After a two-year trial, a jury took less than five hours today
to decide that the tobacco industry should pay a record-shattering $145 billion
in punitive damages to sick Florida smokers -- an amount industry lawyers
predicted would break the industry. Stock prices of the five companies were down
moderately following the ruling. The companies plan to appeal, and the verdict
will likely be tied up in the appeals process for years and is not expected to
have any immediate impact on the industry.

Jury: Govt. Not To Blame in Waco

<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- An advisory jury decided today that the government does
not bear responsibility for the deaths of 80 Branch Davidians during the cult's
1993 standoff with federal agents. A federal judge will deliver the final
verdict. The five jurors deliberated for 2&AMP;frac12; hours in the $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of
those who were killed. The trial, which lasted nearly a month, brought out
emotional testimony recounting the standoff from both sides.

Fiji Rebels Secure Political Power

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The rebels who ousted this Pacific nation's elected
leadership turned their weapons in Friday with a Fijian flourish, swapping
whale's teeth and asking for forgiveness a day after they ended an eight-week
hostage crisis. On Saturday, deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry made a
seemingly futile plea for his government to be reinstated and democracy
restored. Chaudhry's statements appeared certain to anger rebel leader George
Speight, who has warned a continuation of the unrest that has been sweeping the
country if anyone but his supporters are chosen to run the government.

Senate Passes Estate Tax Repeal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton promising a veto, Senate
Republicans muscled through a bill today that would gradually repeal inheritance
taxes originally imposed to prevent concentration of vast wealth in few hands.
Senators voted 59-39 to pass the ''death tax'' elimination bill, ignoring
Democratic arguments that it was a tax cut for the very richest Americans.
Sponsors portrayed the measure as a matter of basic fairness and a remedy for a
tax that punishes success, and most Republicans were joined by nine Democrats in
voting for it.

lawmaker is still a potential pick. Party sources have said the Missouri
lawmaker and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry appear to be the strongest candidates
to be Gore's choice, but Gephardt's staff worked today to dampen speculation.
Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and former Sen. George Mitchell of Maine round out
the top tier, with several other names still in the mix.

tourists and two carrying students, police said. A fourth bus, also holding

Baseball Owners Put Off Realignment

balanced schedule in 1977 and the National League followed in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Alex Rodriguez Put on DL  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- All-Star Alex Rodriguez was put on the 15-day
disabled list on Friday -- because of his right knee, not his head.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners decided to sit their shortstop after an MRI
exam showed he has a grade 2 sprain of his medial collateral
ligament. The move was retroactive to July 8, so he'll be eligible
to be activated on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez sustained a concussion on July 7 when he was hit in
the head by the knee of Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Alex Cora as
he attempted to break up a double play. He twisted his right knee
when he fell after the collision.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the Mariners were more concerned about the extent of
Rodriguez's knee injury than the concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great decision,'' an upbeat Rodriguez said after
hearing the results of the MRI. ''I'm very excited with the news.
Anytime you have a knee injury, there's always the chance it could
be season-ending or career-ending. I'll sit another 6-to-7 days,
and the time will fly by.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, counting Friday night's game against the San Diego
Padres, Rodriguez will miss nine more games before he can be
activated. He also missed the last two games before the All-Star
break, missed his start in the All-Star Game and sat out Thursday's
series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who is hitting .345 with 24 homers and 78 RBIs, is
still able to take batting practice and field ground balls, which
he did both Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I can play tonight or tomorrow,'' Rodriguez said.
''But there's no sense. I had the luxury of having the three days
off during the All-Star break, and after this, I'll be ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez missed 32 games early last season with torn meniscus
cartilage in his left knee that required arthroscopic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella was glad this injury won't require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could've been worse, but it certainly could've been
better,'' Piniella said. ''But the important thing is we'll have
Alex nice and healthy for the last 2&AMP;frac12; months.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides losing Rodriguez, the Mariners, who lead Oakland by
three games in the AL West, are also hamstrung offensively on this
six-game interleague trip since the designated hitter isn't used in
NL parks. Unless Edgar Martinez makes a spot start at first, the
most the Mariners will see of the best DH in baseball is a
pinch-hitting appearance each game, like in Thursday's 2-1,
10-inning loss to San Diego when he singled to extend his hitting
streak to 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is hitting .357, with a major league-leading 87 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a double-whammy,'' Piniella said. ''We'll just have to
make do and hopefully our other guys will step up.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen Thursday, when Rodriguez's replacement at
shortstop, Carlos Guillen, committed an error in the 10th inning
that allowed the winning run to score.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 8, Expos 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Gerald Williams homered for the
third straight game and Albie Lopez worked seven strong innings as
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Montreal Expos 8-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who went 2-for-5 with four RBIs, has driven in nine
runs in the past three games. He had a two-run single during a
three-run second inning and added a two-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Williams' 11th this season. He also hit a two-run
shot in Tampa Bay's 6-4 win over Montreal on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez (6-6) gave up two runs and eight hits for Tampa Bay, which
has won four of six.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens went 3-for-4 with a double and a solo homer for the
Expos. It was the 100th homer of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos (42-44) fell two-games under .500 for the first time
since opening the 2000 season with two consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Tony Armas (4-7) allowed seven runs and 10 hits in 5
2-3 innings. Armas has given up 11 runs over nine innings in his
past two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' 18th homer of the season, coming in the second inning,
gave the Expos an early lead for the second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case three times in Tampa Bay's win Thursday, the
Devil Rays responded in the bottom of the frame. Felix Martinez had
a sacrifice fly and Williams hit a two-run single to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays extended it to 4-1 in the third inning when Greg
Vaughn doubled and scored when Bubba Trammell hit into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bergeron's RBI grounder cut the Montreal deficit to 4-2 in
the fifth. However, the Devil Rays countered again in their half
when Steve Cox doubled and later scored on third baseman Mike
Mordecai's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' two-run homer made it 7-2 and knocked out Armas in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos hit into four double plays and went 1-for-11 with
runners in scoring positions.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal got within 8-4 in the eighth on run-scoring groundouts
by Jose Vidro and Vladimir Guerrero. Terry Jones added an RBI
double with two outs in the ninth before Roberto Hernandez came on
and got Bergeron to fly out for his 14th save in 19 chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Montreal OF Rondell White (right hamstring strain) was
placed on the 15-day DL, retroactive to July 8. INF Andy Tracy was
recalled from Triple-A Ottawa. ... Expos SS Orlando Cabrera left in
the third inning with a right shoulder sprain. ... Lopez is 6-1 in
22 career interleague games, including four starts. ... The Devil
Rays are 8-6 in interleague play. They won just nine times (9-25)
against NL teams in 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> Astros 9, Tigers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Chris Holt won for the first time since June 3
and Craig Biggio singled, doubled and tripled as the Houston Astros
defeated the Detroit Tigers 9-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman, Mitch Meluskey and Richard Hidalgo homered for
the Astros, who have won three of five, but just seven of their
last 25.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio was 3-for-5, scored once and drove in a run. Needing a
homer for the cycle in the eighth, he grounded out sharply to
third.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo also had three hits, scored three times and had two
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (4-10) allowed four runs on nine hits in 7 2-3 innings with
five strikeouts and two walks. He has a 1.84 ERA in five
appearances against AL teams the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson had three hits and two RBIs for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo (3-8) gave up nine hits, including two homers, and
six earned runs in 4 2-3 innings. He has won just one of his last
six decisions, and his ERA rose to 5.00.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Becker doubled and scored on Higginson's double before Dean
Palmer's RBI single gave the Tigers a 2-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers hit a two-out double and scored on Biggio's single
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros jumped ahead with a four-run fourth as Berkman led
off with his 13th home run, Hidalgo hit an RBI single, and Meluskey
added a two-run shot, his 10th homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio led off the fifth with a triple and scored on Moises
Alou's sacrifice fly. Two more runs scored on third baseman
Palmer's throwing error on Meluskey's infield single, putting
Houston up 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo hit a solo homer, his 24th, off Matt Anderson in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers chased Holt with a two-run eighth as Becker hit a
sacrifice fly before run-scoring singles from Higginson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Nomo has allowed 22 homers, tied for second-most in the AL
behind Kansas City's Jeff Suppan's 24. ... Meluskey's 10th home run
made him just the eighth Astros rookie with double-digit homers and
first since Jeff Bagwell hit 15 and Luis Gonzalez 13 in 1991. ...
The Tigers will retire former OF Willie Horton's uniform number 23
and unveil a statue of him prior to Saturday's game against the
Astros. The statue, located beyond the left-center field wall,
joins those of Tigers Hall of Famers Al Kaline, Hank Greenberg,
Charlie Gehringer, Ty Cobb and Hal Newhouser that were already in
place when Comerica Park opened in April. ... Bagwell scored his
1,000th career run in the fifth. Bagwell and Biggio are the only
players to score 1,000 runs for the Astros.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Arrive in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Three U.S. senators arrived Friday in Cuba on a
visit aimed at improving relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., led the delegation that included Sen.
Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said
authorities at the Interest Section of the United States in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said the delegation intends to address issues involved
in normalizing relations as well as show support for lifting a
trade embargo imposed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With Elian Gonzalez back in Cuba, Fidel Castro's government has
renewed a campaign against decades-old U.S. policies, like the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen are expected to hold a press conference Sunday
afternoon before their departure for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at the airport, the group was met by Vicky
Huddleston, head of the Interest Section in Cuba. Legislators
declined to comment, but aides said the legislators hoped to meet
with President Fidel Castro.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 6, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens, pitching for the first time since
beaning Mike Piazza, kept in control and won his third straight
start as the New York Yankees beat the Florida Marlins 6-2 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams and David Justice hit consecutive home runs in
the first inning off All-Star Ryan Dempster and Ryan Thompson later
connected for a three-run shot. The Marlins had won three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (7-6) had been caught in a swirl of controversy since
hitting Piazza in the helmet last Saturday night, knocking the Mets
catcher out of the final two games of the Subway Series and the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and the Mets claimed it was intentional. Clemens and the
Yankees insisted he needed to pitch inside to be successful and
said the beaning was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Yankees manager Joe Torre predicted Clemens
would be fine facing the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's had enough support on this side to not let all
the other stuff affect him,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens came close to just one Marlins batter. In the first
inning, he backed away Preston Wilson with a waist-high fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wound up walking in that at-bat, and hit a two-run homer
his next time up.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched seven innings and gave up seven hits, striking
out four and walking three. He has won three in a row for the first
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is 3-0 with a 2.11 ERA since coming off the disabled
list after being sidelined by a strained groin. His 254th victory
moved into a tie with Jack Morris and Red Faber for 35th place on
the career list.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won without second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who was
listed as day-to-day with a bruised left wrist and thumb after
being hit by a line drive Thursday night. His replacement, Jose
Vizcaino, got his 1,000th career hit.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster (9-6), who was selected for the All-Star game but did
not pitch, was tagged for six runs in six innings. In his only
other start at Yankee Stadium, he gave up three homers in 4 2-3
innings in a 1998 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a two-run homer, his 20th, and Justice followed
with his 23rd for a 3-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, promoted from the minors Thursday, connected in the
fourth for his first big league homer since last Sept. 7 with
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson hit his 20th home run in the third. In the fourth, the
Marlins thought they had scored the tying run when Clemens
seemingly balked with a runner on third base, but it was ruled that
time had been called.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo stole two bases in the first for Florida, giving
him a major league-leading 38. The Marlins swiped four in all, and
top the majors with 100.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Former Yankees captain Don Mattingly will take part in his
first Old-Timers Day game Saturday. ... Castillo has seven
multi-steal games this year. ... Denny Neagle, acquired Wednesday
from Cincinnati, joined the Yankees. He will pitch Monday night at
home against Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Pitcher Eldred Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- White Sox starter Cal Eldred, a key to the team's
standout season, left Friday night's game with the St. Louis
Cardinals in the fifth inning when he felt discomfort in his right
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who has a history of arm problems, walked to the side of
the mound after delivering a 2-1 pitch to Eduardo Perez and
couldn't continue after a meeting with manager Jerry Manuel and
trainer Herm Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred (10-2) had won eight straight decisions, not losing since
May 10. He won't get the decision Friday, leaving with the game
tied 2-2 and two outs in the fifth. Bill Simas relieved and got the
final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred threw 92 pitches Friday night and yielded a homer to Jim
Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred underwent ''Tommy John'' elbow ligament replacement
surgery in 1995 and missed most of that season and 1996, while with
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   He was traded this past offseason along with shortstop Jose
Valentin to the White Sox for Jaime Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred was 11-2 in his first full season with the Brewers in
1992 and then won 16 and 11 games the next two seasons before the
onset of elbow problems.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred bounced back to go 13-15 in 1997, but missed the last two
months of 1998 and the first month of 1999 with a small fracture of
the elbow. He went back on the DL last season with a forearm
strain.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old right-hander has been on the disabled list five

biggest surprises for the White Sox.

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Crystal Robinson made four free throws in
the final 11.3 seconds as the New York Liberty beat Orlando 55-51
Friday night, moving within a game of the first-place Miracle in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   After Robinson hit two free throws to put New York ahead 53-48,
the Liberty fouled Adrienne Johnson on a 3-point attempt and she
made all three free throws to pull Orlando within two points with
10.1 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was intentionally fouled again and hit two more free
throws with 9.5 seconds left. Johnson's last-second 3-point shot
fell short as New York won its fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson led New York with 15 points and Robinson and Tari
Phillips had 11 each. Phillips also had seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Johnson had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Miracle,
who shot 33.3 percent. Shannon Johnson had 10 points and seven
rebounds, but no other Orlando player reached double figures in
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Johnson's 3-pointer with 46.9 seconds remaining cut New
York's lead to 51-48. New York turned the ball over on its next
possession but the Miracle missed consecutive 3-point shots
starting at the 16.7-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   New York began the game on an 8-1 run before Orlando scored the
next 10 points to lead 11-8 with 10:41 left in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   New York responded with an 11-2 spurt to take a 19-13 lead with
4:39 remaining. However, the Miracle came back and trailed 24-23 at
halftime.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Lowers Own Swimming Record  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jenny Thompson lowered her own eight-year-old
American record in the 100-meter freestyle by 0.21 seconds Friday
night in the Janet Evans Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Peirsol, a 16-year-old from nearby Irvine, upset world
record-holder Lenny Krayzelburg to win the 200 backstroke. It was
Krayzelburg's first loss in his signature event in more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a final previewing next month's Olympic trials, Thompson won
in 54.27 seconds, bettering the mark of 54.48 she set in the 1992
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you'll see more good swims from me,'' she said. ''It
makes me feel really confident and positive about the next four
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Peirsol, who become the youngest man in history to break two
minutes last year, won in 1:59.01. Krayzelburg was overtaken in the
final 12 meters swimming in his home pool and finished second in
1:59.34. Brad Bridgewater, the '96 Olympic champion, was sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Aaron reel me in and I couldn't do anything. My arms
were so tired,'' Krayzelburg said. ''Sometimes you can have a bad
race. I'm not really that concerned. I know once I start resting,
I'll feel stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 100 free, Dara Torres also swam under Thompson's previous
record, finishing second in 54.47 after leading at the 25-meter
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''My initial reaction was I was bummed I lost, but it was my
best time by a half-second,'' she said. ''I tried to go out fast
and sort of try to hang on for dear life.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, is attempting to become the first American to swim
in four Olympics after a seven-year retirement that ended last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't rested yet, so I know it's going to go better,'' she
said. ''Those were really awesome times.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, a four-time gold medalist in the Atlanta
Olympics, was third in 55.76 as she attempts a comeback from
shoulder surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Peirsol and Krayzelburg have raced three times this summer, but
it was Peirsol's first win ever over his rival and the teen-ager's
second victory in a major meet in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a surprise. I wasn't coming in here with any high
expectations,'' Peirsol said. ''He didn't have one of his good
races. This will push us even harder at trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg labeled Peirsol as one of the favorites in Sydney.
The top two finishers in the trials, to be held Aug. 9-16 in
Indianapolis, earn Olympic berths.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's definitely for real,'' Krayzelburg said. ''When Aaron
touched the wall, he had this look on his face like I'm sorry I
beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Malchow of Ann Arbor, Mich., won the 200 butterfly in
1:55.84 -- 0.66 seconds off the world record he set in May.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Bedford of Colorado Springs, Colo., won the 200 backstroke
in 2:14.28. Bedford, 27, is aiming for a berth on her first Olympic
team after medaling in every other major meet.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stefanyshyn of Canada was second and '96 Olympic champion
Beth Botsford of Tucson, Ariz., was third with identical times of
2:15.88.
</P>
<P>
   In other events, Gustavo Borges of Brazil won the 100 free in 50
seconds, tying the meet record; Misty Hyman of Phoenix won the 200
butterfly in 2:09.68; Claudia Poll, a former Olympian from Costa
Rica, won the 400 free in 4:09.04; and Klete Keller of Phoenix won
the 400 free in 3:53.28.
</P>
<P>
   The meet continues through Sunday on the Southern California
campus.

<HEADLINE> Ruling May Help Former RNC Chief  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican Party waged a secret battle to
withhold documents from a Justice Department fund-raising
investigation of its former chairman, and won a court ruling Friday
that will keep the materials from a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Though the GOP has accused Democrats of stonewalling the
fund-raising investigation, an appeals court ruling disclosed that
Republicans have held up the prosecutors' investigation of former
party chairman Haley Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury in 1997 subpoenaed the files of the Republican
National Committee's former general counsel, seeking information on
efforts by Barbour and others to arrange a loan guarantee from a
Hong Kong businessman to help their efforts in the final days of
the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have alleged the transaction funneled illegal foreign
money into the U.S. election. Barbour has said he didn't know the
Hong Kong businessman used foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The former RNC general counsel argued the documents were
protected by attorney-client privilege, but a judge ordered him to
turn them over under the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client
privilege. After reviewing the documents, the judge concluded there
was evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court, however, sided with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said the loan guarantee Barbour arranged
didn't violate federal campaign finance laws and could not be used
to pierce the client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case does not fall within the crime-fraud exception
because what RNC and its officials are accused of is not
criminal,'' the judges ruled.
</P>
<P>
   RNC chairman Jim Nicholson said ''Haley and the RNC were well
within the limits of the law,'' contrasting their conduct with that
of ''Democrats with close ties to Al Gore'' who have been
''convicted of felonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said Democratic National Committee officials have been
making ''false charges ... about Mr. Barbour and the RNC'' and
should apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokesman Rick Hess said ''this
three-year legal battle by the Republicans shows that they will go
to any lengths and employ any tortured legalism to conceal the
foreign source of their funds.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a transaction between the National Policy Forum, a
group formed by Barbour, and Hong Kong businessman Ambrous Young.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1994 election, NPF had received a loan from
Republican political committees. As the election drew closer,
Barbour wanted to inject money into the GOP effort to gain control
of Congress and sought a way to have NPF repay the money it was
loaned so the GOP committee could use it to help candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour arranged a $2.1 million loan guarantee from Young, used
that to secure U.S. bank loan and paid back the money to the GOP
committee in time for them to use it for the election.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction was brought to light by Democrats during
congressional hearings into fund-raising abuses after the 1996
election. The Justice Department has been investigating the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the secret battle over the GOP lawyer's files
wasn't disclosed until Friday's appeals court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In its 3-0 ruling, the appeals court said the loan guarantee
went to the NPF, not the Republican Party, and therefore ''is no
violation'' of election laws. The court said it must defer to the
Federal Election Commission, which deadlocked on a 3-3 vote on
whether the transaction was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges included Reagan appointees Stephen Williams and
Douglas Ginsburg and Clinton appointee Judith Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling also details some of the previously
secret battle.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court judge had demanded that the RNC lawyer turn over
his files.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence shows that the RNC sought the advice of the
general counsel in an effort to construct the loan ... transaction
in a manner designed to conceal from the FEC the source of the
funds,'' the lower court concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC sought ''to evade federal election campaign laws,'' the
lower court judge concluded after reviewing the documents.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reserve Stephanie McCarty scored 16 points
as Indiana beat the Seattle Storm 64-45 Friday night, snapping the
Fever's eight-game home losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty had eight points during a 22-8 run in the second half as
Indiana (5-14) won at home for the first time since an 80-59
victory over Miami on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty shot 4-for-6 from the field -- including 3-for-4 on
3-pointers. Indiana, the league's best 3-point shooting team, shot
7-for-18 (39 percent) from behind the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Backup center Jurgita Streimikyte added 13 points and Monica
Maxwell had nine rebounds for the Fever.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Threatt scored 13 points and Quacy Barnes added 12 for
Seattle (3-18), which lost its fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty hit a 3-pointer, converted a fast-break layup and made
three free throws to lead the decisive eight-minute rally, which
pulled the Fever from a 30-29 deficit to a 51-38 lead with 4:10 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shot 35 percent (16-of-46) on field goals, and missed
all six of its 3-point attempts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Andy Ashby pitched a seven-hitter in his debut
with Atlanta and Andres Galarraga had three hits, including a
homer, as the Braves beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones also homered for the Braves, who improved to 4-7
against the Orioles since the inception of interleague play.
Atlanta is 4-1 in Baltimore and 0-6 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, obtained Wednesday in a trade with Philadelphia, walked
four and struck out six in his second complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (5-7) has won three straight starts, the last two against
the Orioles, and has yielded only four earned runs in his last 24
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore got three hits in the first inning and only four more
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Ponson (5-5) gave up three runs and six hits in seven
innings. He allowed both Atlanta home runs and has yielded 19 in 19
starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle had two hits and his 70th RBI for the Orioles and
Harold Baines hit two singles, giving him 1,600 hits as a
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were without manager Bobby Cox, who began serving a
five-game suspension for bumping umpire Derryl Cousins during a
July 4 game against Montreal. He was replaced by dugout coach Pat
Corrales.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta second baseman Quilvio Veras hurt his knee during a
first-inning rundown and left in the bottom of the fourth. He is
scheduled to have an MRI on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles got three hits and a walk in the first inning but
scored only one run. Delino DeShields was thrown out at third on an
RBI single by Belle and the inning ended with Belle tagged out
trying to score on a single by B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson held the Braves hitless until Jones hit his 23rd homer, a
two-out drive in the fourth inning that made it 1-1. Galarraga hit
No. 21 leading off the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga was credited with a double in the seventh when Belle
broke slowly on his sinking blooper to right. Wally Joyner then
singled and Javy Lopez hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga led off the ninth with a single off Alan Mills and was
replaced by pinch-runner Trenidad Hubbard, who scored on a single
by Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Atlanta is 18-2 in games in which Galarraga homers. ...
Braves CF Andruw Jones robbed Mike Bordick of a third-inning hit
with a sensational diving catch. ... Ponson's loss means the
Orioles do not have a starter with a winning record. ... It was
only the fifth game that Baltimore did not get an extra-base hit.

<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Homer Bush tied the game with his first homer of
the season, then Raul Mondesi won it with a game-winning grounder
in the bottom of the ninth as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the
Philadelphia Phillies 3-2 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley (1-3) gave up a one-out home run to Bush in the
ninth for his second blown save in 16 chances. It was Bush's first
homer since September 4 at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart followed with a single, and as he was attempting
to steal second, Craig Grebeck hit a single past second baseman
Mickey Morandini, who was trying to cover the bag, allowing Stewart
to reach third.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi followed with a groundball to third baseman Scott Rolen,
whose throw to the plate was not in time to get Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch (5-1) pitched the ninth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Randy Wolf allowed just one run in seven
innings, and has pitched at least six innings in 17 of 18 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old left-hander allowed nine hits, struck out five,
and walked two. He has not allowed a home run in his last four
starts after allowing at least one in 13 of his first 14 starts.
</P>
<P>
   With two runners in scoring position in the third inning, Wolf
struck out Carlos Delgado, who leads the AL with 29 home runs. In
the sixth, with two on and two outs, he struck out Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   With a runners on first and second and two outs in the seventh,
Ron Gant lined a sharp single to left off reliever John Frascatore.
Stewart charged the ball, but it kicked off his glove, allowing
Desi Relaford to score the go-ahead run without a throw.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto starter Kelvim Escobar pitched six innings of three-hit
ball before being replaced in the seventh. Escobar was a
last-minute replacement for Frank Castillo, who couldn't start
because of a tender elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took a 1-0 lead in the fourth after Rolen walked
and scored on Mike Lieberthal's double.
</P>
<P>
   After Wolf allowed a walk and a single in the bottom half,
Alberto Castillo hit an RBI grounder to tie it.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Gant broke an 0-for-15 slump with a homer in Thursday's 8-5
win. ... The Phillies placed RHP Wayne Gomes on the 15-day disabled
list with tendinitis in his right elbow. Gomes was 4-4 with a 3.31
ERA in a team-leading 43 appearances. The Phillies recalled RHP
Mark Brownson from Triple A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take Gomes'
place. Brownson was 7-6 with a 4.89 ERA in 16 starts. ... Toronto
manager Jim Fregosi said SS Alex Gonzalez should be able to play in
3-6 days. Gonzalez has missed 10 games with a strained right groin.
... Attendance was 21,385. ... The Blue Jays' female mascot
''Diamond'' quit because the job took too much of a toll on her
body. The Blue Jays are currently auditioning replacements.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his 24th homer and Jon Lieber
pitched seven scoreless innings to win his fourth straight start as
the Chicago Cubs beat the Minnesota Twins 6-2 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber (9-5) was in control from the start, allowing just a
leadoff single to Cristian Guzman over the first 5 2-3 innings. At
one point he retired 14 straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber allowed four hits, three walks and struck out five. He
has given up only two runs in his last 25 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins came close to scoring in the sixth and seventh innings
by putting men on first and second with two outs. Both times,
Lieber got out of the jam on a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's home run, a 453-foot shot off Eric Milton (8-5) in the
second inning, was his 360th career homer.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill followed Sosa with a home run of his own, and
drove in another run in the third on an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored three more in the sixth on a run-scoring single
by Joe Girardi and a two-run double by Mark Grace.
</P>

done that this season -- second most in the majors. ... In three
July starts, Milton is 0-3 with a 10.05 ERA. ... Lieber has a

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Dreamaster edged Dream Vacation by
a nose Friday night in the $380,000 Beacon Course trot, the final
major tuneup before the Hambletonian.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamaster appeared to be trapped on the rail going into the
final turn, but made a bold move between horses coming down the
stretch. He took the lead just before the wire and won in 1:54 2-5.
Legendary Lover K was third, followed by Credit Winner.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamaster, who won for the fifth time in as many starts this
year, paid $9.60, $4.80 and $3.20.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just hoping I could get away in the middle of the pack
with cover,'' said Dreamaster's driver, Dave Magee. ''There was
plenty of pace up front so I felt comfortable coming up gradually.
I didn't see Dream Vacation until he got close to us. I was just
concerned with my horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamaster's trainer, Dirk Simpson, said he wasn't sure if the
son of Victory Dream had won the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was right here in the winner's circle,'' Simpson said. ''It
looked like (Dream Vacation) got up in the last step. I was happy
to see our number come up.''
</P>

Tobacco Industry Told To Pay $145B
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A jury took less than five hours today to decide that the
tobacco industry should pay a record-shattering $145 billion in punitive damages
to sick Florida smokers -- an amount industry lawyers predicted would break the
industry. Stock prices of the five companies were down moderately following the
two-year ruling. The companies plan to appeal, and the verdict will likely be
tied up in the appeals process for years and is not expected to have any
immediate impact on the industry.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- An advisory jury decided today that the government does
not bear responsibility for the deaths of 80 Branch Davidians during the cult's
1993 standoff with federal agents. A federal judge will deliver the final
verdict. The five jurors deliberated for 2&AMP;frac12; hours in the $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of
those who were killed. The trial, which lasted nearly a month, brought out
emotional testimony recounting the standoff from both sides.

   HAVANA (AP) -- Three U.S. senators arrived Friday in Cuba on a visit aimed at
improving relations between the two countries. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., led the
delegation that included Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Pat Roberts,
R-Kan., said authorities at the Interest Section of the United States in Havana.
The aides said the delegation intends to address issues involved in normalizing

Senate Passes Estate Tax Repeal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton promising a veto, Senate
Republicans muscled through a bill today that would gradually repeal inheritance
taxes originally imposed to prevent concentration of vast wealth in few hands.
Senators voted 59-39 to pass the ''death tax'' elimination bill, ignoring
Democratic arguments that it was a tax cut for the very richest Americans.
Sponsors portrayed the measure as a matter of basic fairness and a remedy for a
tax that punishes success, and most Republicans were joined by nine Democrats in
voting for it.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a top prospect to be

pick somebody else, according to Democratic officials who say the Missouri
lawmaker is still a potential pick. Party sources have said the Missouri
lawmaker and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry appear to be the strongest candidates
to be Gore's choice, but Gephardt's staff worked today to dampen speculation.
Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and former Sen. George Mitchell of Maine round out
the top tier, with several other names still in the mix.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 4, Royals 0  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeff D'Amico allowed three hits in seven
shutout innings and Jose Hernandez drove in three runs, leading
Milwaukee past Kansas City 4-0 Friday night, the Royals' ninth loss
in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico (5-4) struck out four, walked two and did not allow a
hit until Mike Sweeney lined a soft single into left field with two
outs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   With his third straight victory, D'Amico lowered his ERA from
2.45 to 2.16 in 58 1-3 innings while allowing only one runner as
far as third. If he pitched enough innings to be listed among the
league leaders, his ERA would be second in the NL, behind only
Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals threatened with two on and two outs in the sixth, but
D'Amico got Jermaine Dye to fly out to deep center.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki (4-4), 0-3 in eight starts at home, gave up two runs
and nine hits in seven innings, walked two and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had an RBI double in the fourth and added his 11th
homer in the eighth, a two-run shot off Jose Santiago as the
Brewers won for the fifth time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the fourth, Charlie Hayes moved from second to
third on Suzuki's wild pitch, then scored on Hernandez's double.
Raul Casanova followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Each team had players leave the game with apparent illness.
After the second inning, Royals center fielder Johnny Damon was
taken out with what the team said were flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Then second baseman Ron Belliard left the game on wobbly feet
after doubling in Milwaukee's fifth. The Brewers said he was
experiencing dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth shutout loss of the season for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kansas City's Mark Quinn made a fine play in left field in
the fifth, backing into the padded wall to catch Henry Blanco's
drive. ... Quinn leads AL rookies with 12 home runs. ... Suzuki had
an embarrassing moment in the fifth when he wheeled around to throw
to second on a pickoff attempt, but tripped over the rubber and
nearly threw the ball away as he tried to catch his balance. ...
Since 1996, the Brewers are 13-5 in Kansas City. ... When they
score first, the Brewers are 30-16.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary Revives Kennedy Story  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The driftwood memorial has long since disappeared
from the beach where -wreckage from John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane
washed ashore. And most of the questions about why the Piper
Saratoga crashed off Martha's Vineyard a year ago -- killing him,
his wife and her sister -- have been answered.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends plan no public tribute to mark the first
anniversary of their July 16, 1999 deaths, and police on Martha's
Vineyard say they don't expect a throng of the Kennedy-curious to
gather in remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, perhaps the only sign that a year has passed is the
media bonanza accompanying the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome face of the president's son graces at least a
half-dozen magazine and tabloid covers this week, and books have
hit store shelves to coincide with the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy chroniclers are sharing their insights on the morning
news show circuit, and ''never-before-seen'' photographs of Kennedy
in his college days adorn the cover of US magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Though some publishers were initially reluctant to commission
books on Kennedy after he died, for fear of a negative backlash,
there are now at least five books out on his life, with two more in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Anderson is author of ''The Day John Died,'' a book
released this week. He says America is captivated by Kennedy
because of a powerful collective memory of the death of his father
36 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''The salute -- the salute says it all,'' Anderson said,
referring to the gesture the young Kennedy gave to his father's
casket at the president's funeral in 1963. ''The most heartbreaking
moment in modern political times was the moment he gave that
salute.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also writes that Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, in the latter years of her life, had a recurring
premonition her son would be killed piloting his own plane.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, died along with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette. They were en route
from New Jersey to the wedding of his cousin when Kennedy
apparently became disoriented and plunged the plane into the ocean,
according to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Martha's Vineyard remembered Kennedy and the
anniversary of his death in their own private ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone remembers him,'' said Bill Searle, a leader
of the Dukes County Search and Rescue team that was involved in the
search and recovery of the plane's debris. ''He was just a
down-to-earth regular joe.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to be reminded or have a memorial. We just
know,'' said Anne McGhee, a professor in Harvard University's
architecture department who has a home in the area. ''Personally, I
feel sad because it was like he was one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bessette family said in a statement it did not plan to mark
the day with a service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loss of these three young people whom we loved so much has
forever altered our lives,'' the statement read. ''We continue to
struggle with our grief and we choose to maintain what is left of
our privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Kennedys -- perhaps the most public of American
families -- said they would keep their activities of the day
private.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a day goes by that we don't think of John and Carolyn and
Lauren and all they meant to us. We miss them dearly and we always
will,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said in a statement. ''We
are deeply moved by the thoughts and prayers and warm condolences
we have continued to receive from those across the country whose
lives they touched.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will never forget the joy and love and laughter and
inspiration they brought to us, and those beautiful memories
provide special comfort to us now on this heartbreaking
anniversary,'' said Kennedy, John Jr.'s uncle who was expected to
spend the weekend at his home in Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   The John F. Kennedy Library in Boston also does not plan to mark
the anniversary, according to spokesman Tom McNaught. He noted the
library marks the birthdays of the family members, not the
anniversaries of their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the Kennedy family chooses to celebrate family members
is during their lives,'' McNaught said.

<HEADLINE> Officer Denounces Venezuelan Leader  </HEADLINE>
By FABIOLA SANCHEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- An air force colonel was arrested
Friday after accusing President Hugo Chavez of illegally using
patriotic symbols in his re-election bid, the second active
military officer to publicly denounce the Venezuelan leader in less
than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The comments come amid reports that Chavez might be losing
support in the armed forces ahead of presidential elections slated
for July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after appearing before the National Electoral Council to
complain about Chavez, Col. Silvino Bustillos was detained at the
air force headquarters in the capital of Caracas, said his lawyer,
retired Col. Hidalgo Valero.
</P>
<P>
   Bustillos criticized ''unfair advantages by the president'' and
said Chavez was using the national anthem, the Venezuelan flag and
other patriotic symbols in violation of electoral law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Capt. Luis Garcia Morales was kicked out of the
National Guard for publicly calling for Chavez's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, midlevel officers, not the top brass, have been
behind many of the conspiracies to overthrow governments in
Venezuela. Chavez himself was a lieutenant colonel when he staged
his coup attempt in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Isaias Rodriguez told reporters Friday the
officers' comments did not signal widespread discontent with Chavez
in the armed forces. He called the denunciations ''isolated cases''
that have an ''electoral end.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper, is up for re-election because
of a new constitution he pushed through last year that requires
most public offices to be ''re-legitimized'' through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   His main challenger, Francisco Arias, is also a former military
officer who helped him stage the 1992 coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in February 1999, Chavez has vastly
increased the role of the military in Venezuelan society, using
soldiers to fix roads and refurbish hospitals, and filling senior
government posts with generals.
</P>
<P>
   While Chavez remains popular among Venezuela's poor majority,
his critics argue that a democracy cannot coexist with the
militarization of civilian institutions.

<HEADLINE> Indians 9, Pirates 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chuck Finley had an All-Star performance and
rookie Russell Branyan drove in four runs to lead the Cleveland
Indians past the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (8-6) allowed two runs and five hits over seven innings
in his first outing since being the only AL All-Star not to play in
his team's 6-2 victory over the NL in Atlanta on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, signed as a free agent last winter after 14
years with the Angels, improved to 5-1 with a 2.33 ERA at Jacobs
Field this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young hit solo homers in the fourth and ninth innings for
Pittsburgh. It was his fifth multihomer game in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Branyan hit a three-run home run to put Cleveland ahead in the
second inning and had a sacrifice fly during a five-run fifth. It
was the third time this season that Branyan had four RBIs in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez opened the second inning with a single to left and
went to second on Jim Thome's single to right. Branyan then hit a
high fly ball for his 12th homer, 432 feet to center for a 3-0 lead
off Kris Benson (8-7).
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh made it 3-1 in the third on an RBI groundout by Jason
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Young pulled Pittsburgh within 3-2 in the fourth by lining his
14th homer into the stands in right-center. He homered again to
nearly the same spot leading off the ninth against Justin Speier.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland restored its two-run lead in the bottom of the fourth.
Travis Fryman doubled, went to third on a wild pitch, and scored on
Kenny Lofton's broken-bat, bloop single to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians went ahead 9-2 with a five-run fifth that began with
three straight singles, included sacrifice flies by Fryman and
Branyan, and was capped by Sandy Alomar's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jeff Wallace hit one batter, walked another, and threw
a wild pitch to fuel the rally.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rain delayed the start 1 hour, 23 minutes. ... Finley
struck out four, giving him a total of 2,269 to pass Hall of Famer
Lefty Grove for 37th on the career list. ... Lofton improved to
20-for-56 (.357) with runners in scoring position. ... Branyan has
10 homers in 44 at-bats at Jacobs Field this season. ... Finley was
the fourth left-handed starter the Pirates faced in the last six
games. Overall, Pittsburgh is 11-14 against lefty starters. ...
Young's homer extended his hitting streak to 13 games.

<HEADLINE> For disabled relay team, 22{-mile swim is just another challenge  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - One is blind. One lost his leg at age
18. One was born without feet. The other grew up with polio.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, this unlikely relay team will attempt the
unbelievable - swimming 22&AMP;frac12; miles around this casino capital,
fighting ocean waves, rushing tides and the occasional stinging
jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
   The foursome, the first disabled athletes ever to compete in the
Around the Island Marathon Swim, say they're doing it to show
others with handicaps that very little is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely incredible, the persistence that these
athletes show,'' said race director Sid Cassidy. ''That they are
willing to challenge the world's toughest marathon swim is an
inspiration to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The team captain is Mike Doyle, 44, of Warrington, Pa., an
electrical designer for a shipbuilder, who lost his right leg in a
motorcycle accident when he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   The others are:
</P>
<P>
   -Jason Wening, 25, of Ann Arbor, Mich., a graduate student in
biomedical engineering, who was born without ankles or feet.
</P>
<P>
   -John Morgan, 38, of Highland Falls, N.Y., a linguistics expert
who lost his sight at age 18 in a freak accident while exercising.
He was using stretch bands attached to springs and when bands
snapped, flinging the springs into his face and damaging his
retinas.
</P>
<P>
   -David English, 49, of Audubon, Pa., an equipment leasing
company employee who was stricken with polio as a child and has a
withered left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like sending the message to people, especially to the
recently disabled: Don't let the disability stop you,'' said
English. ''You can get out and achieve stuff. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran swimmers all, the four got to know each other competing,
in the Paralympics and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Around the Island Swim, which started in 1954 as a $200 bet
between two lifeguards, seemed like the ultimate challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But Wening, a disabled world record-holder who swims seven miles
a day, likes open water because it neutralizes his handicap. In
pool swimming, he loses time because he's unable to perform flip
turns against the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer I swim, the less it matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan relishes the opportunity to stop counting while he swims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I swim everyday in the pool, but I have to count every stroke
so I don't hit the wall,'' said Morgan. ''That, to me, is not
swimming. It's counting. I like to swim out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the only member of the team who needs special assistance.
Since his Seeing Eye Dog, James, can't direct him, Morgan hopes to
wear a transmitter inside his bathing cap that can be used to tell
him when he's swimming off-course.
</P>
<P>
   But the transmitter wasn't working Friday, when the team warmed
up in the fourth annual Disabled Invitational Open Water Swim, a
five-kilometer swim through the back bays.
</P>
<P>
   So Doyle rigged up a device to keep Morgan on the straight and
narrow. It was a portable lane line, built of styrofoam lane
noodles and suspended from the back of a kayak to form a floating
U-shaped enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   When Morgan felt his arm hit one of the noodles, he would adjust
his course and continue. But that wasn't perfect, either. Morgan
swam too fast for the teen-age volunteers piloting the kayak.
</P>
<P>
   ''John will be up the kayak's butt,'' said a worried Doyle. ''It
won't go fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The four hope to go fast enough to keep pace with some of the
women's relay teams that compete in the race, which typically takes
about seven hours to complete.
</P>
<P>
   They will be accompanied by a motorboat and a kayak. The people
in the boats, meanwhile, may have to tote umbrellas: The forecast
called for rain.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers planned to go ahead with the race, unless there
is lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's just plain old rain, well, they're wet anyway, so it
won't matter,'' said race spokeswoman Lauralee Dobbins. ''This is
just not an event you can postpone.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Secure Political Power  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The rebels who ousted this Pacific nation's
elected leadership turned their weapons in Friday with a Fijian
flourish, swapping whale's teeth and asking for forgiveness a day
after they ended an eight-week hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry made a
seemingly futile plea for his government to be reinstated and
democracy restored.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the first news conference since his Thursday release
along with 17 other legislators after two months of captivity,
Chaudhry called for the ''reinstatement of the legitimate,
democratically elected ... government.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vocal and violent minority holds the whole country ransom,''
Chaudhry, with a fresh shave and haircut, told reporters gathered
on the lawn of his home.
</P>
<P>
   The statements appeared certain to anger rebel leader George
Speight, who has warned a continuation of the unrest that has been
sweeping the country if anyone but his supporters are chosen to run
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Chaudhry's verbal broadside, the crisis sparked by the
rebel coup appeared to be dissipating. Roadblocks began vanishing
from main streets, and protesters occupying police stations and
other government facilities doffed their masks and went home.
</P>
<P>
   Now come the nuts and bolts of rebel leader George Speight's
plan: Doing away with democracy in favor of guaranteed superiority
for indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his rebels, who began the crisis by storming
Parliament on May 19 and seizing several dozen members of the
government, are ethnic Fijians. They said the nation's large ethnic
Indian minority had too much power, and during negotiations they
got what they wanted -- the scrapping of the multiracial
constitution and the ouster of Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first
ethnic Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Having won those concessions -- along with immunity -- from the
military leaders who took over during the standoff, the rebels
freed their remaining 18 hostages Thursday. That cleared the way
for the Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's traditional power, to begin
appointing new government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs approved Speight supporter Ratu Jope Seniloli as vice
president Friday. That move came a day after they named Speight
nominee Ratu Josefa Iloilo president. Iloilo is expected to fill
the new Cabinet with Speight supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels maintained pressure on the chiefs Friday, issuing
thinly veiled threats that the civil disturbances which have
wracked the country in the past week could continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get into power, we will call off the dogs,'' rebel
spokesman Jo Nata told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   The coup has left Fiji a vastly changed nation. International
condemnation is piling up; sanctions loom. The tourist industry is
in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians, disenfranchised and despondent, are trying to
regroup amid growing emigration that is sure to cut their 44
percent share of the population. In the days after Parliament's
seizure, Speight supporters looted and burned ethnic Indian homes
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs council chairman Sitiveni Rabuka, a former military
officer who led two coups in 1987 and later was elected prime
minister, said Fiji has been badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wins a coup,'' he told reporters. ''The whole nation
suffers. He (Speight) is free to enjoy his self-perceived
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential troubles ahead, there was a palpable sense
of relief as the rebels handed in their weapons Friday, trading
whale's teeth with the chiefs and performing a ceremony asking
forgiveness from them.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 1,000 people who gathered at the Parliament complex
to watch were allowed to go in groups of 15 to see the guns. They
were displayed in the same room where the ethnic Indian hostages
had been kept.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big step forward in security and returning law and
order to the country,'' military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo
Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said his campaign will not be complete until his men are
in power.
</P>
<P>
   He told Australia's Nine Network TV that any attempt to restore
multiracial democracy would result in ''the same resistance we
showed to the army of this country.''

   WACO, Texas (AP) -- An advisory jury decided Friday that the
government does not bear responsibility for the deaths of 80 Branch
Davidians during the cult's 1993 standoff with federal agents. A
federal judge will deliver the final verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The five jurors deliberated for 2&AMP;frac12; hours in the $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians and
relatives of those who were killed. The trial, which lasted nearly
a month, brought out emotional testimony recounting the standoff
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith, who will take the jury's
findings under advisement, said he would render his verdict soon,
possibly in August. He will also consider perhaps the most
contentious issue -- whether federal agents shot at the Davidians at
the end of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contended that the government should shoulder
some blame for the botched raid that started the 51-day standoff
and the final day of the siege, when the cult's compound went up in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury found that the government did not use excessive
force during the raid and was not negligent by driving tanks into
the compound on the final day. The jurors also had been asked
whether agents contributed to or spread the fires or violated a
directive to have firefighting equipment at the site, which was
known as Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a vast majority of the American public will take this
as the final word,'' said Michael Caddell, lead counsel for the
plaintiffs. ''For most people that will be the finish to Mount
Carmel.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said late Friday that he doesn't plan to file any more
briefs to support his plaintiffs' claims in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given what's happened in Waco with Judge Smith, we don't see
the point. It's a lost cause. Judge Smith obviously has an agenda.
At some point, it simply becomes futile,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended that federal agents were ambushed by
heavily armed Davidians in the raid and that suicidal members of
the group set the fires themselves on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their defense, government attorneys played audio
tapes made inside the compound in which unidentified Branch
Davidians were heard asking ''Start the fire?'' and ''Should we
light the fire?''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a male voice could be heard saying, ''Let's keep
that fire going,'' as tanks rumbled in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ''This terrible tragedy was the responsibility of David Koresh
and the Branch Davidians, not the federal government,'' the Justice
Department said in a statement after the decision was announced.
''We are pleased the jury affirmed that view.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyer Ramsey Clark, who was attorney general during
Lyndon Johnson's administration, said in closing arguments Friday
that the deaths of the cult members ''didn't have to happen'' and
called the siege ''the greatest domestic law enforcement tragedy in
the history of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the conduct of the ATF and the FBI was performed without
excessive force and without negligence, then how in the world did
it end up with such unmitigated, disastrous effects?'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The siege began on Feb. 28, 1993, when Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents tried to search the complex and arrest Koresh, the
cult's leader, on illegal weapons charges. Six Davidians and four
ATF agents were killed in the ensuing shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended 51 days later with the deaths of some 80 men,
women and children inside the compound from either gunshots or from
the flames that quickly engulfed the building hours into a
tear-gassing operation designed to end the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell cited government documents that he said proves agents
deviated from their planned tear-gassing operation and put innocent
people inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the inferno at the end of the siege have made Waco a
one-word rallying cry for critics of the government, who have
claimed the government covered up aspects of its role.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FBI recanted earlier denials and acknowledged
that federal agents fired one or more incendiary tear gas rounds
during the standoff; a documentary researcher had found potentially
incendiary devices among the evidence stored in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed former
Missouri Sen. John Danforth as special counsel to resolve
unanswered questions about the siege.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Danforth, Jan Diltz, would not comment on
Friday's decision, nor would she speculate on when Danforth might
conclude his probe.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh said the jury's conclusion lifted ''an
enormous burden'' from law enforcement officers involved with the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a lot of speculation, misinformation and
second-guessing over the past seven years,'' Freeh said in a
statement, ''and I am grateful that this trial and other actions by
the court allowed the allegations to be aired and the facts to be
proved.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Doyle, who was one of nine people who escaped the inferno
and is one of the plaintiffs in the wrongful-death case, maintained
that the government's version of what happened in 1993 in untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would've been surprised if the jury ruled in favor of us,''
he said. ''It's kind of like the Kennedy assassination. You have
the official version and you have what everybody else believes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his 475th career home run
in the bottom of the first inning on Friday night to move into an
18th place tie on the career list with Stan Musial and Willie
Stargell.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit a 3-2 pitch from Oakland's Kevin Appier into the
deepest part of Pac Bell Park, clearing the 421-foot sign in right
center field. The homer, which traveled an estimated 442 feet, gave
the Giants a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bonds' 30th home run of the season, which moved him into
a tie with St. Louis' Mark McGwire, Cincinnati's Ken Griffey, Jr.,
and Los Angeles' Gary Sheffield for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds was greeted by his son, 9-year-old Nikolai, at home plate.

<HEADLINE> Putin Tries His Hand as Cannoneer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIZHNY TAGIL, Russia (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin, who has
flown in a jet fighter and sailed on submarines during his visits
to Russia's provinces, tried his hand Friday at firing heavy
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, assisted by local governor Eduard Rossel, yanked on a
cord to fire a 1938-vintage howitzer to signal the start of a
military parade at the Ural-Expo-Arms-2000 show. The exposition is
showing off weapons and equipment from some 200 defense enterprises
in 22 regions of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been embroiled in a dispute with regional governors
over his plan to deprive them of their seats in the upper house of
parliament, but has been careful to maintain at least the
appearance of cordial relations.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to Rossel, governor of the Sverdlovsk region, and
beckoned to him to help him fire the gun before television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to weaken the governor's authority,'' Putin said
later at a meeting of Ural regional leaders. ''But the weakening of
the federal center must be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The show in the town of Nizhny Tagil near Yekaterinburg, 900
miles east of Moscow, is a chance for the Russian weapons industry
to showcase its wares for potential foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's arms industry is struggling to find customers to make
up for a lack of orders from the government, which has little money
for major weapons purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall go on selling our arms,'' said Putin. ''Russian
weapons are second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Russia exported $2.8 billion worth of weapons, with the
figure rising to $3.4 billion in 1999 and expected to reach $4.3
billion this year, Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Neagle Sounds Happy To Join Yanks  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Denny Neagle got a crash course in Yankees
history the moment he walked into the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Neatly folded in his locker Friday was a gray T-shirt, featuring
the New York logo and three words -- Pride, Tradition and Courage.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle held up the shirt and studied it for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kid growing up wouldn't dream about playing in the
pinstripes?'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Traded by Cincinnati this week, Neagle was delayed by bad
weather in getting to Yankee Stadium. His original flight earlier
in the day from Denver, where the Reds were playing Colorado, was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   But Neagle, one of baseball's more colorful characters, was not
daunted. He arrived about 2&AMP;frac12; hours before a game against the
Florida Marlins, called his mom on a cellphone, greeted a few
teammates and got a pat on the back from manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Known for making kooky noises, he even unleashed a favorite
sound effect in an interview room -- a deafening, dead-on imitation
of a train whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was very impressive,'' general manager Brian Cashman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a tape of Neagle's performance began circulating
in the Yankees clubhouse, drawing laughs and smiles. And several of
the players -- many did not know him by sight when he walked in --
agreed that Neagle might be a nice fit.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time World Series champions project a business-like
manner on and off the field. Neagle's personality could be a
pleasant addition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll have to learn who I can kid and who I should leave
alone,'' Neagle said.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle already found a familiar problem for many new Yankees
arrivals -- picking a number that wasn't already taken or retired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wore 15 with Cincinnati, but that was Thurman Munson's
number. So I got on the computer with my wife and some friends and
started looking for another one,'' the pitcher said. ''I kind of
like low numbers, so I tried 16 and saw that was Whitey Ford's.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, for now, will wear No. 41. That belonged to pitcher Ed
Yarnall, one of four prospects the Yankees traded to the Reds on
Wednesday for Neagle and minor league outfielder Mike Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle admitted he might try to change it before he makes his
Yankees' debut Monday night at home against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, you'll see me pitch the most important number --
seven or eight innings,'' the former 20-game winner said.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle also hopes he'll have no trouble feeling comfortable on
the mound, in the clubhouse and in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was traded from Pittsburgh to Atlanta in 1996, I
pressed a little bit,'' he said. ''I got to the Braves and it was
the Fab Five rotation and Cy Youngs across the board. At first, I
was kind of like, 'There's Greg Maddux, there's Tom Glavine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle settled in neatly there, and pitched for the Braves in
the World Series loss to the Yankees that year. Now, he's on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to it. The crazy fans, all the culture. My
wife can't wait to go out there shopping and seeing some Broadway
shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ''The thing I'm excited about is that he's
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle watched Friday night as New York beat the Marlins 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of weird, sitting in this stadium and knowing I
was playing for the Yankees now,'' he said. ''But just going out to
the bullpen to throw before the game, it was great hearing the fans
cheer for you. It definitely beats having them yell at you when
you're on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old lefty was 8-2 with a 3.52 ERA for the Reds this
season. He's 98-62 for Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Minnesota and the Reds,
and his best season was 1997 when he went 20-5 with a 2.97 ERA for
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a good, dependable pitcher in a lot of places. He
should help us,'' said second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who broke
into the majors with Neagle for the Twins in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle is eligible for free agency at the end of the season and
''I'd be foolish not to listen to any offers from the Yankees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, sitting next to Cashman, Neagle sounded his train
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does that cost extra?'' the startled GM asked, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first one's free,'' Neagle said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 9, White Sox 4  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Suddenly, the Chicago White Sox's big lead in the
AL Central is looking a lot less secure.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford delivered a go-ahead seventh-inning triple, Eduardo
Perez hit St. Louis' club-record eighth grand slam this season, and
Garrett Stephenson pitched eight strong innings Friday night as the
Cardinals sent Chicago to its fourth straight loss, 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who led by 10&AMP;frac12; games at the All-Star break, have
lost two games off their lead in the two games since.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the White Sox match their longest losing streak of
the season, they watched one of their best pitchers, Cal Eldred,
leave in the fifth inning because of a sore elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, a 10-game winner who has a history of arm problems,
departed after throwing a pitch to Perez with two outs in the fifth
when he felt discomfort in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who underwent elbow ligament replacement surgery in
1995, has been on the DL five times since that season, but was
healthy and one of the White Sox's biggest surprises.
</P>
<P>
   He got his fourth no-decision Friday night -- and third straight
-- during a two-month stretch in which he's 8-0. He hasn't lost
since May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson (10-5), who started the season 8-0, but lost five of
his previous six decisions, got the victory, allowing six hits,
including Frank Thomas' two-run homer in the first. Stephenson
struck out two and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wunsch (3-3) hit Fernando Tatis with a pitch to start the
seventh before Lankford tripled into the right-field corner to give
the Cardinals a 3-2 lead. Eric Davis followed with a pinch-hit
single for a two-run cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Davis drew a bases-loaded walk off Bobby Howry to put St. Louis
up 5-2 in the eighth, and then Perez -- activated Thursday when Mark
McGwire went on the DL -- drove his first homer of the season to
center in his fifth at-bat to make it 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko's RBI single off Alan Benes and Chris Singleton's
sacrifice fly against Dave Veres in the ninth cut it to 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' 27th homer allowed him to pass Luke Appling as the White
Sox's career RBI leader. Appling set the previous club record of
1,116 from 1930-50 in 2,422 games. Thomas needed just 1,459 games
to overtake him.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals cut it to 2-1 in the third on a hit batsman, an
error by Chicago second baseman Ray Durham and Lankford's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds hit his 26th homer to tie it 2-2 in the fifth, and
three batters later, Eldred left after delivering a 2-1 pitch to
Perez. He stepped off the mound and couldn't continue after meeting
with manager Jerry Manuel and trainer Herm Schneider.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Perez's grand slam was the Cards' second in two nights.
Shawon Dunston had one Thursday night in a 13-5 rout. The previous
team record of seven slams in a season was set in 1961. ...
Stephenson is the Cardinals' third 10-game winner, joining Darryl
Kile and Andy Benes. ... Tatis, who homered twice Thursday night,
was twice hit by pitches Friday. ... NBA free agent Eddie Jones,
being recruited by the Chicago Bulls, threw out the first pitch.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador: Allies Urge Mahuad Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Political allies of former President Jamil
Mahuad said Friday that he should return home to face charges that
he illegally froze bank accounts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court President Galo Pico issued arrest warrants for
Mahuad and former Finance Minister Ana Lucia Armijos on Thursday in
connection with criminal charges that they exceeded their
constitutional authority when they partially froze private bank
accounts in March 1999 in an attempt to save Ecuador's collapsing
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, who was forced from office in January following a
military-backed uprising, is in the United States. Local newspaper
reports said Armijos is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of depositors were told they would have to
wait a year before they could withdraw their money.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Jose Gallardo, Mahuad's former defense minister,
said the deposed president should return and ''defend his honor''
and explain ''the reasons that existed for taking these economic
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Jose Pons, president of Congress and a member of Mahuad's
Christian Democracy party, said ''the interest of the court should
be that he come to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking office in August 1998, Mahuad inherited the worst
economic crisis to face Ecuador since the 1930s. A political
centrist, he faced resistance from leftist unions and social
movements that opposed cutting subsidies for social programs and a
conservative business sector that opposed tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was forced from office on Jan 21, Mahuad was widely
condemned for bailing out 18 failed banks last year at a cost of
$1.2 billion after the bankers stole the funds and fled abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After the short-lived military coup, Mahuad was replaced by his
vice president, Gustavo Noboa, who has largely carried on with
Mahuad's economic programs, including a plan to convert Ecuador to
an all-U.S. dollar economy.

   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Linebacker Richard Harvey, who spent the last
two seasons with the AFC West rival Oakland Raiders, agreed to a
two-year deal with the San Diego Chargers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is worth a little more than $1 million, with

</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't hidden our desire to find a veteran linebacker,''
Chargers player personnel director Billy Devaney said. ''It doesn't

have a total of two starts in their NFL careers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers also have been speaking with defensive end Anthony
Pleasant, who spent the last two seasons with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers are close to agreeing to a contract with defensive
tackle Leonardo Carson of Auburn, a fourth-round draft pick. The
Chargers have signed just one of their eight draft picks.

Tobacco Industry Told To Pay $145B

   MIAMI (AP) -- A jury took less than five hours Friday to decide that the
tobacco industry should pay a record-shattering $145 billion in punitive damages
to sick Florida smokers -- an amount industry lawyers predicted would break the

digital music files falls within the parameters of the Audio Home Recording Act
of 1992, which permits copying music for personal use. The RIAA, which has sued
Napster of behalf of its members for copyright infringement, responded that the
federal law provides no legal haven for such action.

<HEADLINE> Council Approves $2.75M City Share  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- City Council members voted 8-6 Friday to
approve the city's $2.75 million share of a $4.5 million settlement
of the civil rights lawsuit filed by former Black Panther Geronimo
Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt spent 25 years in prison before his murder conviction was
overturned in 1997. The federal government is to pay him $1.75
million as its share of the settlement approved by a federal judge
April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 53, of Morgan City, La., now goes by the name Geronimo ji
Jaga. He was convicted in 1972 of robbing and fatally shooting
teacher Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court in 1968.
Pratt had maintained he was framed by a government informant
because of his Black Panther activities.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's wrongful conviction lawsuit claimed authorities knew he
was at a Black Panther meeting in Oakland at the time of the
killing because the FBI had him under surveillance. He also claimed
investigators hid and possibly destroyed wiretap evidence that
would have proved his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   An Orange County judge granted him a new trial in 1997. The Los
Angeles County district attorney decided against another
prosecution of Pratt because the only eyewitness, the victim's
husband, is now dead.
